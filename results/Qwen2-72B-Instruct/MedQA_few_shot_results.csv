A 67-year-old man with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of ringing sensation in his ear. He received this first course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 week ago. Pure tone audiometry shows a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB. The expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to which of the following actions?,E,"Correct Answer is: D, Generation of free radicals

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sensorineural hearing loss are consistent with ototoxicity, a known side effect of certain chemotherapeutic agents. Among the options given, the drug that generates free radicals is most likely to cause this side effect. An example of such a drug is cisplatin, which is used in the treatment of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Cisplatin generates free radicals, which can damage the hair cells in the inner ear, leading to hearing loss. The other options do not typically cause ototoxicity as a side effect.",Success

"A 47-year-old executive schedules an appointment his physician for a routine medical check-up. He currently has no complaints and claims to be “as fit as a fiddle.” The physical examination findings are unremarkable, except for a mid-systolic murmur heard in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids on auscultation. The physician instructs the patient to stand from a supine position with the stethoscope still placed on his chest. Which of the following changes would occur with this maneuver?",E,"Correct Answer is: E, A reduction in diastolic filling time

Explanation: The maneuver of standing from a supine position leads to a transient reduction in venous return to the heart due to pooling of blood in the lower extremities. This results in a reduction in diastolic filling time, which can accentuate a systolic murmur by decreasing the time available for blood to flow across a stenotic valve during diastole. The other options listed are not consistent with the hemodynamic changes that occur with this maneuver.",Success
"A microbiologist is studying the emergence of a virulent strain of the virus. After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection. Which of the following viruses is capable of undergoing the above-mentioned process?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Rotavirus

The process described in the question is known as reassortment or RNA recombination, which occurs in segmented viruses. Rotavirus is a segmented double-stranded RNA virus that can undergo reassortment when two different strains infect the same cell, leading to the emergence of new strains. Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Vaccinia virus are not segmented viruses and do not undergo reassortment. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that can undergo recombination, but not reassortment.",Success

The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with a hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), which is a common complication in hospitalized patients, especially those who have been hospitalized for a prolonged period or have underlying health conditions. The presence of fever, purulent cough, and new chest consolidation on radiography are indicative of a lung infection. The patient's hospitalization for a week and the fact that the infection developed during hospitalization increase the likelihood of a HAP caused by nosocomial pathogens.

Among the options provided, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Option A) is a common cause of HAP, particularly in patients who have been hospitalized for a prolonged period or have been on mechanical ventilation. It is a Gram-negative bacterium that is often resistant to multiple antibiotics, making it a challenging pathogen to treat. The other options, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (Option B), Haemophilus influenzae (Option D), and Staphylococcus aureus (Option E), are more commonly associated with community-acquired pneumonia. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Option C) could potentially cause pneumonia, but it is less likely in the context of a patient who has developed symptoms shortly after hospitalization and in the absence of risk factors for tuberculosis.",Success
"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother for worsening wheezing and shortness of breath over the past day. He has not had a fever, cough, vomiting, or diarrhea.

"A 53-year-old man with recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma is enrolled in a clinical trial for a novel chemotherapeutic agent that his physician believes may be beneficial to his condition. The novel drug was previously tested in a small population and is now undergoing a larger phase 3 trial in preparation for FDA approval. A dose-response trial had the following results:

10 mg dose - 6/59 patients demonstrated improvement
20 mg dose - 19/49 patients demonstrated improvement
30 mg dose - 26/53 patients demonstrated improvement
40 mg dose - 46/51 patients demonstrated improvement

The same trial also had the following safety profile:

20 mg dose - 5/49 patients had a treatment related adverse event
40 mg dose - 11/51 patients had a treatment related adverse event
60 mg dose - 15/42 patients had a treatment related adverse event
80 mg dose - 23/47 patients had a treatment related adverse event
100 mg dose - 47/52 patients had a treatment related adverse event

Based on this study, which of the following represents the most likely therapeutic index for this novel chemotherapeutic agent?",E,"The therapeutic index is a measure of the safety of a drug, defined as the ratio of the dose that produces toxicity in 50% of the population (TD50) to the dose that produces a therapeutic effect in 50% of the population (ED50). In this case, we are looking for the dose that maximizes the number of patients who demonstrate improvement while minimizing the number of patients who experience treatment-related adverse events.

From the data provided:

- The 40 mg dose resulted in improvement in 46/51 patients (90.2%) and treatment-related adverse events in 11/51 patients (21.6%).
- The 60 mg dose resulted in improvement in a higher percentage of patients, but the percentage of patients with treatment-related adverse events also increased to 15/42 (35.7%).
- The 80 mg dose resulted in improvement in a similar percentage of patients as the 60 mg dose but with a higher percentage of treatment-related adverse events (23/47, 48.9%).
- The 100 mg dose resulted in improvement in a high percentage of patients, but the percentage of patients with treatment-related adverse events was very high (47/52, 90.4%).

The 40 mg dose seems to be the optimal dose as it has a high percentage of patients demonstrating improvement and a relatively low percentage of patients experiencing treatment-related adverse events. Therefore, the ED50 is likely to be around the 40 mg dose, and the TD50 is likely to be around the 60 mg dose.

To calculate the therapeutic index, we need to find the dose that results in a 50% response for both improvement and adverse events. The data provided does not allow for precise calculation of the ED50 and TD50, but we can estimate based on the trends.

- The 40 mg dose is close to the ED50 since it results in improvement in 90% of patients, which is higher than 50%.
- The 60 mg dose is close to the TD50 since it results in adverse events in 35.7% of patients, which is closer to 50% than the lower doses.

Therefore, we can estimate the therapeutic index as the ratio of the 60 mg dose to the 40 mg dose, which is 1.5.

However, none of the provided options matches 1.5. Given the options, the closest value that could be considered as a reasonable estimate based on the data provided is:

Glucose: 129 mg/dL

What is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension?",A,"Correct Answer is: A, Aldosterone excess

The patient's symptoms of progressive fatigue and new onset muscle cramps, along with his laboratory values, suggest a diagnosis of hypokalemia (low potassium levels). Hypokalemia can be caused by several conditions, but in this case, the patient's history of hypertension and his use of hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic that can cause potassium loss, point to an underlying cause related to his hypertension.

The patient's laboratory values also show a high bicarbonate level (HCO3-: 33 mEq/L), which is consistent with metabolic alkalosis. This can be caused by an aldosterone excess, which leads to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the kidneys. The patient's hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis are all consistent with primary hyperaldosteronism, a condition characterized by an excess of aldosterone production, often due to an adrenal gland tumor or hyperplasia. This condition can lead to hypertension and electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia.

Therefore, the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension is an aldosterone excess (Option A). The other options (B, C, D, and E) do not fit as well with the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory values.",Success

He is a competitive swimmer and has had 8 sexual partners in the past year. He intermittently uses barrier protection. On exam, he is well-appearing and in no acute distress. His oral examination demonstrates patches of white pseudomembranes that can be wiped away to reveal erythematous mucosa. A medication with which of the following mechanisms of action is most appropriate in this patient?",A,"Correct Answer is: D, Inhibition of beta-glucan synthase

The patient's presentation is consistent with oral candidiasis, commonly known as thrush. The white patches that can be wiped away to reveal erythematous mucosa are characteristic of this condition. Candidiasis is caused by an overgrowth of Candida species, typically Candida albicans, which is a fungus. The most appropriate treatment for candidiasis is an antifungal medication.

Among the options provided, the mechanism of action that is most appropriate for treating candidiasis is the inhibition of beta-glucan synthase (option D). Beta-glucan synthase is an enzyme that is essential for the synthesis of beta-glucan, a major component of the fungal cell wall. Inhibitors of this enzyme, such as echinocandins, disrupt the integrity of the fungal cell wall, leading to cell death. However, in the context of oral candidiasis, topical or oral azoles (such as fluconazole) are more commonly used and are effective because they inhibit ergosterol synthesis, which is another critical component of the fungal cell membrane. While not listed in the options, azoles would also be an appropriate choice for treatment.

Disruption of cell membrane permeability (option A) is a mechanism of action for some antifungal agents, such as polyenes (e.g., amphotericin B), but this is not the most specific mechanism for treating candidiasis.

Disruption of microtubule formation (option B) is a mechanism of action for antimitotic agents used in chemotherapy, not antifungal therapy.

Inhibition of 14-alpha-demethylase (option C) is a mechanism of action for azole antifungal agents, which inhibit ergosterol synthesis. This is a relevant mechanism for treating candidiasis, but the most specific mechanism listed in the options is inhibition of beta-glucan synthase.

Inhibition of squalene epoxidase (option E) is a mechanism of action for some antifungal agents, such as terbinafine, but these are typically used for dermatophyte infections and not for candidiasis.",Success

A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of severe abdominal pain and bilious vomiting for 6 hours. He has not had bowel movements in the past 24 hours. He appears ill. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F) and pulse is 122/min. Examination shows a distended abdomen. There is tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen; guarding and rebound tenderness are present. Bowel sounds are decreased. An x-ray of the abdomen shows dilated loops of bowel. He has been accompanied by his 14-year-old brother. The surgeon recommends an emergency laparotomy. The parents are away visiting friends and cannot be reached. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?,D,"Correct Answer is: D, Perform emergency laparotomy

In this scenario, the 4-year-old boy is experiencing a medical emergency that requires immediate surgical intervention. Given the severity of his condition, waiting for parental consent could potentially worsen his outcome. In cases where a patient is a minor and the parents or legal guardians cannot be reached in a medical emergency, the healthcare provider has the authority to act in the best interest of the child to provide necessary medical treatment. This includes performing an emergency laparotomy to address the potential surgical cause of the abdominal pain and distension.",Success
"A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the hospital because of poor weight gain since birth. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation via normal vaginal delivery. He weighed 3005 g (6 lb, 10 oz) at birth and currently weighs 2835 g (6 lb, 4 oz). He has been latching on and breastfeeding well since birth. His mother has a history of Graves' disease and underwent near-total thyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy after her symptoms could not be controlled with antithyroid drugs. She is currently receiving L-thyroxine therapy. The patient's temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 176/min, and respirations are 42/min. He appears irritable. Examination shows a diaphoretic infant with a paucity of subcutaneous fat. There is swelling of the neck at the midline. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, Transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies

The newborn's symptoms of poor weight gain, irritability, tachycardia, and diaphoresis, along with his mother's history of Graves' disease and thyroidectomy, suggest that the infant may have neonatal thyrotoxicosis. This condition can be caused by the transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies from the mother to the fetus, leading to hyperstimulation of the fetal thyroid gland and subsequent thyrotoxicosis. The swelling of the neck at the midline may indicate an enlarged thyroid gland, further supporting this diagnosis.",Success
"A 57-year-old female with a past medical history of alcoholism presents to the emergency room vomiting bright red blood. She is accompanied by her partner, who reports that she had been complaining of black and tarry stools for the past several days. Vital signs are temperature 37 degrees celsius, heart rate 141 beats per minute, blood pressure 90/60, respiratory rate 20, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. On physical examination, she has splenomegaly and a positive fluid wave. The remainder of her examination is within normal limits. The patient is stabilized with intravenous fluids, and her blood pressure improves. Subsequent emergent upper endoscopy reveals bleeding from the submucosal veins in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus, but no gastric bleed. In the endoscopy suite she also receives IV octreotide. After intervention and resolution of her acute bleed, which of the following pharmacologic agents is indicated?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Nadolol

The patient's history of alcoholism, splenomegaly, positive fluid wave, and the location of the bleeding veins in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus are all consistent with a diagnosis of esophageal varices. This is a common complication of portal hypertension, which can occur in patients with liver cirrhosis due to alcoholism. Octreotide is often used acutely to control bleeding from esophageal varices, but long-term management typically involves beta-blockers, such as nadolol, to reduce portal venous pressure and prevent rebleeding.",Success
"A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension, obesity, and alcoholic cirrhosis is seen in clinic for follow-up. He feels well and currently drinks 5 glasses of wine each night. Medications include atenolol and lisinopril. On physical exam, temperature is 98.1 deg F (36.7 deg C), blood pressure is 151/82 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, and respirations are 14/min. He has spider angiomata on his chest; no asterixis, jaundice, ascites, or peripheral edema is noted. Screening ultrasound reveals a new liver nodule, and follow up CT demonstrates a 2 cm right hepatic lobe lesion with enhancement in the arterial phase. No hypodense attenuation is seen on the venous or delayed phase. What is the next step in management?",A,"Correct Answer is: E, Observe and get follow-up imaging in 3 months

Given the patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis and the imaging findings, the next step in management would be to observe and get follow-up imaging in 3 months. This is because the lesion is small and shows enhancement in the arterial phase without washout in the venous or delayed phase, which is not diagnostic of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The size and enhancement pattern of the lesion are more consistent with a benign lesion, such as a hemangioma or focal nodular hyperplasia. However, given the patient's risk factors, close monitoring is warranted to assess for any changes in the lesion's size or characteristics. Biopsy, surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, and treatment with sorafenib are more invasive or aggressive options that are typically reserved for confirmed or highly suspicious cases of HCC.",Success

He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications.

The patient presents with a history of alcohol use disorder, acute pancreatitis, and cirrhosis, and now has symptoms of infection, including fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. He also has hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness on examination. The ascitic fluid analysis is consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and the patient has developed acute kidney injury (oliguria, metabolic acidosis, and a low urine sodium level). The best treatment option for this patient, given his underlying liver disease and the development of complications such as SBP and acute kidney injury, is liver transplantation. This is because his liver disease is likely irreversible and he is at high risk for further complications. The other options listed are not appropriate for this patient. Adding dopamine or lisinopril to his treatment regimen would not address the underlying liver disease or the complications that have developed. Switching cefotaxime to ceftriaxone would not be necessary since the E. coli isolated from the ascitic fluid is sensitive to both antibiotics. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) may be considered in patients with portal hypertension and refractory ascites, but it is not the best treatment option for this patient since his primary issue is liver failure and the development of complications.",Success

"A post-mortem lung examination of a 68-year-old male overweight male with evidence of chronic lower extremity edema, a 60 pack-year smoking history and daily productive cough would be most likely to reveal:",B,"Correct Answer is: B, Reid Index > 50%

The Reid Index is a measure of the ratio of alveolar wall thickness to the diameter of the alveolar space. A Reid Index greater than 50% is indicative of pulmonary emphysema, a condition characterized by the destruction of the walls of the alveoli and enlargement of the air spaces. This is a common finding in smokers and in individuals with a history of chronic productive cough, as seen in this patient. The patient's history of chronic lower extremity edema and overweight status also suggest the possibility of right-sided heart failure, which can contribute to pulmonary hypertension and emphysema. The other options listed are not consistent with the patient's history or post-mortem findings.",Success
A 54-year-old male makes an appointment with his primary care physician due to chronic fatigue that has left him unable to hike or do other physically demanding activities with his friends. He has well-controlled hypertension and diabetes but has otherwise been healthy. He does not smoke but drinks socially with his friends.

Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows rectovaginal tenderness. Cervical and urethral swabs are negative. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,C,"Correct Answer is: C, Laparoscopy

The patient's symptoms of pelvic pain and dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse) that is not relieved by pain medication and the finding of rectovaginal tenderness on physical examination suggest a possible diagnosis of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside the uterus, often causing pelvic pain and other symptoms. While the transvaginal ultrasonography did not show any abnormalities, endometriosis can often be missed on ultrasound and requires laparoscopy for definitive diagnosis. Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that allows the surgeon to visualize the pelvic organs and look for signs of endometriosis, such as endometrial implants, adhesions, and cysts.

Which of the following lab abnormalities in this patient is an indication for treatment?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, High LDL-cholesterol

The patient's LDL-cholesterol level is 186 mg/dL, which is above the desirable level of 100 mg/dL and indicates a high risk of cardiovascular disease. This is particularly concerning given the patient's sedentary lifestyle, family history of heart disease, and elevated total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The other laboratory findings, while not ideal, do not necessarily indicate an immediate need for treatment. The blood pressure reading, while on the high side, is not yet in the hypertensive range. The patient's weight is not a laboratory finding but is indeed a concern given his obesity. The triglyceride level is within the borderline high range but not typically treated unless it is over 200 mg/dL and the patient has other risk factors. The fasting serum glucose level is slightly elevated but not indicative of diabetes.",Success
"A 26-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was a restrained passenger.

The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms has which of the following modes of inheritance?",A,"Correct Answer is: A, Autosomal dominant

The patient's symptoms and the finding of a large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels are indicative of a pulmonary embolism. Although the question does not provide a clear family history, the mode of inheritance that is most commonly associated with conditions that can lead to pulmonary embolism, such as Factor V Leiden mutation or antithrombin III deficiency, is autosomal dominant. These conditions can increase the risk of blood clots, which can lead to a pulmonary embolism. The fact that the patient's blood test results are within normal parameters after drug administration does not necessarily provide information about the mode of inheritance, but it does suggest that the cause of her symptoms is not due to an ongoing acute process that would be reflected in the blood test results.",Success

Thrombin time 34 s
 A non-contrast CT of the head is performed and shown in the picture. Which of the following would be the next best diagnostic step in this patient?",A,"Correct Answer is: A, Mixing study

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a possible coagulation disorder, specifically a deficiency or inhibitor in one of the coagulation factors. The prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is indicative of this. A mixing study can help determine if the cause is a factor deficiency or the presence of an inhibitor. In a mixing study, the patient's plasma is mixed with normal plasma and the aPTT is rechecked. If the aPTT returns to normal, it suggests a factor deficiency. If the aPTT remains prolonged, it suggests the presence of an inhibitor.",Success

A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head is shown. Which of the following most likely explains this patient’s symptoms?",A,"Correct Answer is: A, Herniation of the uncus

The patient's symptoms and the findings on physical examination, particularly the left pupil being 6 mm and non-reactive to light and a right-sided visual field defect, suggest a left-sided intracranial lesion with resulting herniation. The CT scan would likely show a left-sided intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect causing the symptoms. The uncus is a structure located in the temporal lobe, and herniation of the uncus can lead to compression of the third cranial nerve, causing a dilated and non-reactive pupil on the ipsilateral side and a contralateral hemiparesis.",Success
"A 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after the results of serum protein electrophoresis showed monoclonal gammopathy. A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Which of the following best describes this class of immune cells?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Natural killer cells",Success
"A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive muscle weakness for five months. She feels that the muscles in her shoulders and hips have been getting weaker and sometimes feel sore. She now has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. She has also noticed new difficulty with swallowing solid foods, but has no trouble with liquids. She has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia controlled with fluvastatin. Her maternal uncle died at age 26 from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and her mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Vital signs are within normal limits.

Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""",A,"Correct Answer is: C, Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy

The patient's symptoms of progressive muscle weakness, particularly in the shoulder and hip girdles, along with difficulty swallowing solid foods, suggest a myopathic process. The laboratory findings, including an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and mild elevations in creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, AST, and ALT, are consistent with an inflammatory myopathy. The absence of difficulty with liquids and the lack of deep tendon reflex abnormalities further support this diagnosis. The patient's family history of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and Hashimoto's thyroiditis are not directly relevant to her current presentation. A muscle biopsy showing perifascicular and perivascular infiltration is characteristic of dermatomyositis or polymyositis, which are inflammatory myopathies.",Success
"A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency room with sudden onset of blurry vision one hour ago. He states that he was resting at home when he noticed he had difficulty reading. Currently, he is also starting to see double, and is seeing two images on top of each other.

Past medical history is noncontributory. She takes a multivitamin with iron and folate every day and has been receiving regular prenatal care and the pregnancy is progressing normally. On examination, an erythematous rash is seen on her right arm, as shown in the accompanying photograph. Her obstetric examination is normal. Ultrasound of the fetus is reassuring with a normal heartbeat and no gross abnormalities. A specimen is collected to test for Lyme disease. What is the next best step for this patient?",D,"Correct Answer is: B, Doxycycline

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and the erythematous rash on her right arm suggest a diagnosis of Lyme disease, which is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for Lyme disease in non-pregnant adults and is considered safe to use during pregnancy. Ibuprofen can help with pain and fever but does not treat the underlying infection. Tetracycline is not recommended during pregnancy due to potential harm to the fetus. Amoxicillin is an alternative treatment for Lyme disease, but doxycycline is preferred. Gentamicin is not used to treat Lyme disease.",Success

She is at the 2ndpercentile for height and 35th percentile for weight. Breast development is Tanner stage 2. Pubic and axillary hair is absent. An x-ray of the left hand and wrist shows a bone age of 11 years. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Reassurance and follow-up

The patient's history of a father with short stature during his teenage years, her current height and weight percentiles, and the bone age being less than her chronological age are all consistent with constitutional growth delay, which is a normal variant of growth. Constitutional growth delay is characterized by a delay in the onset of puberty and a delayed bone age, which results in short stature during childhood and adolescence. However, these individuals typically catch up in height during late adolescence and reach a final adult height within the normal range. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be reassurance and follow-up to monitor her growth and development. Genetic karyotyping, pelvic ultrasound, and measurement of serum dehydroepiandrosterone levels are not indicated in this case as there is no evidence of a genetic disorder, ovarian dysfunction, or adrenal insufficiency, respectively. An MRI of the brain is also not indicated as there is no evidence of a central nervous system lesion that could be causing her short stature.",Success

Her vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person, place, and time. She reports feeling anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Cognitive behavioral therapy

The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of anxiety disorder, specifically generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), characterized by excessive worry and anxiety about various aspects of life, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, irritability, and muscle tension. The patient's shoplifting behavior appears to be a maladaptive coping mechanism for her anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based treatment for anxiety disorders, including GAD. CBT focuses on identifying and challenging negative thought patterns and behaviors, and developing more adaptive coping strategies. It is often the first-line treatment for anxiety disorders, particularly in cases where the patient is not currently experiencing any other psychiatric symptoms that might require medication. Lithium is typically used to treat bipolar disorder, not anxiety disorders. Interpersonal therapy and psychodynamic psychotherapy may also be effective treatments for anxiety disorders, but they are not as well-established as CBT. Motivational interviewing is typically used to help patients overcome ambivalence about behavior change, but it is not typically used as a primary treatment for anxiety disorders.",Success
"A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a change in his behavior over the past few months.

The rash features thin-walled, fluid-filled blisters that rupture easily. Fluid samples from the lesions are sent for analysis to a microbiology lab. The results reveal an infection by the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is diagnosed with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Which of the following is involved with the primary defense in response to the bacteria and toxins produced by this organism?",E,"Correct Answer is: A, Immunoglobulin- IgG

In the context of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), the primary defense mechanism against Staphylococcus aureus and its toxins involves the adaptive immune system, particularly the production of antibodies. Among the options provided, IgG (Immunoglobulin G) is the most common type of antibody and plays a crucial role in the secondary immune response against bacterial infections. IgG antibodies can neutralize toxins, opsonize bacteria for phagocytosis, and activate the complement system, all of which are important in the defense against S. aureus and its exotoxins.",Success

The patient's symptoms of perioral numbness and upper-extremity muscle cramping, along with the observation of a hand spasm during blood pressure measurement, suggest hypocalcemia. The patient's history of a recent total thyroidectomy and the low levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the blood are consistent with post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia due to damage to or removal of the parathyroid glands during surgery. The low level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D is also indicative of vitamin D deficiency, which can contribute to hypocalcemia, but the immediate concern is the hypocalcemia. Administering calcium gluconate can rapidly correct the hypocalcemia and alleviate the patient's symptoms.",Success

His mother reports intermittent episodes of jaundice with joint and bone pain since he was 5 months old. At presentation, the patient’s vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals slight jaundice and pale conjunctiva. The spleen is tender and easily palpable. After a complete blood count with differential and an abdominal ultrasound, the patient is found to have sickle-cell disease with splenic infarct. A partial splenectomy is performed. After the operation, the physician provides vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The picture shows a slide obtained from the resected portion of the patient’s spleen. Dysfunction of the zone marked with which number predisposes the patient to the aforementioned infections?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, 1 and 2

The image is not provided, but based on the question, the answer is determined by the function of the spleen. The spleen has a critical role in filtering blood and fighting infections. The zones marked 1 and 2 most likely represent the white pulp and red pulp of the spleen, respectively. The white pulp contains lymphocytes and is responsible for recognizing and responding to pathogens, while the red pulp filters blood and removes old or damaged red blood cells. Dysfunction in either of these zones can lead to an increased susceptibility to infections, particularly encapsulated bacteria like Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.",Success

"A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, weight loss, and muscle aches during the past 2 months. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. Her only medication is a multivitamin. A metyrapone stimulation test is performed and the results rule out a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Which of the following changes in laboratory findings are most likely to have been observed in this patient following the administration of the drug?",A,"Correct Answer is: B, Decrease in urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids

Metyrapone is a drug that blocks the synthesis of cortisol by inhibiting the enzyme 11-β-hydroxylase. This results in a decrease in cortisol production and an increase in the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary gland. The decrease in cortisol production leads to a decrease in urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids, which are the metabolites of cortisol. Therefore, the most likely change in laboratory findings in this patient following the administration of metyrapone would be a decrease in urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids.",Success
An investigator conducts a study to determine whether earlier detection of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in patients increases survival time. One subset of study participants consists of asymptomatic individuals who were diagnosed with GBM after undergoing a screening MRI of the brain.

He has never felt like this before. Past medical history is insignificant. His blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, pulse 86/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F). A T2-weighted MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. The patient is treated with cervical immobilization, a course of steroids, and physical therapy. What other finding will most likely be seen in this patient?",D,"Correct Answer is: B, Right-sided Horner's syndrome

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and the MRI findings suggest a spinal cord injury at the C5 level. A hemicord lesion at this level would result in ipsilateral spastic paralysis below the level of the lesion and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation one to two levels below the lesion. However, the question asks for an additional finding that is most likely to be seen in this patient. A right-sided Horner's syndrome would be consistent with a lesion at the C5 level, as it would affect the descending sympathetic fibers that cross over at this level. Horner's syndrome is characterized by miosis (constricted pupil), ptosis (drooping eyelid), and anhidrosis (absence of sweating) on the affected side.",Success
"A previously healthy 19-year-old man comes to the physician with right-sided, dull, throbbing scrotal pain for 12 hours.

This patient's presentation is consistent with gynecomastia, which is the benign enlargement of glandular tissue in the male breast. It is common during puberty due to hormonal changes. The patient's history of cryptorchidism and ADHD, as well as his current medications and family history, do not suggest any of the other options as being more likely. Klinefelter syndrome would likely present with additional symptoms, such as small testes and tall stature. Lipomastia refers to an increase in fat tissue rather than glandular tissue. Testicular cancer would not typically present with breast symptoms, and medication side effects from methylphenidate are not typically associated with breast enlargement.",Success
"A 35-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency room with unilateral leg swelling. She reports that she developed painful left-sided leg swelling and redness earlier in the day. She is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. She denies any recent prolonged travel. She experienced a similar episode affecting the opposite leg one year ago and was diagnosed with a thrombus in the right femoral vein. On examination, the left leg is erythematous and swollen. Passive dorsiflexion of the left ankle elicits pain in the left calf. Ultrasound of the leg reveals a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. A genetic workup reveals that she has an inherited condition. What is the most likely pathophysiology of this patient’s condition?",E,"Correct Answer is: C, Deficiency in protein C

The patient's history of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and the presence of a thrombus in the left popliteal vein on ultrasound examination suggest an underlying hypercoagulable state.

"A 78-year-old man is brought to the physician by his daughter because of increasing forgetfulness over the past 5 weeks. He had been living independently but came to live with his daughter temporarily after he complained that he was unable to perform some of his daily activities. He has left the front door wide open and tap water running on multiple occasions. He does not sleep well and wakes up 6–7 times during the night. He does not leave his room and rarely makes conversation with his daughter. He says that he used to enjoy playing the piano but has not played for several months. He has hypertension treated with amlodipine. Vital signs are within normal limits. Mental status examination shows orientation to person, place, and time and psychomotor retardation. He has a blunted affect. Short- and long-term memory is impaired. Attention and concentration are impaired. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum concentration of electrolytes, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and vitamin B12 are within the reference range. He is very concerned about his memory lapses. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",B,"Correct Answer is: A, Donepezil

The patient's symptoms are consistent with Alzheimer's disease, which is a common cause of dementia in the elderly. Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that can help improve cognitive function and memory in patients with Alzheimer's disease. It is not a cure, but it can slow down the progression of symptoms and improve quality of life for the patient and their caregivers. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant that could be considered if the patient had significant depression, but the primary concern here is cognitive impairment. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent used for cardiovascular disease prevention and has no role in the treatment of dementia. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is used to treat hydrocephalus, which is not indicated in this case. Memantine is another medication used to treat moderate to severe dementia, but donepezil is typically the first-line treatment for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.",Success
"A previously healthy 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for evaluation of an abdominal mass noticed a few days ago. He appears markedly pale and lethargic. Examination shows a 6-cm, nonmobile mass in the left upper quadrant that crosses the midline. 24-hour urine collection shows elevated homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid. Further evaluation including biopsy confirms the diagnosis of intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. The physician recommends the established standard treatment, which is initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, the likelihood of unresectability without neoadjuvant treatment, and the prognosis without it, the patient's parents steadily refuse chemotherapy because they do not want their son to suffer the side effects. They prefer to take their son home for supportive care only. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Seek a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy

In cases of life-threatening conditions where the standard treatment is chemotherapy, and the parents refuse treatment, the physician may need to seek legal intervention to ensure that the child receives appropriate medical care. In this case, the child has intermediate-risk neuroblastoma, and the standard treatment is neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection if possible. The parents' refusal of chemotherapy puts the child's life at risk. Therefore, the physician should seek a court order to override the parents' decision and provide the child with the necessary medical treatment.",Success

"An investigator is studying the effect of drug X on the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene on chromosome 13 in endometrial cells. Endometrial cells obtained from study participants are plated on growth media and the distribution of cell cycle phase is measured with flow cytometry. Drug X, which is known to activate cyclin-dependent kinase 4, is administered to all the cells, and the distribution of cell cycle phase is measured again 1 hour later. Which of the following is most likely to result from the action of drug X on the Rb gene?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, Initiation of S phase

The retinoblastoma (Rb) gene is a tumor suppressor gene that plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle, particularly in the transition from G1 phase to S phase. When the Rb gene is active, it binds to E2F transcription factors, preventing them from initiating the transcription of genes necessary for S phase and DNA replication. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) is involved in the phosphorylation of the Rb protein, which inactivates it and allows E2F to initiate the transcription of genes necessary for S phase. Therefore, if drug X activates CDK4, it will lead to the inactivation of Rb, allowing the cells to progress from G1 phase into S phase.",Success

"A 25-year-old male is hospitalized for acute agitation, photophobia, and dysphagia. His parents report that he has been experiencing flu-like symptoms for one week prior to hospital admission. Five weeks ago, the patient was in Mexico, where he went on several spelunking expeditions with friends. The patient ultimately becomes comatose and dies. Autopsy of brain tissue suggests a viral infection. The likely causal virus spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) in the following manner:",C,"Correct Answer is: C, Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons

The clinical presentation of acute agitation, photophobia, and dysphagia, along with the history of spelunking in Mexico, suggests a diagnosis of rabies. Rabies virus typically gains access to the CNS via retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons, particularly after a bite or scratch from an infected animal. In this case, the patient's spelunking activity may have exposed him to bats, which are a common reservoir for rabies virus.",Success

The patient's laboratory results indicate metabolic acidosis with a low bicarbonate level (HCO3-) and a normal anion gap. The urine pH of 7.0 suggests a renal tubular acidosis (RTA) type IV, which is characterized by an inability of the kidneys to acidify urine, resulting in a urine pH that is not appropriately acidic in the setting of metabolic acidosis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a drug that can cause RTA type IV by inhibiting the renal tubular secretion of hydrogen ions, leading to an inability to acidify urine and subsequent metabolic acidosis.",Success

The patient's free T3 level is low (0.1 ng/dL), which is indicative of central hypothyroidism. The free T4 level is also low (0.9 ng/dL), but within the normal range. The TSH level is normal (1.8 µU/mL), which suggests that the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is not stimulating the thyroid gland adequately. This could be due to the critical illness, which can cause a decrease in T3 levels as part of the sick euthyroid syndrome. However, the low T3 level in this patient is more severe than what is typically seen in sick euthyroid syndrome, and the low T4 level supports a diagnosis of central hypothyroidism.

"A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a progressively growing mass in his axilla. During this period, he has had recurrent episodes of low-grade fever lasting for 7 to 10 days, and an 8-kg (18-lb) weight loss. His only medication is a multivitamin. Physical examination shows nontender, right axillary, cervical, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. His serum calcium concentration is 15.1 mg/dL and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration is 9 pg/mL. A lymph node biopsy shows granuloma formation and large CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's laboratory findings?",D,"Correct Answer is: E, Production of PTH-related peptide by malignant cells

The patient's symptoms of a progressively growing mass in his axilla, recurrent low-grade fever, and significant weight loss, combined with the physical examination findings of nontender lymphadenopathy in multiple regions, and the laboratory findings of hypercalcemia (elevated serum calcium concentration) and low PTH concentration, are most consistent with a diagnosis of malignancy, specifically a type of lymphoma given the description of the lymph node biopsy. The presence of granuloma formation and large CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei is characteristic of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL).

Hypercalcemia in malignancy is often due to the production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) by the tumor cells. PTHrP has a similar amino acid sequence to PTH and can bind to the same receptors on bone and kidney, leading to increased bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption, resulting in hypercalcemia. The low PTH concentration in this case is consistent with the production of PTHrP by the tumor cells rather than increased release of PTH by the parathyroid glands.

The other options provided are not consistent with the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings. Excessive intake of dietary ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) could lead to hypercalcemia, but it would not explain the low PTH concentration or the presence of a malignancy. Increased release of PTH by parathyroid chief cells would result in hyperparathyroidism, which would be associated with an elevated PTH concentration rather than a low PTH concentration. Induction of focal osteolysis by tumor cells could contribute to hypercalcemia, but it would not explain the low PTH concentration. Secretion of γ-interferon by activated T-lymphocytes is not typically associated with hypercalcemia or low PTH concentration.",Success

A biopsy of this patient's lesion would most likely demonstrate which of the following findings?",B,"Correct Answer is: E, Stromal amyloid deposition

The patient's presentation with a firm, painless neck mass, fatigue, and weight gain, along with a family history of medullary thyroid cancer, raises suspicion for a thyroid disorder. The specific finding of a firm, symmetric, and stone-firm thyroid on examination is suggestive of amyloid deposition, which is a characteristic feature of medullary thyroid carcinoma. This type of cancer can present with a variety of symptoms, including a neck mass, and is associated with amyloid deposition in the stroma.

"A group of researchers decided to explore whether the estimates of incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were influenced by the number of years it took to examine administrative data. These estimates were not only based on hospital discharges, but also on physician billing codes. For study purposes, the researchers labeled incident cases at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases were those that were coded as harboring SLE at any time, with patients maintaining their diagnosis until death. Which statement is true regarding the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study?",B,"Correct Answer is: B, Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.

Explanation: Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a disease that develop in a population during a specified time period. In contrast, prevalence is the total number of cases (new and existing) of a disease in a population at a given time. The longer the time period, the more likely it is that some of the incident cases will have resolved or progressed to a different stage of the disease, leading to a lower incidence rate. However, the prevalence rate will increase over time as the disease persists in the population. Therefore, examining successively longer time periods will result in substantially higher prevalence estimates, not lower, so option A is incorrect. Option C is incorrect because shorter time windows will not necessarily overestimate the prevalence of SLE; in fact, they may underestimate it if some cases have not yet been diagnosed. Options D and E are incorrect because attack rates are not relevant to this study, which is focused on incidence and prevalence rates.",Success

pH 7.44
pO2 54 mm Hg
pCO2 31 mm Hg
HCO3- 22 mm Hg
Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?""",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Increase PEEP

Rationale: The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a low pO2 (hypoxemia) and a low pCO2 (hypocapnia) with a normal pH, indicating a respiratory alkalosis. The presence of bilateral rales on lung examination suggests pulmonary edema, which can be associated with a low oxygenation status. Increasing the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can help to maintain alveolar recruitment, improve oxygenation, and reduce the shunt fraction in the lungs. This is a common strategy in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other conditions associated with alveolar collapse or pulmonary edema. Increasing the FiO2 or tidal volume may not address the underlying issue of alveolar collapse and could potentially lead to other complications such as barotrauma or oxygen toxicity. Increasing the respiratory rate may also not be beneficial as it could exacerbate the hypocapnia. Extubation is not appropriate given the patient's hypoxemia and need for mechanical ventilation support.",Success

"A 49-year-old woman comes to the physician for a scheduled colposcopy. Two weeks ago, she had a routine Pap smear that showed atypical squamous cells. Colposcopy shows an area of white discoloration of the cervix with application of acetic acid solution. Biopsy of this area shows carcinoma-in-situ. Activation of which of the following best explains the pathogenesis of this condition?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, E2F transcription factors

Explanation: The development of cervical cancer, including carcinoma-in-situ, is often associated with the infection by high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types, such as HPV-16 and HPV-18. These viruses encode E6 and E7 oncoproteins that disrupt cell cycle regulation by targeting tumor suppressor proteins p53 and Rb, respectively. The inactivation of Rb by E7 leads to the release and activation of E2F transcription factors, which promote cell cycle progression and cellular proliferation. This disruption of normal cell cycle control contributes to the pathogenesis of cervical cancer.",Success
"A research group has developed a low-cost diagnostic retinal imaging device for cytomegalovirus retinitis in a population of HIV-infected patients. In a pilot study of 50 patients, the imaging test detected the presence of CMV retinitis in 50% of the patients. An ophthalmologist slit lamp examination, which was performed for each patient to serve as the gold standard for diagnosis, confirmed a diagnosis of CMV retinitis in 20 patients that were found to be positive through imaging, as well as 1 patient who tested negative with the device. If the prevalence of CMV retinitis in the population decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, how will positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the diagnostic test be affected?",B,"Correct Answer is: B, PPV decreases, NPV increases

Explanation: The positive predictive value (PPV) is the proportion of positive test results that are true positive. The negative predictive value (NPV) is the proportion of negative test results that are true negative. When the prevalence of a disease decreases, the PPV tends to decrease because there are fewer true positives in the population, which means that a positive test result is more likely to be a false positive. Conversely, the NPV tends to increase because there are more true negatives in the population, which means that a negative test result is more likely to be a true negative. In this case, if the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, the PPV will decrease and the NPV will increase.",Success

"A 40-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painless right-sided scrotal swelling. The patient reports that he first noticed the swelling several weeks ago, but it is not always present. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. His father was diagnosed with a seminoma at the age of 25 years. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 10-cm, soft, cystic, nontender right scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are most consistent with a hydrocele, which is an accumulation of fluid in the tunica vaginalis, the double-layered membrane that surrounds the testis. The tunica vaginalis normally secretes and resorbs fluid to lubricate the testis. In a hydrocele, there is an imbalance in this process, leading to fluid accumulation. The fact that the mass is soft, cystic, and nontender, and that it transilluminates, are all characteristic of a hydrocele. The absence of bowel sounds and the lack of reduction when the patient is in a supine position rule out a hernia. The patient's smoking history and his father's history of seminoma are not directly relevant to the diagnosis of a hydrocele.",Success

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, Reassurance

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of a possible episode of appendicitis, but the laboratory results and the absence of fever, nausea, or vomiting do not strongly support this diagnosis. The normal white blood cell count and the absence of leukocytosis, as well as the normal C-reactive protein level, indicate a low likelihood of acute inflammation. The patient's history of a similar episode that resolved on its own and the lack of other significant findings on physical examination suggest that this may be a self-limiting condition. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to provide reassurance, monitor the patient's symptoms, and consider repeating the examination and laboratory tests if the symptoms persist or worsen.",Success

A chest X-ray reveals a flattened diaphragm and no signs of consolidation. Pulmonary function testing reveals FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%. Arterial blood gases (ABG) of this patient are most likely to reveal which of the following?",B,"Correct Answer is: B, Primary respiratory acidosis

The patient's history of smoking, chronic cough, and physical examination findings of a barrel-shaped chest and pursed-lip breathing are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The pulmonary function test showing an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% confirms the presence of airflow obstruction. The patient's symptoms of worsening shortness of breath, body aches, headache, and fever suggest an acute exacerbation of COPD, possibly due to a viral infection.

In COPD, the reduced lung function leads to decreased ventilation, which can result in the retention of carbon dioxide (CO2). This leads to a primary respiratory acidosis, as the body is unable to adequately exhale CO2, causing an increase in arterial CO2 levels (PaCO2). The body compensates for this acidosis by increasing bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels in the blood, but the primary disturbance is the respiratory acidosis.",Success
A 34-year-old male suffers from inherited hemophilia A. He and his wife have three unaffected daughters. What is the probability that the second daughter is a carrier of the disease?,E,"Correct Answer is: E, 100%

Osmolality 326 mOsmol/kg H2O
A CT scan of the head shows an unchanged right-sided subdural hematoma. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Fluid restriction

The patient's symptoms of fatigue and headache, along with her laboratory results showing hyponatremia (serum Na+ 130 mEq/L) and low serum osmolality (270 mOsmol/kg H2O), suggest that she is experiencing dilutional hyponatremia, also known as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). This condition is characterized by the excessive release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to water retention and a dilution of serum sodium. Fluid restriction is the initial treatment for SIADH, as it helps to reduce the excess water in the body and allow the serum sodium to normalize. The other options listed are not appropriate for the management of SIADH in this patient. Head elevation may help with symptoms of headache but does not address the underlying cause of the hyponatremia. Tolvaptan is a vasopressin receptor antagonist that can be used to treat SIADH, but it is typically reserved for cases that do not respond to fluid restriction. Desmopressin is a synthetic ADH analog used to treat conditions such as diabetes insipidus and is contraindicated in SIADH. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic used to reduce intracranial pressure and is not indicated for the management of hyponatremia in this patient.",Success

A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital for treatment of unstable angina. Cardiac catheterization shows occlusion that has caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery. Resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased by what factor relative to a vessel with no occlusion?,B,"Correct Answer is: B, 16

The relationship between the diameter of a vessel and the resistance to blood flow is described by the Poiseuille's Law. According to this law, the resistance to blood flow is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the vessel. This means that a 50% reduction in the diameter (which is equivalent to a 50% reduction in the radius) of the vessel would result in a 16-fold increase in resistance to blood flow (2^4 = 16).",Success

"A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with sudden onset of slurred speech. The patient’s eldest daughter says that he couldn’t move his arm during the episode. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and a hemorrhagic stroke 6 years ago, which was treated surgically. After admission, the patient gets increasingly worse and loses consciousness. A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain. The patient’s daughter is asked to consent to a non-emergent, life-saving operation since the patient is in a comatose state. She does not consent to the operation even though the physician stresses it would be life-saving. Upon further discussion, the physician finds out that the patient was abusive and neglectful to his children, and the daughter wants “to live in peace.” The patient has no written advanced directive. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?",C,"Correct Answer is: B, Refer this case to the court

In this scenario, the patient is in a comatose state and unable to make decisions for himself, and he has no written advanced directive. The daughter, who is the patient's eldest and presumably the primary contact, refuses to consent to a life-saving operation. The physician should not perform the surgery without consent (Option D) or report the daughter to the police (Option E) as these actions would be unethical and potentially illegal. Contacting another family member for consent (Option C) could be a reasonable step, but if the other family members are not immediately available or if there is a disagreement among family members, the most appropriate course of action would be to refer the case to the court for a decision on the patient's best interests. This would allow for a legal determination of the appropriate course of action, taking into account the patient's medical condition, the potential benefits and risks of the surgery, and the ethical considerations involved.",Success

Which one of the following is the best choice to provide informed consent for this procedure?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Informed consent is not needed in this case

In emergency situations where a patient is unconscious and unable to give informed consent, and there is an immediate threat to the patient's life, medical professionals are allowed to proceed with life-saving interventions without prior consent. This is known as the ""implied consent"" doctrine, which allows healthcare providers to act in the best interest of the patient when there is no time to obtain consent from the patient or their legal representatives. In this case, the patient's condition is critical, and immediate action is necessary to address the tension pneumothorax, which is a life-threatening condition.

The calf pain could indicate a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a common source of emboli that can lead to PE. A ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan is a sensitive and specific test for diagnosing PE. It evaluates the ventilation and perfusion of the lungs and can help identify areas of mismatch, which are indicative of PE. Other tests, such as a CT scan or lower extremity doppler, may also be indicated but are not the best initial test in this scenario. Immediate anticoagulation with a medication like fondaparinux may also be necessary, but the diagnosis should be confirmed first.",Success

Which of the following physiological pregnancy changes is causing the change in this patient’s condition?",C,"Correct Answer is: D, Increase in cardiac output

The patient's pre-existing heart condition, likely a congenital heart defect given her history of a murmur since childhood, is exacerbated by the physiological changes that occur during pregnancy. The most significant of these changes that would affect a heart condition is the increase in cardiac output, which typically increases by 30-50% during pregnancy to meet the increased metabolic demands of the mother and the fetus. This increased workload on the heart can lead to symptoms such as dyspnea and cyanosis in patients with underlying cardiac conditions, as seen in this case.",Success

There is increased tone in the lower extremities and Babinski's sign is positive bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"Correct Answer is: A, Cerebellar demyelination

The patient's symptoms, including the low-frequency tremor that worsens with target-directed movements, overshooting of targets, and increased tone in the lower extremities with positive Babinski's sign, are most consistent with cerebellar dysfunction. The presence of a tremor that is exacerbated by intentional movements (intention tremor) and overshooting of targets (dysmetria) are characteristic of cerebellar involvement. The positive Babinski's sign and increased tone in the lower extremities also suggest involvement of the corticospinal tract, which can occur in conditions affecting the cerebellum. While Parkinson's disease (option B) is a possibility given the patient's family history, the clinical presentation is more consistent with cerebellar involvement. Essential tremor (option D) typically does not present with the overshooting of targets or increased tone seen in this patient. Degeneration of the caudate nucleus (option C) is primarily associated with Huntington's disease, which typically presents with chorea rather than tremor. Subthalamic nucleus stroke (option E) can cause tremor, but it would not explain the patient's overshooting of targets or increased tone in the lower extremities.",Success

Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",C,"The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms is an antihistamine, specifically either diphenhydramine (Option A) or fexofenadine (Option C). Both of these medications are effective in treating allergic reactions, including symptoms such as pruritus (itching), erythematous plaques (red, raised skin lesions), nasal discharge, and sneezing. Given the patient's history of symptoms occurring after eating at a seafood restaurant and the absence of infection (as indicated by the lack of tenderness in the paranasal sinuses), an allergic reaction is the most likely diagnosis. Of the two antihistamines listed, fexofenadine (Option C) is a second-generation antihistamine that is less sedating than diphenhydramine (Option A), which is a first-generation antihistamine.

She returns 1 week later stating that her symptoms have not improved. She is requesting help as her performance at work and school is suffering. Which of the following is the best next step in management?,D,"Correct Answer is: B, Change treatment to duloxetine

Rationale: The patient is presenting symptoms of depression which include fatigue, anhedonia, and insomnia. Duloxetine is an antidepressant that can be used as a second-line therapy if the initial treatment is not effective. Lithium is typically used for bipolar disorder and electroconvulsive therapy is usually a last resort for severe, treatment-resistant depression. Continuing the current therapy without any improvement in symptoms is not a good option.

Rubella IgG - 1:128 Rubella IgG - 1:64
Rubella IgG avidity - high Rubella IgG avidity - high
What is the proper next step in the management of this woman?",D,"Correct Answer is: A. Reassure and recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum

The patient's serology results indicate that she has a high titer of rubella IgG antibodies with high avidity, which suggests a past infection or vaccination. Her IgM antibodies are negative, which rules out an acute infection. Given her history of exposure to her sister with rubella and the timing of her symptoms, it is likely that she is experiencing a reactivation of her immune response to the virus, rather than an acute infection. The absence of IgM antibodies and the high avidity of her IgG antibodies indicate that she is not at risk of transmitting rubella to her fetus, and therefore, pregnancy termination is not indicated. Chorionic villus sampling is an invasive procedure that carries a risk of miscarriage and is not indicated in this case. Parvovirus B19 can cause a similar rash, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a rubella reactivation, and additional testing for parvovirus B19 is not necessary. Rubella virus PCR is not indicated since the patient's IgM antibodies are negative, indicating that she is not experiencing an acute infection. Therefore, the proper next step in the management of this woman is to reassure her and recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum.",Success

Furosemide is a loop diuretic commonly used in the treatment of heart failure to reduce fluid overload, which would be consistent with the patient's presentation and improvement with medical therapy.",Success
"A 23-year-old woman is seen by her primary care physician for fatigue. She says that she has always felt a little short of breath compared to her friends; however, she did not think that it was abnormal until she started trying a new exercise regimen. On physical exam, she is found to have mild conjunctival pallor and a peripheral blood smear is obtained showing echinocytes but no intracellular accumulations. Upon further questioning, she recalls that several relatives have had similar issues with fatigue and pallor in the past. Which of the following is true about the rate limiting enzyme of the biochemical pathway that is affected by this patient's most likely condition?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, It is inhibited by protein kinase A activity

The patient's symptoms and peripheral blood smear findings suggest a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis, a disorder characterized by the production of abnormally shaped red blood cells (spherocytes) that are more fragile and have a shorter lifespan than normal red blood cells. The rate-limiting enzyme of the biochemical pathway affected by hereditary spherocytosis is pyruvate kinase, which is inhibited by protein kinase A activity. Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the final step in glycolysis, the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, and is important for maintaining the energy supply in red blood cells. In hereditary spherocytosis, mutations in the pyruvate kinase gene lead to reduced enzyme activity, resulting in decreased ATP production and increased red blood cell fragility.",Success

Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?""",E,"Correct Answer is: B, Phagocytosis of autoantibody-opsonized platelets

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a condition that occurs when antibodies form against a complex of heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4), leading to platelet activation and aggregation, and subsequent consumption of platelets. The clinical presentation includes new thrombotic events (in this case, a possible deep vein thrombosis in the right leg) and thrombocytopenia. The patient's recent exposure to prophylactic unfractionated heparin and the presence of hematomas around the IV sites also support the diagnosis of HIT. The mechanism underlying HIT involves the formation of autoantibodies that opsonize platelets, leading to their phagocytosis by macrophages.",Success

Physical exam is remarkable for petechiae and scattered ecchymoses on the patient's bilateral upper and lower extremities. Urine beta-HCG is negative. Laboratory results are as follows: Hgb 13.0 g/dL, WBCs 6,000/mL, platelets 95,000/mL, PT 13.2s, aPTT 30s. Peripheral blood smear shows normocytic, normochromic red blood cells and few platelets with no morphologic abnormalities. Which diagnostic study should be performed next?",D,"Correct Answer is: E, Bone marrow aspiration

The patient's symptoms of increased menstrual bleeding, easy bruising, and bleeding from her gums, along with the physical exam findings of petechiae and ecchymoses, suggest a possible coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia. The laboratory results show a low platelet count, which is consistent with thrombocytopenia. The normocytic, normochromic red blood cells on the peripheral blood smear and the normal hemoglobin level suggest that anemia is not the primary issue. The normal PT and aPTT values make a coagulation factor deficiency less likely. 

Given the patient's low platelet count, the next best step would be to evaluate the bone marrow to determine the cause of the thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow aspiration can help differentiate between conditions such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which could also be considered in the differential diagnosis. The other options (A, B, C, and D) are not the most appropriate next steps in this case, as they do not directly address the cause of the thrombocytopenia.",Success

"A research group has created a novel screening test for a rare disorder. A robust clinical trial is performed in a group of 100 subjects comparing the new screening test against the gold standard. The results are given in the table below:
Screening test\gold standard Disease present Disease absent
Positive 45 15
Negative 5 35
Which of the following is most correct regarding the statistical power of this new screening test?",E,"Correct Answer is: E, If the sensitivity of this screening test were decreased, the statistical power would decrease.

Explanation: The statistical power of a test is the probability that the test will correctly reject the null hypothesis when it is false. In this context, the null hypothesis is that the screening test is no better than chance at detecting the disease. The power of the test is influenced by several factors, including the sample size, the effect size (the difference between the true value and the null hypothesis value), the significance level (alpha), and the variability of the data.

In the given scenario, the power of the test is not directly provided, but we can infer that the sensitivity and specificity of the screening test are important factors that affect its power. Sensitivity is the proportion of true positives that are correctly identified by the test, while specificity is the proportion of true negatives that are correctly identified by the test.

If the sensitivity of the screening test were decreased, it would mean that fewer true positives would be correctly identified, leading to a higher number of false negatives. This would reduce the power of the test to detect the disease, as the test would be less likely to correctly reject the null hypothesis that it is no better than chance at detecting the disease. Therefore, option E is the correct answer.

Option A is incorrect because the statistical power of a test cannot be compared to the gold standard. The gold standard is a reference test that is used to determine the true status of the disease, and it does not have a statistical power.

Option B is incorrect because repeating the study with a larger sample size or a different study design could increase the statistical power of the screening test.

Option C is incorrect because the power of the test cannot be calculated from the given information. The power of the test would require additional information, such as the sample size, the effect size, the significance level, and the variability of the data.

Option D is incorrect because increasing the specificity of the screening test would not necessarily increase the statistical power of the test. While increasing specificity would reduce the number of false positives, it would not necessarily increase the number of true positives, which is a more important factor in determining the power of the test.",Success
"A 25-year-old woman presents to her new family physician for a follow-up appointment. She previously presented with itching, as well as frequent and painful urination. A vaginal swab was taken and sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. Diplococci were seen on Gram stain and were grown on Thayer-Martin agar. When discussing her infection, the patient says that she uses safe sex practices. Her history is significant for meningitis and for infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The physician discusses that the reason behind these infections comes from a defect in the innate immune system. Which of the following best describes the component that is likely deficient in this patient?",D,"Correct Answer is: A, Acts as an important opsonin

The patient's history of meningitis and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, along with her current sexually transmitted infection, suggests a possible defect in her innate immune system. The description of the component that is likely deficient in this patient is one that acts as an important opsonin. Opsonins are molecules that coat pathogens and enhance their recognition and phagocytosis by immune cells. This function is critical in the innate immune response to infections, including those caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.

"A 36-year-old man presents to a physician after having a transient loss of consciousness while resting after dinner the previous night. His symptoms only lasted for a few seconds and resolved spontaneously. This is the third time he experienced such an episode. He says that he recently started having nightmares. His father died of sudden cardiac death at the age of 45 years without a history of hypertension or any chronic cardiac disorder. A complete physical examination was normal. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevations in V1, V2, and V3, and the presence of incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB). After a complete diagnostic evaluation, Brugada syndrome was diagnosed. He has prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers. The drug also blocks potassium channels and prolongs action potential duration, but it does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. The drug also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity. If taken in high doses, which of the following are the most likely side effects of the drug?",A,"Correct Answer is: D, Pedal edema and flushing

The description of the drug given in the question suggests that it is a class I anti-arrhythmic drug with sodium channel blocking properties, which also blocks potassium channels and has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity. Based on these properties, the drug is most likely a type of class IC anti-arrhythmic, such as flecainide or propafenone. However, the side effects listed in the options do not perfectly match any single drug. Among the given options, the side effects of pedal edema and flushing are most consistent with the alpha-blocking activity of the drug, which can lead to vasodilation and fluid retention. This is not a specific side effect of any one class I anti-arrhythmic, but it is a known side effect of drugs with alpha-blocking activity.",Success

"A 69-year-old male with a longstanding history of hypertension and high cholesterol presents with abdominal pain and ‘bruising on his feet’. The patient states that his symptoms started about a week ago and have steadily worsened. He describes the abdominal pain as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air.

Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm). High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are initiated. Morphine sulfate and metoprolol are administered. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?
 ",E,"Correct Answer is: C, Elective endovascular repair

This patient has a small, unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a diameter of 4.1 cm, which is above the generally accepted threshold for intervention (usually around 5.5 cm for men). However, given his history of hypertension, high cholesterol, smoking, heavy alcohol use, and previous transient ischemic attacks, he is at higher risk for aneurysm growth and rupture. The presence of abdominal pain and bruising on his feet, which could indicate a leaking aneurysm or other vascular compromise, further elevates his risk. Elective endovascular repair is often preferred for smaller aneurysms when the anatomy is suitable, as it is associated with lower perioperative morbidity and mortality compared to open surgical repair. Emergency open surgical repair is not indicated since the aneurysm is not ruptured, and elective open surgical repair is typically reserved for larger aneurysms or when endovascular repair is not feasible. Discharging the patient with surveillance alone would be inappropriate given his high risk factors and symptoms.",Success

A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of a tingling sensation in his right forearm. He reports that his symptoms started after he lifted heavy weights at the gym. Physical examination shows loss of sensation on the lateral side of the right forearm. Sensation over the thumb is intact. Range of motion of the neck is normal. His symptoms do not worsen with axial compression or distraction of the neck. Further examination of this patient is most likely to show weakness of which of the following actions?,B,"Correct Answer is: D, Index finger flexion

The patient's symptoms of a tingling sensation in the right forearm, with loss of sensation on the lateral side and intact sensation over the thumb, suggest involvement of the radial nerve or one of its branches. The radial nerve innervates the extensor muscles of the forearm, including those responsible for wrist extension and finger extension. However, the specific reference to weakness in one of the options points to a more localized deficit. Among the options provided, index finger flexion is not directly controlled by the radial nerve but by the median nerve. However, the context of the question and the options provided suggest that the question is testing knowledge of nerve distributions in the arm and forearm. Since the symptoms are localized to the lateral forearm and do not include the thumb, which is innervated by the radial nerve, the weakness would most likely affect muscles innervated by other nerves that could be secondarily affected in a complex nerve injury scenario. Given the options, index finger flexion (option D) is controlled by the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve, which could potentially be affected in a complex nerve injury or entrapment scenario involving the arm or forearm, although this is not the typical presentation for an isolated radial nerve issue as described.",Success
"A 30-year-old woman presents to your office with decreased appetite, malaise, and fever. Serologic tests reveal positive Anti-HBsAg and Anti-HAV IgM antibodies. Which of the following is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, Shellfish

Explanation: The patient's positive Anti-HBsAg and Anti-HAV IgM antibodies indicate that she has been exposed to both Hepatitis B and Hepatitis A viruses. However, the most likely cause of her acute symptoms, including decreased appetite, malaise, and fever, is Hepatitis A, which is often transmitted through the fecal-oral route, commonly associated with contaminated food, particularly shellfish. Hepatitis B is also a possibility, but the acute presentation and the presence of Anti-HAV IgM antibodies point more strongly to Hepatitis A as the cause.",Success

"A 2-year-old boy in respiratory distress is brought to the emergency department by his parents. They state that approximately one hour after putting their child to sleep, a ""hacking"" cough was heard from his bedroom. After entering his room the parents state their child appeared to be in distress, making a high pitched noise with every breath. Beyond a runny nose for the past few days, the child has been healthy. He has no toys in his bed or access to any other small objects. Physical exam demonstrates a 2-year-old child in respiratory distress.

Which of the following choices is the proper management for this patient?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, Dexamethasome, racemic epinephrine and observation for 4 hours; discharge if stridor remits

The high-pitched noise with every breath and the ""hacking"" cough suggest that the child is experiencing stridor, which is a sign of upper airway obstruction. Given the child's recent runny nose and the absence of small objects that could be inhaled, the most likely cause of the stridor is viral croup. The treatment for viral croup includes dexamethasone to reduce inflammation and racemic epinephrine to provide immediate relief of airway swelling. Observation for 4 hours is necessary to ensure that the stridor remits before discharging the patient.",Success

The physician suspects that the patient is suffering from a chronic lung infection. Which of the following statements best describes the type of lung inflammation in this patient?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, It consists of a largely circumscribed granuloma with epithelioid cells with Langhans cells.

The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with a chronic lung infection, most likely tuberculosis (TB). The presence of granulomas with epithelioid cells and Langhans cells is characteristic of the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of TB. The patient's weight loss, fever, night sweats, and productive cough with blood-tinged sputum are all common symptoms of active TB. The consolidation in the apical part of the right lung on the chest radiograph is also typical of TB. The high white blood cell count and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are nonspecific findings but are consistent with an inflammatory process. The differential count shows a relative lymphocytosis and eosinophilia, which can be seen in TB but are not specific for the diagnosis. The presence of granulomas with epithelioid cells and Langhans cells is the most specific finding for TB among the options provided.",Success
"A 16-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath after prolonged exposure to cold air during a recent hike with his friends. He informs the physician that he is asthmatic, but does not use inhalers regularly because he does not like using medications. He is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol. On physical examination, the temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the pulse is 120/min, the blood pressure is 114/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 32/min. Auscultation of the chest reveals bilateral wheezing. The physician asks the nurse to administer nebulized albuterol; however, the boy declines nebulized albuterol because of a history of palpitations that he experienced previously. The physician then prescribes nebulized ipratropium bromide, which results in significant clinical improvement. Which of the following second messenger systems is affected by the drug that improved the boy's symptoms?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Phosphoinositol system

Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic bronchodilator that acts by blocking muscarinic receptors, which are G-protein coupled receptors. When these receptors are activated, they stimulate the phosphoinositol system, leading to an increase in intracellular calcium levels and subsequent bronchoconstriction. By blocking these receptors, ipratropium bromide prevents the activation of the phosphoinositol system and reduces bronchoconstriction, thereby improving the patient's symptoms.",Success

Further discussion reveals that the patient was using sodium fluoroacetate as a pesticide, which is known to form fluorocitrate in the cells of aerobic organisms. Which of the following substances will accumulate in the patient’s cells?",B,"Correct Answer is: E, Succinate

The patient's symptoms and the use of sodium fluoroacetate as a pesticide point to a diagnosis of fluoroacetate poisoning. Fluoroacetate is metabolized to fluorocitrate, which is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme aconitase, a key enzyme in the Krebs cycle. This inhibition leads to the accumulation of succinate, as the conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate is blocked, and the Krebs cycle is halted at this point. The accumulation of succinate can lead to a decrease in ATP production, which can result in the symptoms observed in the patient.",Success

"A 68-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a cough, dyspnea, and fever for 1 day. The cough is productive of small amounts of green phlegm. He has metastatic colon cancer and has received three cycles of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin; his last chemotherapy session was 2.5 months ago. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has been treated with antibiotics and prednisolone for acute exacerbations three times in the past year. His medications include a fluticasone-salmeterol inhaler and a tiotropium bromide inhaler. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 48 years. His temperature is 39.1°C (103.1°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 88/69 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. Pulmonary examination shows diffuse crackles and rhonchi. An x-ray of the chest shows a left upper-lobe infiltrate of the lung. Two sets of blood cultures are obtained. Endotracheal aspirate Gram stain shows gram-negative rods. Two large bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluids are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",D,"Correct Answer is: A, Ceftriaxone and azithromycin

The patient presents with symptoms of pneumonia, including cough, dyspnea, fever, and green phlegm. The chest x-ray shows a left upper-lobe infiltrate, which is consistent with pneumonia. The patient has several risk factors for severe pneumonia, including his age, history of smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and recent chemotherapy for metastatic colon cancer. The Gram stain of the endotracheal aspirate shows gram-negative rods, which suggests that the infection may be caused by a gram-negative organism.

Option A, ceftriaxone and azithromycin, is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient. Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that is active against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. It is often used to treat community-acquired pneumonia, including pneumonia caused by gram-negative organisms. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is active against a wide range of bacteria, including atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma and Chlamydia. It is often used in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic to provide broader coverage for community-acquired pneumonia.

Option B, ertapenem, is a carbapenem antibiotic that is active against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. It is often used to treat severe infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms. However, it is not typically used as first-line therapy for community-acquired pneumonia.

Option C, colistin, is a polymyxin antibiotic that is active against multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms. It is often used as a last resort for treating infections caused by these organisms. However, it is not typically used as first-line therapy for community-acquired pneumonia.

Option D, cefepime and levofloxacin, is a combination of a fourth-generation cephalosporin and a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. This combination provides broad coverage for both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including multidrug-resistant organisms. However, it is not typically used as first-line therapy for community-acquired pneumonia.

Option E, clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate, is a combination of a macrolide antibiotic and a beta-lactam antibiotic with beta-lactamase inhibition. This combination is often used to treat community-acquired pneumonia caused by atypical bacteria, such as Mycoplasma and Chlamydia. However, it may not provide adequate coverage for gram-negative organisms, which are a likely cause of this patient's pneumonia.",Success

"Mutations in the ATP2A1 gene results in loss of function of the calcium ATPase pump, which is in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes of skeletal muscle in humans. This mutation results in a rare disease characterized by muscle cramping and stiffening that is usually most severe after exercise or strenuous activity and is typically relieved after affected individuals rest for a few minutes. Which of the following is expected in individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation?",B,"Correct Answer is: B, Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased

Explanation: The ATP2A1 gene encodes for the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump, which is responsible for pumping calcium ions from the cytosol back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum during muscle relaxation. A loss of function mutation in the ATP2A1 gene would result in a decrease in the efficiency of the SERCA pump, leading to a slower rate of calcium ion sequestration and thus a slower muscle relaxation time. Additionally, the decreased efficiency of the SERCA pump would result in a higher cytosolic calcium concentration, which would lead to prolonged muscle contraction and cramping. Therefore, the correct answer is B, muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased.",Success

The patient is immediately started on a bolus of intravenous (IV) 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl). Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",D,"Correct Answer is: C, Start IV insulin infusion

This patient presents with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The high blood glucose level, presence of ketones in the urine, and the acidotic blood gas results are all indicative of DKA. The initial management of DKA includes fluid resuscitation with isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl), which has already been started. The next best step is to begin an insulin infusion to lower blood glucose levels and correct the metabolic acidosis. Insulin therapy will also help to reduce the production of ketones and improve the utilization of glucose by the body's cells. Once the patient's blood glucose level is below 250 mg/dL, the IV fluid can be switched to 5% dextrose to prevent hypoglycemia. Potassium replacement should be initiated once the patient's urine output is adequate and the serum potassium level is below 5 mEq/L. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is not typically used in the management of DKA, as it can worsen the underlying metabolic abnormalities and lead to other complications.",Success

""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

The patient is prepared for emergency neurosurgery. Which of the following anesthesia medications would be the best option for this patient?",A,"Correct Answer is: A, Propofol

Explanation: In this scenario, the patient has sustained significant head trauma and is unresponsive with a fixed and dilated pupil, indicating increased intracranial pressure (ICP). Propofol is often the preferred anesthetic agent in such cases due to its cerebral protective effects, including a decrease in cerebral metabolic rate and cerebral blood flow, which can help to reduce ICP. Additionally, propofol has a rapid onset of action and a short duration of effect, making it suitable for emergency situations where rapid induction of anesthesia is required.",Success
"A 25-year-old female presents to urgent care with complaints of one day of burning and pain with urination, urgency, and frequency. She denies having a fever but has experienced intermittent chills. She is sexually active and inconsistently uses condoms. The patient has no past medical history. She is allergic to sulfa drugs. Physical examination of the genitalia is normal. Urinalysis shows positive leukocyte esterase and nitrites. The urine culture demonstrates gram-negative rods that form pink colonies on MacConkey agar. She is treated with an antibiotic and her symptoms quickly improve. The mechanism of the antibiotic she was most likely treated with is which of the following?",A,"Correct Answer is: A, Inhibits cell wall synthesis

The patient's symptoms and urinalysis findings are consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by a gram-negative rod, which is likely Escherichia coli (E. coli). The antibiotic that is commonly used to treat UTIs caused by gram-negative rods is a fluoroquinolone, such as ciprofloxacin, or an aminoglycoside, such as gentamicin. However, since the patient is allergic to sulfa drugs, it is important to avoid cross-reactivity with other sulfonamide antibiotics. The mechanism of action of fluoroquinolones is to inhibit DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are essential for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, and repair. However, the closest mechanism of action listed in the options is A, which refers to the mechanism of action of beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, which inhibit cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and preventing the cross-linking of peptidoglycan strands in the bacterial cell wall. Therefore, the most likely antibiotic that was used to treat this patient's UTI is a fluoroquinolone, which inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, but the closest option is A, which refers to the mechanism of action of beta-lactam antibiotics.",Success

She has also had pain in her proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints for several years and reports that this pain is worse in the morning but improves over the day. The cells that are present in this patient's DIP joints and PIP joints are analyzed and compared. Which of the following is most likely to be true about this patient's findings?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, DIP has more neutrophils and fewer monocytes than PIP

The patient's history of pain in her PIP and MCP joints for several years, which is worse in the morning but improves over the day, is consistent with rheumatoid arthritis. The recent laceration over her DIP joints, which have become red and swollen, is likely due to an acute inflammatory response to the injury. Neutrophils are typically the first cells to arrive at the site of injury or infection, and they are responsible for phagocytosing and destroying invading pathogens. Monocytes, on the other hand, are typically involved in the later stages of inflammation and are responsible for phagocytosing debris and dead cells. Therefore, it is likely that the DIP joints have more neutrophils and fewer monocytes than the PIP joints, which have been affected by chronic inflammation due to rheumatoid arthritis.",Success

Which of the following is the best explanation for this patient’s laboratory values?",A,"Correct Answer is: C, Increased renal clearance

The patient's laboratory values show a normal hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocyte count, platelet count, and INR. His serum electrolytes are also within normal limits, as are his glucose and calcium levels. The only slightly abnormal values are his blood pressure and his BUN and creatinine levels, which are slightly elevated. However, these values are not significantly abnormal and could be explained by his history of hypertension and diabetes.

The patient's recent switch to an all-vegetarian diet could potentially affect his laboratory values, but the values shown are not indicative of any specific dietary deficiencies or excesses. The slightly elevated BUN and creatinine levels could be explained by increased renal clearance, which could be due to the patient's hypertension and diabetes, or could be a normal variation. Without further information, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of these slightly elevated values, but increased renal clearance is the most likely explanation given the patient's medical history and laboratory values.",Success

Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the distal lower extremities. Patellar reflexes are absent bilaterally. His gait is unsteady and broad-based. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications?",E,"Correct Answer is: E, Thoracic aortic aneurysm

The patient's history of a painless ulcer on his penis that resolved without treatment twenty years ago suggests a past history of syphilis. The symptoms he is currently experiencing, including sharp, shooting pain in both legs, small pupils that constrict with accommodation but do not react to light, decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch over the distal lower extremities, absent patellar reflexes bilaterally, and an unsteady and broad-based gait, are consistent with late syphilis, specifically neurosyphilis.

Late syphilis can affect the cardiovascular system, leading to complications such as a thoracic aortic aneurysm. A syphilitic aortic aneurysm is a weakening and bulging of the wall of the aorta, the main artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. If left untreated, an aortic aneurysm can rupture, leading to a medical emergency and potentially fatal bleeding.

The other options listed are not directly related to the complications of syphilis or the patient's symptoms. Atrioventricular block and mitral valve regurgitation are cardiac conditions, but they are not typically associated with syphilis. Penile squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can occur in the penis, but it is not a complication of syphilis. Inflammatory polyarthritis is a type of arthritis characterized by inflammation of the joints, but it is not a complication of syphilis.",Success

On Valsalva and standing, the cervix descents to the plane of the hymen. The uterus is not enlarged and the ovaries are non-palpable. Which of the following treatments is most reasonable to offer this patient?",A,"Correct Answer is: A, Support pessary

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with uterine prolapse, which is the descent of the uterus into the vagina. A support pessary is a reasonable first-line treatment for uterine prolapse, particularly in patients who are symptomatic but do not have urinary or fecal incontinence. It can help to provide support to the prolapsed uterus and alleviate symptoms such as the feeling of a foreign body in the vagina. Estrogen therapy may be considered in postmenopausal women with atrophic changes, but it is not the first-line treatment for uterine prolapse. Space-filling pessaries are used for vaginal vault prolapse, not uterine prolapse. Posterior colporrhaphy and sacral colpopexy are surgical options for more severe cases of uterine prolapse that do not respond to conservative management.",Success

A chest X-ray is taken. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows no significant findings. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s physical and diagnostic findings?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, Parasitic infection

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest heart failure, which can be caused by various factors. Among the given options, a parasitic infection is the most likely explanation given the patient's history of emigration from Mexico and visits to his hometown, where he may have been exposed to parasitic infections that can affect the heart, such as Chagas disease. Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is transmitted by the bite of the triatomine bug. It can lead to chronic heart disease, including dilated cardiomyopathy, which can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, palpitations, and edema. The other options do not fit the patient's presentation as well. Alcohol abuse and bacterial infection do not explain the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms, and myocardial infarction would likely have shown up on the ECG. Hypertensive changes could contribute to heart failure, but the patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, making this a less likely explanation.",Success

"A 41-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a suicide attempt. His wife found him on the bathroom floor with an empty bottle of medication next to him. He has a history of major depressive disorder. His only medication is nortriptyline. His pulse is 127/min and blood pressure is 90/61 mm Hg. Examination shows dilated pupils and dry skin. The abdomen is distended and there is dullness on percussion in the suprapubic region. An ECG shows tachycardia and a QRS complex width of 130 ms. In addition to intravenous fluid resuscitation, which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",E,"Correct Answer is: C, Cyproheptadine

Rationale: The patient's symptoms (dilated pupils, dry skin, tachycardia, and a widened QRS complex on ECG) are consistent with anticholinergic toxicity, which is expected in an overdose of tricyclic antidepressants like nortriptyline. Cyproheptadine is an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties that can be used to treat anticholinergic toxicity by competing with the excess anticholinergic agents for receptor sites. Atropine is also an anticholinergic and would exacerbate the toxicity. Naloxone is used for opioid toxicity. Ammonium chloride is used to treat metabolic alkalosis, and sodium bicarbonate is used to treat metabolic acidosis, neither of which are relevant to this case.",Success
"A 23-year-old woman presents to the hospital for elective surgery. However, due to an unexpected bleeding event, the physician had to order a blood transfusion to replace the blood lost in the surgery. After this, the patient became irritable and had difficulty breathing, suggesting an allergic reaction, which was immediately treated with epinephrine. This patient is otherwise healthy, and her history does not indicate any health conditions or known allergies. The physician suspects an immunodeficiency disorder that was not previously diagnosed. If serum is taken from this patient to analyze her condition further, which of the following would be expected?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, Low IgA, normal IgG, and IgM

The patient's reaction to the blood transfusion and her previously undiagnosed immunodeficiency disorder suggest a possible selective IgA deficiency. Selective IgA deficiency is the most common primary immunodeficiency disorder, characterized by low levels of IgA in the serum, while IgG and IgM levels are typically normal. This condition can increase the risk of allergic reactions to blood transfusions due to the presence of anti-IgA antibodies in the patient's serum that can react with IgA in the transfused blood products.",Success

"A 42-year-old man comes to the physician to establish care. He recently moved to the area and has not been to a primary care physician for over 5 years. He has no history of serious illness, but has intermittent bilateral knee pain for which he takes 650 mg acetaminophen every other day. He is married with three children and is sexually active with his wife. During the past 10 years, he has unsuccessfully tried to lose weight. He has smoked one half pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. About 2–3 times per week he has 1–2 glasses of wine with dinner. He is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 93 kg (205 lb); BMI is 36.3 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. On abdominal examination, the liver is palpated 2 to 3 cm below the right costal margin. Laboratory studies show:

Transabdominal ultrasonography shows a mildly enlarged, diffusely hyperechoic liver. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these liver abnormalities?""",C,"Correct Answer is: C, Insulin resistance

The patient's BMI of 36.3 kg/m2 indicates obesity, and his intermittent knee pain, along with his unsuccessful attempts to lose weight over the past 10 years, suggest that he may have underlying insulin resistance. The laboratory studies show an elevated hemoglobin A1c of 6.3%, which is indicative of prediabetes, further supporting the diagnosis of insulin resistance. The mildly enlarged, diffusely hyperechoic liver on ultrasonography is consistent with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is commonly associated with insulin resistance and obesity. The other options are less likely given the patient's history and laboratory findings.",Success
"A 16-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance from a soccer game. During the game, he was about to kick the ball when another player collided with his leg from the front. He was unable to stand up after this collision and reported severe knee pain. On presentation, he was found to have a mild knee effusion. Physical exam showed that his knee could be pushed posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion but it could not be pulled anteriorly in the same position. The anatomic structure that was most likely injured in this patient has which of the following characteristics?",E,"Correct Answer is: E, Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle

The patient's injury is consistent with a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury, which runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle. The mechanism of injury, where the knee is pushed posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion, is typical for a PCL injury. The inability to pull the knee anteriorly in the same position is also indicative of a PCL injury, as this would be the normal function of the PCL to prevent the tibia from moving too far forward relative to the femur.",Success
"A 64-year-old male with a past medical history of two myocardial infarctions presents to the emergency room with shortness of breath. He notes that he stopped taking his furosemide two weeks prior, because he ran out of pills. On exam, his oxygen saturation is 78%, his lungs have crackles throughout, and jugular venous pulsation is located at the earlobe. EKG and troponin levels are normal. Which of the following is consistent with this man's pulmonary physiology?",E,"Correct Answer is: E, Increased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with pulmonary edema, which is a complication of congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's history of myocardial infarctions and stopping his furosemide (a diuretic used to manage CHF) two weeks prior are risk factors for the development of CHF. The decreased oxygen saturation, crackles in the lungs, and jugular venous pulsation at the earlobe are all signs of CHF. The Aa gradient (alveolar-arterial gradient) is a measure of the difference in oxygen concentration between the alveoli and the arterial blood. An increased Aa gradient indicates a problem with oxygen diffusion, which can occur in pulmonary edema due to the decreased surface area for diffusion and increased diffusion distance caused by the accumulation of fluid in the alveoli.",Success
"A 50-year-old man presents to the office with complaints of fever and chills for 4 weeks. He adds that he is fatigued all the time and has generalized weakness. He has drenching night sweats and has had 2 episodes of non-bilious vomiting over the past few days. He traveled to the Netherlands for 4 days a month ago.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 40 mm/h
An excisional biopsy of one of the cervical lymph nodes is performed. The histopathologic analysis is shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"Correct Answer is: C, HIV lymphadenopathy

The patient's history of HIV infection, the presence of multiple non-tender lymph nodes, and the lack of other symptoms such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss, which are often associated with malignancies or infections, point towards HIV lymphadenopathy. The histopathologic analysis would typically show reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, which is common in HIV-infected patients due to chronic immune activation. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation as well: Acute lymphoid leukemia would likely present with more systemic symptoms and abnormal blood counts; classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma would often be associated with B symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss) and a different pattern of lymph node involvement; mononucleosis would typically present with fever, pharyngitis, and atypical lymphocytes on the blood smear; and phenytoin-induced adenopathy is not a recognized condition.",Success

"A 12-year-old girl is brought to your psychiatry office by her parents, who are concerned that she has not made any friends since starting middle school last year. The girl tells you that she gets nervous around other children, as she cannot tell what they are feeling, when they are joking, or what she has in common with them. Her teachers describe her as “easily distracted” and “easily upset by change.” When asked about her hobbies and interests, she states that “marine biology” is her only interest and gives you a 15-minute unsolicited explanation of how to identify different penguin species. Mental status exam is notable for intense eye contact, flat affect, and concrete thought process. Which of the following is true regarding this child’s disorder?",A,"Correct Answer is: A, Boys are more commonly affected than girls

The description of the 12-year-old girl's symptoms and behaviors is consistent with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), specifically Asperger's Syndrome. Key features of ASD include social communication difficulties, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. While impaired attention and intellectual disability can be present in some individuals with ASD, they are not defining features of the disorder. A family history of schizophrenia is not typically associated with ASD. The typical age of onset for ASD is before the age of 3, but the features may not become fully apparent until social demands exceed the individual's limited capacities, which can occur during adolescence. Boys are indeed more commonly affected by ASD than girls, making option A the correct answer.",Success

Her blood work shows normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin. Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies are also ruled out. A Coombs test is negative. Red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal. The physician determined that these findings are related to an enzyme deficiency. Which of the following allosterically inhibits this enzyme?",A,"Correct Answer is: E, Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. G6PD is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is responsible for producing NADPH to protect red blood cells from oxidative damage. The enzyme deficiency leads to hemolytic anemia, which is evidenced by the normocytic anemia, elevated reticulocyte count, and decreased haptoglobin. The allosteric inhibitor of G6PD is fructose 2,6-bisphosphate.",Success
"A 4-year-old boy presents for a routine checkup. The patient’s parents say he was doing well until a few weeks ago at which time he started to complain of daily abdominal cramps and occasional muscle pains.

"A 62-year-old man presents with episodes of palpitations for the past 3 weeks. He says that he has episodes where he feels his heart is ‘racing and pounding’, lasting 1–2 hours on average. Initially, he says the episodes would happen 1–2 times per week but now happen almost every day. This last episode has been constant for the past 2 days. He denies any seizure, loss of consciousness, dizziness, chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is significant for an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, status post intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with still some residual neurologic impairment, and long-standing gastroesophageal reflux secondary to a hiatal hernia, managed medically. The patient reports a 15-pack-year smoking history, but no alcohol or recreational drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. On physical examination, muscle strength in the lower extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right, along with sensory loss on the left, all of which is improved from his previous exam 3 weeks ago. There is a loss of the left half of the visual field bilaterally which is stable from the previous exam. Cardiac examination is significant for a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm. No rubs, thrills or murmurs. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan shows evidence of an area of infarction in the vicinity of the right anterior cerebral artery showing normal interval change with no evidence of new hemorrhage or expansion of the area of infarction. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed, which is shown in the exhibit (see image below). Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) in this patient?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Begin warfarin and heparin

The patient's presentation of palpitations, irregular rate and rhythm on ECG, and history of ischemic stroke suggest the presence of atrial fibrillation, which is a common cause of stroke. Anticoagulation with warfarin and heparin is the most appropriate intervention to prevent future cerebrovascular accidents in this patient. Aspirin and clopidogrel are antiplatelet agents and are not as effective as anticoagulants in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Carotid endarterectomy is not indicated in this case as the stroke was due to a cerebral artery infarction, not carotid artery stenosis.",Success
"In 2005, a group of researchers believed that prophylactically removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) in BRCA-mutation positive women would reduce the chance that they developed breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, they reviewed a database of women who were known to be BRCA-mutation positive and divided the group into those with breast cancer and those without breast cancer. They used data in the registry and surveys about peoples’ surgical history to compare the proportion of each population that had undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Based on this data, they reported that women undergoing the procedure had a lower chance of developing breast cancer later in life with an odds ratio of 0.46. This is an example of what type of study design?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Case-control",Success

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",D,"Correct Answer is: E, Hemophilia A

The patient's presentation of bruising on his torso and limbs, along with petechiae, and a prolonged aPTT suggests a coagulation disorder. The normal PT and normal complete blood count rule out some other possibilities, such as vitamin K deficiency or thrombocytopenia. Hemophilia A is the most common inherited bleeding disorder and is caused by a deficiency in factor VIII, which is part of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and would result in a prolonged aPTT.",Success
"A 31-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-week history of a painless lump near the left wrist and tingling pain over his left hand. Physical examination shows a transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist. There is decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand. The tingling pain is aggravated by tapping over the swelling. Which of the following adjacent structures is at risk of entrapment if this mass persists?",C,"Correct Answer is: E, Ulnar nerve

However, based on the symptoms and location of the mass, the structure at risk of entrapment is more likely the Median nerve, which is not listed as an option. The symptoms of decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger, and the aggravation of tingling pain by tapping over the swelling, are more consistent with carpal tunnel syndrome, which is caused by compression of the median nerve at the wrist. Therefore, the correct answer should be a choice that is not provided in the options, but the closest choice would be the Ulnar nerve, which is also at risk of compression in the wrist area, although the symptoms described do not match those of ulnar nerve compression.

The enlarged spleen and the laboratory findings of a low hemoglobin concentration, high mean corpuscular volume, and high reticulocyte count are consistent with megaloblastic anemia, which can be caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 injections would be the most appropriate treatment to prevent the patient's oropharyngeal symptoms.",Success
An experimental new drug in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 was found to increase the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation at the endothelium. This further increased glucose-dependent insulin production. Which of the following drugs has a mechanism of action most similar to this new experimental drug?,B,"Correct Answer is: B, Sitagliptin

Explanation: Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor that prevents the degradation of incretins, leading to increased glucose-dependent insulin production. This mechanism of action is most similar to the experimental drug described in the question. Exenatide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that also increases insulin production but does so by directly stimulating the beta cells of the pancreas. Glimepiride is a sulfonylurea that stimulates insulin production by binding to beta cells and causing them to release insulin. Canagliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor that reduces blood glucose by increasing urinary glucose excretion. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.",Success
"A 60-year-old man with severe persistent asthma since the age of 14 presents with an acute exacerbation of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing over the last several days. His asthmatic symptoms are usually well controlled with regular high-dose inhaled triamcinolone, but over the last week or so he has developed a nocturnal cough and mild wheezing despite good compliance with controller medications. A review of several spirometry reports suggest of bronchial asthma with a partial irreversible airway obstruction. Which of the following is most likely to be associated with the recent loss of asthma control in this patient?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, Airway remodeling

In this case, the patient has a history of severe persistent asthma and has experienced an acute exacerbation of symptoms, including shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. The spirometry reports suggest bronchial asthma with a partial irreversible airway obstruction. This finding is most consistent with airway remodeling, which is a characteristic feature of severe asthma and can lead to a loss of asthma control. Airway remodeling involves structural changes in the airways, such as thickening of the airway walls, increased smooth muscle mass, and alterations in the extracellular matrix, which can result in a partial irreversible airway obstruction and contribute to the worsening of asthma symptoms.",Success

An investigator is studying the function of different enzymes in various human cell types. A subset of normal human cells with an elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase is harvested and isolated. Which of the following is most likely to be absent in these cells?,A,"Correct Answer is: B, Pyruvate kinase

Bisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme that is involved in the glycolytic pathway, specifically in the conversion of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Pyruvate kinase is another enzyme in the glycolytic pathway that catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. If the cells have an elevated concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase, it suggests that they have an active glycolytic pathway. However, if pyruvate kinase is absent, the glycolytic pathway would be interrupted, and the cells would not be able to produce pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate. This would lead to a buildup of phosphoenolpyruvate and a decrease in the production of ATP, which is essential for cellular function. Therefore, the absence of pyruvate kinase is the most likely option given the information provided.",Success

The patient's symptoms and the context provided suggest that she may have a condition known as Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by excessive production of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. The symptoms mentioned, such as close encounters with other cars, intermittent headaches, and unexpected wetness of shirts (which could indicate excessive sweating or a symptom of a stress response), can be associated with Cushing's syndrome. However, the question specifically asks about a change associated with the physiologic function of the most likely substance in this case.

The options given are related to other hormones, not cortisol. However, among the options, an increase in progesterone (Option E) can be indirectly associated with the physiologic function of cortisol in this context. Cushing's syndrome can lead to menstrual irregularities and infertility in women due to its effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. This can result in changes in the levels of reproductive hormones, including progesterone. While the direct cause of increased progesterone is not Cushing's syndrome, the hormonal imbalance caused by excessive cortisol can lead to changes in progesterone levels.",Success

"A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with a fever. She developed worsening malaise and diaphoresis over the past 48 hours. Her maximum temperature was 102°F (38.9°C) taken the night before presentation. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder, obesity, fibromyalgia, and severe tension headaches. She previously took paroxetine for a 2-month trial but switched to citalopram 6 months ago as she did not feel like paroxetine was adequately helping her symptoms. Her mood has been stable on her current dose of citalopram. She takes ibuprofen for her headaches but previously borrowed a friend’s headache medication when her headaches became very severe. Of note, she has been trying to lose weight and recently started taking an amino acid supplement at the suggestion of her nephew who is a nutritionist. She is also trying out a new low-carbohydrate diet. She works as a nurse at a local primary care clinic. Her temperature is 101.5°F (38.6°C), blood pressure is 144/80 mmHg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 22/min. She is diaphoretic and shivering. Patellar and brachioradialis reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Tone is increased in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Rapid dorsiflexion of her right ankle elicits 3 beats of clonus. Pupils are equally round and reactive to light. A basic metabolic panel is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely inciting factor for this patient’s condition?",B,"Correct Answer is: B, Increased tryptophan intake

The patient's symptoms of fever, diaphoresis, and shivering, along with her increased muscle tone and clonus, suggest a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. This condition is caused by an excess of serotonin in the body, which can occur when taking certain medications that increase serotonin levels, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like citalopram. The patient's recent change from paroxetine to citalopram is not the most likely inciting factor since she has been on citalopram for 6 months. The most likely inciting factor is the amino acid supplement she recently started taking, which could contain high levels of tryptophan, an amino acid that is a precursor to serotonin. The low-carbohydrate diet could also contribute to the condition by increasing the bioavailability of tryptophan in the brain. The other options listed (decreased carbohydrate intake, surreptitious diuretic abuse, and surreptitious opiate abuse) are not likely to cause serotonin syndrome.",Success

Group 1, the study treatment group, is given drug A, while group 2, the control group, is given the current standard antifungal therapy. After the completion of therapy, 190 participants from the study treatment group and 165 participants from the control group are cured. Which calculation below represents the number needed to treat for the new drug?",B,"The number needed to treat (NNT) is a measure used in clinical trials to indicate how many patients need to be treated with the new therapy rather than the standard therapy for one additional patient to benefit. It is calculated by taking the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (ARR). The ARR is the difference in the event rate between the treatment group and the control group.

In this case, the event is being cured. The event rate in the treatment group is 190/250, and the event rate in the control group is 165/250. The ARR is:

ARR = (190/250) - (165/250) = 25/250

On physical exam, he is found to be anxious but does not have any visible injuries other than the lacerations. Which of the following processes would most likely be seen in this patient?",E,"Correct Answer is: E, Increased norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node

Explanation: The patient in this scenario is experiencing a traumatic event and is likely to have an increased sympathetic response, which would lead to increased norepinephrine release. This would cause an increase in heart rate and contractility, as well as vasoconstriction, in order to maintain blood pressure and perfusion to vital organs. The increased norepinephrine would also stimulate the sinoatrial node, leading to an increased heart rate. The other options listed are not as likely to occur in this scenario. Baroreceptor-mediated vasodilation would occur in response to high blood pressure, which is not present in this patient. Chemoreceptor-mediated vasoconstriction would occur in response to low blood oxygen levels or high carbon dioxide levels, which are not mentioned in the scenario. Increased acetylcholine at the sinoatrial node would lead to a decreased heart rate, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation. Increased atrial natriuretic peptide release would occur in response to increased blood volume or pressure, which is not mentioned in the scenario.",Success

"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia.

On physical exam, you notice a gravid uterus 10 cm above the pubic symphysis. The patient's external genitalia appear within normal limits. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",B,"Correct Answer is: E, Regular follow up appointments

At 10 weeks gestation, the next best step in management for a healthy, low-risk pregnant woman is to schedule regular follow-up appointments for prenatal care. This will allow for monitoring of the pregnancy, assessment of fetal development, and early detection of any potential complications. The patient's current symptoms of nausea and vomiting are common during early pregnancy and do not indicate an urgent need for invasive testing such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Cell-free DNA testing can be offered as an option for screening for chromosomal abnormalities, but it is not the immediate next step in management. Iron and vitamin D supplementation may be recommended based on laboratory results, but regular follow-up appointments are the priority.",Success
"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of abdominal distention, fatigue, and night sweats over the past 4 months.

His current medications include lisinopril, metformin, and azithromycin. He has no sign of injury, and he appears well. During the examination, he loses consciousness again. Telemetry shows polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis, which spontaneously resolves after 30 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's syncope?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, Prolonged QT interval

The patient's presentation of syncope following palpitations and the observation of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis (Torsades de Pointes) on telemetry are most consistent with a prolonged QT interval. This can be caused by various factors, including electrolyte abnormalities, genetic conditions, and certain medications. In this case, the patient's medications (lisinopril, metformin, and azithromycin) and his medical conditions (hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and pneumonia) should be reviewed for potential causes of a prolonged QT interval. Azithromycin is known to potentially prolong the QT interval, which could have contributed to the patient's arrhythmia.",Success
"A 56-year-old patient is being treated with oral amoxicillin for community-acquired pneumonia. The plasma clearance of the drug is calculated as 15.0 L/h. Oral bioavailability of the drug is 75%. Sensitivity analysis of a sputum culture shows a minimal inhibitory concentration of 1 μg/mL for the causative pathogen. The target plasma concentration is 2 mg/L. If the drug is administered twice per day, which of the following dosages should be administered at each dosing interval to maintain a steady state?",B,"To determine the appropriate dosage of amoxicillin to be administered at each dosing interval, we need to calculate the dose required to achieve the target plasma concentration while accounting for the drug's clearance, bioavailability, and dosing frequency.

The target plasma concentration is 2 mg/L, and the drug is administered twice per day. The plasma clearance is 15.0 L/h, and the oral bioavailability is 75%.

The formula to calculate the dose required for a steady-state concentration is:
\[ \text{Dose} = \frac{\text{Cl} \times \text{C}}{\text{F} \times \text{d}} \]
where:
- Cl is the clearance,
- C is the target concentration,
- F is the bioavailability, and
- d is the dosing frequency (in terms of the fraction of the 24-hour day between doses).

Given:
- Cl = 15.0 L/h,
- C = 2 mg/L,
- F = 75% = 0.75,
- d = 12 hours (since the drug is administered twice per day, this is \(\frac{12}{24}\) or 0.5).

Plugging the values into the formula:
\[ \text{Dose} = \frac{15.0 \times 2}{0.75 \times 0.5} = \frac{30}{0.375} = 80 \]

However, this calculation gives the dose per hour to maintain the concentration. Since the dose is administered twice per day, we need to calculate the dose per administration:
\[ \text{Dose per administration} = 80 \times 12 = 960 \]

This value is significantly higher than the options provided, suggesting an error in the interpretation or calculation. Given the options provided, let's re-evaluate the formula for the dose per administration directly:

\[ \text{Dose per administration} = \frac{\text{Cl} \times \text{C} \times 24}{\text{F} \times \text{d}} \]

\[ \text{Dose per administration} = \frac{15.0 \times 2 \times 24}{0.75 \times 0.5} = \frac{720}{0.375} = 1920 \]

This calculation also leads to a dose far exceeding the provided options. The discrepancy suggests a potential error in the interpretation of the question or the provided options. However, given the options provided, none of them align with the calculated dose based on the provided formula and values.

Given the options provided, the closest to the calculated dose based on a realistic interpretation of the formula and values would be E. 540 mg, but this is still not a correct dose based on the calculations. The question or the provided options may have an error. 

Therefore, based on the provided options and without further information to correct the discrepancy, the answer cannot be accurately determined from the given data. However, the closest option to the calculated dose is E. 540 mg, but please note that this does not align with the calculations based on the provided formula and values.",Success
"A 5-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office by his parents after they noticed blood in his urine. The child has been complaining of difficulty in passing urine and has lower abdominal pain. He seems more bloated than usual. On some occasions, he starts crying while passing urine, primarily because of a burning sensation. A urinalysis is performed, and the results are as follows:
Urine pH 6.2
Urine specific gravity 1.010
Glucose Negative
Ketones Negative
RBCs 1-2/hpf
WBCs 0-1/hpf
Casts 2-3/hpf
The pediatrician believes the boy has a bladder infection with a double-stranded DNA virus. Which of the following conditions is also commonly associated with this viral infection?",A,"Correct Answer is: D, Vesicular rash

The presence of blood in the urine, difficulty in passing urine, lower abdominal pain, and a burning sensation during urination in a 5-year-old boy suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI). However, the urinalysis results, particularly the low number of red blood cells (RBCs) and white blood cells (WBCs), and the presence of casts, suggest a viral infection rather than a typical bacterial UTI. The reference to a double-stranded DNA virus narrows down the diagnosis to a viral infection that can affect the urinary tract and is associated with vesicular rash.

The most common viral infections that can cause vesicular rash and affect the urinary tract are herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. HSV can cause painful vesicles on the skin, including the genital area, and can lead to viral cystitis, which can present with symptoms similar to those described in the question. Therefore, the correct answer is D, Vesicular rash, which is a common presentation of HSV infection.",Success

He has a 12-year history of hypertension treated with lisinopril. Results of the testing show decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this finding?,C,"Correct Answer is: D, Decreased production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate

Arginine is a substrate for the production of nitric oxide (NO) in vascular endothelial cells. NO then stimulates the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation. A decreased concentration of arginine in vascular endothelial cells would result in decreased production of NO and subsequently decreased production of cGMP, leading to vasoconstriction.",Success

A multi-specialty physician practice is meeting to determine which compensation scheme would best serve the practice and its patient population. Which of the following are true in regards to physician compensation?,C,"Correct Answers are: C, Fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality and E, Capitation may provide perverse incentives to decrease preventive medicine visits.

Explanation:
Option A is incorrect because capitation poses significant financial risk to physicians as they are paid a fixed amount per patient, regardless of the actual cost of care. This means that if the cost of care for patients exceeds the capitated payment, the physician or practice will absorb the loss.
Option B is incorrect because fee-for-service pays physicians for each service they provide, not a set amount of money per unit time for every patient under their care.
Option C is correct because fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality, as they are paid for each service provided. This can lead to overutilization of services and higher healthcare costs.
Option D is incorrect because fee-for-service poses less financial risk to physicians than capitation, as they are paid for each service provided and do not have to absorb the cost of care beyond what they are paid.
Option E is correct because capitation may provide perverse incentives to decrease preventive medicine visits, as physicians are paid a fixed amount per patient and may view preventive care as an unnecessary expense that reduces their profit margin.",Success

Physical exam is notable for a patient with skin that appears yellow/orange. Cardiac, pulmonary, abdominal, and neurological exams are within normal limits. Which of the following is associated with this patient's underlying pathology?",C,"Correct Answer is: B, Decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia, which is indicated by the elevated total and direct bilirubin levels. The yellow/orange discoloration of the skin is a result of the accumulation of bilirubin, a yellow pigment that is a byproduct of the breakdown of red blood cells. The condition is known as jaundice. The increased direct bilirubin suggests that the patient may have a pathology related to the liver's ability to conjugate and excrete bilirubin, such as decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity. This enzyme is responsible for the conjugation of bilirubin, allowing it to be excreted in the bile.",Success

Otherwise she has been healthy with no previous pregnancies. Physical exam reveals galactorrhea and temporal field visual defects. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for this patient's amenorrhea?,B,"Correct Answer is: B, Inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone release

The patient's symptoms of amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and temporal field visual defects, along with her history of headaches, suggest a possible pituitary tumor, specifically a prolactinoma. Prolactinomas can cause elevated prolactin levels, which in turn can inhibit the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. This leads to decreased secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary, resulting in amenorrhea and galactorrhea. The temporal field visual defects are consistent with compression of the optic chiasm by the pituitary tumor.",Success

"A 37-year-old woman presents to your office with heartburn. Following an extensive workup, you diagnose her with a duodenal ulcer secondary to H. pylori infection. You prescribe triple therapy of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of omeprazole?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Inhibition of primary active transport

Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that works by inhibiting the hydrogen-potassium ATPase enzyme system (also known as the proton pump) at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This inhibition is irreversible, leading to a decrease in gastric acid secretion. This mechanism of action is distinct from other acid-reducing medications, such as H2 receptor antagonists, which reversibly block histamine receptors on parietal cells. The inhibition of primary active transport by omeprazole is the correct description of its mechanism of action in reducing gastric acid secretion.",Success

Serum alkaline phosphatase
350 U/L (5.83 μkat/L)
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)

The patient's symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, fever, and right upper quadrant pain, along with the laboratory and imaging findings, suggest acute cholangitis due to a common bile duct stone. The dilated common bile duct and absence of a stone in the gallbladder indicate that the stone is likely in the common bile duct, obstructing bile flow and causing the symptoms. The elevated total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase) are consistent with biliary obstruction. The most appropriate next step in management is urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to remove the stone and relieve the obstruction.

"In a small town with a population of 10,000 people, the prevalence of alcohol use is estimated to be 30%. A study is done with a null hypothesis that there is no association between alcohol use and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The data obtained shows, of the 200 alcoholics who were followed-up, 30 developed GERD; and out of the 400 non-alcoholics, 30 developed GERD. What fraction of GERD can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed in this town?",A,"The fraction of GERD that can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed can be calculated using the population attributable fraction (PAF) formula. The PAF is given by the formula:

PAF = (Ie - In) / Ie

where Ie is the incidence of the disease in the exposed group (alcoholics) and In is the incidence of the disease in the non-exposed group (non-alcoholics).

From the data given:
- 30 out of 200 alcoholics developed GERD, so the incidence in the exposed group (Ie) is 30/200.
- 30 out of 400 non-alcoholics developed GERD, so the incidence in the non-exposed group (In) is 30/400.

Substituting these values into the PAF formula gives:

PAF = [(30/200) - (30/400)] / (30/200)

Simplifying the equation:
PAF = [(30/200) - (15/200)] / (30/200)
PAF = (15/200) / (30/200)
PAF = 15/30
PAF = 0.5 or 1/2

None of the given options directly match the calculated PAF. However, the closest match to the calculation is option D, which represents the ratio of the incidence in alcoholics to the incidence in non-alcoholics, but it is not the exact formula for PAF. The correct answer should be the simplified form of the PAF calculation, which is 1/2 or 0.5, but since this option is not available, the closest representation of the calculation process is:

D. (30/200) / (30/400)

However, the closest correct interpretation would be a rephrased version of option B, stating that ""The chance of observing the association by random chance, assuming the null hypothesis is true, is 3%."" This interpretation reflects the meaning of the p-value, which is the probability of observing the results if the null hypothesis is true. Since the p-value is less than 0.05, it is generally considered statistically significant, indicating that the observed association is unlikely to be due to chance alone.",Success
"A 23-year-old man presents to his primary care physician after bleeding from his gums while brushing his teeth for the past week. Although he has had gum bleeding in the past, it has never been this severe. He has no family history available as he was adopted. He does not have any significant past medical history. His physical exam is within normal limits. Screening lab work is ordered with the following values:
Platelet count 330,000/mm3
Bleeding time 6 mins
Prothrombin time 12 sec
Activated partial thromboplastin time 42 sec
Factor VIII activity decreased
Ristocetin cofactor assay decreased
He is subsequently referred to a hematologist for further work-up and treatment. Which of the following aspects of coagulation would most likely be affected?",B,"Correct Answer is: B, Gp Ib

The patient's presentation and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (vWD), which is characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (vWF). vWF is a large multimeric protein that plays a critical role in primary hemostasis by mediating platelet adhesion to the subendothelial matrix at sites of vascular injury. It also serves as a carrier and stabilizer of factor VIII, which explains the decreased factor VIII activity and Ristocetin cofactor assay in this patient. The bleeding time is prolonged, which is consistent with a defect in primary hemostasis. The normal prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) suggest that the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways are intact. Among the options provided, Gp Ib is the only one that is directly involved in the interaction between platelets and vWF. Gp Ib is a platelet surface receptor that binds to vWF under high shear stress conditions, such as those encountered at sites of vascular injury. Therefore, a defect in Gp Ib would impair the ability of platelets to adhere to vWF and form a stable platelet plug, leading to prolonged bleeding time and increased risk of bleeding, as seen in this patient.",Success
"A 51-year-old Caucasian woman presents to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She had a Colles' fracture 2 years ago. The rest of her past medical history is unremarkable.

"A 33-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 26 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department because of frequent contractions. The contractions last 40 seconds, occur every 2 minutes, and are increasing in intensity. She has a history of recurrent painful ulcers on her vulva, but she currently does not have them. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a non-reassuring fetal heart rate. Her current medications include acyclovir, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate is 88/min, and blood pressure is 126/76 mm Hg. Contractions are felt on the abdomen. The cervix is dilated to 5 cm, 70% effaced, and the station of the head is -2. A fetal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"Correct Answer is: C, Initiate nifedipine therapy

In this case, the patient is experiencing preterm labor at 26 weeks' gestation. The contractions are frequent and increasing in intensity, and the cervix is already dilated to 5 cm with 70% effacement. The most appropriate next step in management is to attempt to stop or slow down the contractions to allow for further gestational development if possible. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that is commonly used to manage preterm labor by relaxing the smooth muscles of the uterus, thus reducing the frequency and intensity of contractions. This can potentially delay delivery and allow for the administration of antenatal corticosteroids to promote fetal lung maturity and transfer to a facility with a neonatal intensive care unit if necessary.",Success
"A 55-year-old man presents with complaints of exertional dyspnea and dry cough. He reports using extra pillows at night to sleep and two nighttime awakenings to catch his breath in the last month. The patient lives in a homeless shelter and has not seen a doctor in the last 20 years. He has been drinking 5-8 drinks of alcohol per day for the last 20 years. Family history is non-significant, and the patient does not take any medications. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.9°F), blood pressure is 135/115 mm Hg, pulse is 85/min, and respiratory rate is 24/min. Physical examination reveals 2+ bilateral pitting edema. Chest auscultation reveals bibasilar crackles. Which of the following is associated with this patient’s condition?",E,"Correct Answer is: E, Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption

The patient's symptoms of exertional dyspnea, dry cough, use of extra pillows to sleep, and nighttime awakenings to catch his breath, along with physical examination findings of bilateral pitting edema and bibasilar crackles, suggest the presence of congestive heart failure. The patient's history of chronic alcohol use and hypertension are risk factors for heart failure. In heart failure, there is a compensatory mechanism to maintain blood pressure and perfusion to vital organs, which leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous system. This results in increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption, contributing to fluid retention and worsening of heart failure symptoms.",Success
"A 22-year-old man presents to the medical clinic after getting bit in the hand by a stray dog 2 days ago. The patient has no past medical history and takes no prescription medications.

The rest of the exam is unremarkable, except that the patient’s face appears to be abnormally long and narrow. The patient is further referred to a geneticist, as he is believed to have a trinucleotide repeat disorder. Which of the following is the most likely inheritance pattern of this disorder?",D,"Correct Answer is: A, Autosomal dominant

The patient's symptoms and physical appearance suggest a trinucleotide repeat disorder, which is often inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that a single copy of the mutated gene from one parent is sufficient to cause the disorder. Fragile X syndrome, which is characterized by delayed speech development, hyperactivity, and a long, narrow face, is an example of a trinucleotide repeat disorder that can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. However, it's important to note that Fragile X syndrome is typically inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern in females and an X-linked recessive pattern in males, but the term ""trinucleotide repeat disorder"" can refer to several different conditions, some of which are autosomal dominant.",Success

Diffuse oozing of the bladder mucosa with neovascularization is seen on cystoscopy. Which of the following could have prevented the patient’s condition?",B,"Correct Answer is: B, Mesna

Mesna (sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate) is a medication that is often used to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis, which is inflammation of the bladder that can lead to blood in the urine (hematuria). This condition can be caused by certain chemotherapy drugs, including cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide. Since the patient in this case developed symptoms of hemorrhagic cystitis (blood in her urine and bladder mucosa oozing with neovascularization), the use of mesna could have potentially prevented her condition if she was taking ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide as part of her immunosuppressive therapy. Mesna works by scavenging the acrolein metabolite of ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide, which is responsible for the bladder toxicity.",Success

"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.

Which of the following statements best describes the cause of this patient’s glucosuria?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules

In diabetic patients, the renal threshold for glucose is exceeded when the plasma glucose concentration is high, leading to glucosuria. The renal threshold for glucose is determined by the capacity of the secondary active transporters (SGLT2) in the proximal renal tubules to reabsorb glucose. When this capacity is exceeded, the excess glucose is excreted in the urine, resulting in glucosuria.

"A 72-year-old man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital for the evaluation of breathlessness and fatigue. His pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Further evaluation shows a systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg × min/L with an end-systolic volume of 80 mL. Which of the following describes the ejection fraction in this patient?",E,"The ejection fraction (EF) is calculated as the stroke volume (SV) divided by the end-diastolic volume (EDV). The stroke volume is the volume of blood pumped out of the left ventricle with each heartbeat, and the end-diastolic volume is the volume of blood in the left ventricle at the end of diastole (when the ventricle is filled). The end-systolic volume (ESV) is the volume of blood remaining in the left ventricle at the end of systole (when the ventricle has just finished contracting).

The question provides the end-systolic volume (ESV) but does not provide the end-diastolic volume (EDV). However, we can calculate the ejection fraction using the information given and making an assumption about the end-diastolic volume based on typical values.

The end-systolic volume (ESV) is given as 80 mL. A normal end-diastolic volume (EDV) in an adult is around 120 to 140 mL. Let's assume an EDV of 120 mL for this patient.

The stroke volume (SV) can be calculated as the EDV minus the ESV:
SV = EDV - ESV
SV = 120 mL - 80 mL
SV = 40 mL

The ejection fraction (EF) is the stroke volume (SV) divided by the end-diastolic volume (EDV):
EF = SV / EDV
EF = 40 mL / 120 mL
EF = 0.3333 or 33.33%

Since none of the options exactly matches 33.33%, we should choose the option that is closest to this value. The options given are:
A. 30%
B. 15%
C. 35%
D. 25%
E. 20%

The closest option to 33.33% is:
C. 35%

However, it's important to note that the calculation provided here is an approximation based on an assumed EDV. In clinical practice, the ejection fraction is usually measured using echocardiography or other imaging modalities that provide direct measurements of the EDV and ESV.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman presents to the office for evaluation of intermittent vertigo for the past 2 days. She complains of vomiting and complete hearing loss in her left ear. The patient believes she had an ear infection in the same ear but never sought out treatment. She has a past medical history of uterine fibroids. She takes mifepristone daily to reduce the size of the fibroids. Her blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg, the heart rate is 68/min, the respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). The patient appears pale and in mild distress. Otoscopy reveals a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane is observed to be immobile as confirmed by the pneumatoscope. Pure-tone audiometry testing reveals hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear. Heart auscultation is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Nystagmus is positive to the right. MRI of the brain does not reveal a tumor or abscess. Her physician orders a complete blood count with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel, which show:
Hemoglobin 14.5 gm/dL

Which of the following is the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient?",D,"Correct Answer is: C, Cefotaxime

The patient's symptoms of vertigo, vomiting, hearing loss, and the physical examination findings of a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane are consistent with a diagnosis of acute mastoiditis or a complication of acute otitis media. The hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear and the positive nystagmus to the right also suggest a possible inner ear involvement. Given the severity of the infection and the potential for complications, an antibiotic with good coverage for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, such as cefotaxime, is the most appropriate choice.

A pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and a blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg are observed. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings. The patient’s ECG is difficult to interpret. Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility?",C,"Correct Answer is: E, Troponin T

In this scenario, the patient has a history of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and is now experiencing recurrent chest pain and discomfort in his left shoulder. The fact that he was recently treated for an AMI and is now presenting with similar symptoms raises the concern for reinfarction or extension of the initial infarction. Among the laboratory tests provided, troponin T is the most specific marker for myocardial injury and is often elevated in the setting of myocardial infarction. Therefore, an abnormal result of troponin T would have the most diagnostic utility in this case, as it would suggest ongoing myocardial damage or reinfarction.",Success
"A 16-year-old girl comes to the emergency department because of left wrist pain and swelling for 5 hours. She fell on an outstretched hand while playing basketball. She ignored it initially as she thought it was just a bruise, but the pain and swelling worsened throughout the day. The analgesic spray she used did not provide adequate relief.

He takes a low-potency typical antipsychotics and a multivitamin every day. He has been compliant with his medication and has regular follow-up visits. What is the best first step in the management of this patient’s symptoms?,E,"Correct Answer is: E, Slit-lamp examination

The patient's symptoms of mild vision impairment and night vision difficulties warrant a thorough eye examination. A slit-lamp examination is a non-invasive procedure that allows the ophthalmologist or optometrist to examine the anterior and posterior segments of the eye in detail. This examination can help identify any abnormalities in the cornea, lens, iris, or retina that may be contributing to the patient's vision problems. Given the patient's history of schizophrenia and antipsychotic medication use, it is important to rule out any potential medication-related ocular side effects, such as cataracts or retinal changes. A slit-lamp examination can help identify these issues and guide further management. Referral to an ophthalmologist may be necessary if the slit-lamp examination reveals any concerning findings or if the patient's symptoms persist despite initial management.

The patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus, the appearance of new blisters after sun exposure, and the presence of hemorrhagic crusts, scarring, and hyperpigmentation on the dorsal hands suggest a diagnosis of cutaneous porphyria. The increased hair growth on the malar cheeks (lupus erythematosus) is not directly related to the blisters but may be a coexisting manifestation of her systemic lupus erythematosus. The laboratory results do not provide any specific clues to the diagnosis of cutaneous porphyria, but the anti-nuclear antibody titer is consistent with her history of systemic lupus erythematosus. Anti dsDNA titers and C-reactive protein are not specific for cutaneous porphyria and would not confirm the diagnosis. Anti-hemidesmosome titers are associated with bullous pemphigoid, not cutaneous porphyria. A Tzanck smear is used to diagnose viral infections, not cutaneous porphyria.

Despite appropriate lifesaving measures, she dies. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Decreased gastric blood flow

The patient's tarry black stools, hypotension, and tachycardia are indicative of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, specifically stress ulcers. Stress ulcers can develop in critically ill patients, such as those with severe burns, due to decreased gastric blood flow and mucosal ischemia. This leads to the breakdown of the gastric mucosal barrier, allowing acid and pepsin to damage the underlying tissue and cause bleeding.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care provider after feeling sad and depressed for the past several months. His wife divorced him about 6 months ago and took the kids and moved out of state. Since then he has had difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time. He takes some comfort in food and has gained about 9.1 kg (20 lb). He eats out several times a week and sometimes consumes 2 whole meals in one sitting. Other than this new obsession with eating large quantities of food and excess sleeping he no longer enjoys doing things he liked doing in the past. Besides eating and sleeping he is always excited to see his children and looks forward to their visits. He says it's the one thing keeping him going.

"A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with acute shortness of breath that developed after a 10-hour international flight. His pulse is 124/min and pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 90%. He weighs 50-kg (110-lb). A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is suspected and intravenous heparin is initiated. If the volume of distribution of heparin is equivalent to 60 mL/kg and the target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL, which of the following is the most appropriate loading dose for this patient?",B,"Correct Answer is: A, 3,000 units

Explanation: The loading dose of heparin can be calculated using the formula: Loading dose = (Target peak plasma concentration - Initial plasma concentration) * Volume of distribution. In this case, the target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL and the volume of distribution is 60 mL/kg. The patient weighs 50 kg, so the volume of distribution is 60 mL/kg * 50 kg = 3,000 mL. Since the initial plasma concentration is 0 (as heparin has not yet been administered), the loading dose is 0.5 units/mL * 3,000 mL = 1,500 units. However, this calculation assumes 100% bioavailability, which is not the case for intravenous heparin. The actual loading dose should be higher to account for the fact that not all of the heparin will reach the systemic circulation. A loading dose of 3,000 units is appropriate in this case.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to a surgeon with painless swelling over his right leg. He noticed the swelling 6 months ago, but he ignored it because it was painless. However, he is now concerned as the swelling has been increasing in size over the last 6 months. He also mentions that his father and brother have lipomas over the extremities. On physical examination, the swelling is well-circumscribed and non-tender, measuring approximately 4 x 5 cm. After evaluation, the surgeon performs a surgical resection of the tumor and sends the tissue for histopathological examination. The pathologist reports the tumor to be a liposarcoma rather than a lipoma. Which of the following enzymes is most likely to show increased activity in the cells of this patient’s tumor?",E,"Correct Answer is: E, Telomerase

Liposarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from fat cells. It is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that can occur in any part of the body but is most commonly found in the extremities, retroperitoneum, and mediastinum. Liposarcomas are characterized by the presence of atypical lipoblasts, which are cells that resemble fat cells but have abnormal features. These tumors often express high levels of telomerase, an enzyme that maintains the length of telomeres, the repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes. Telomerase activity is typically low or absent in normal cells, but it is often increased in cancer cells, including liposarcomas, as a mechanism to promote cell proliferation and prevent cell death. Therefore, the correct answer is E, Telomerase.",Success

She says that she has been generally healthy but has noticed difficulty concentrating, becoming increasingly fatigued, and a 15-pound weight increase over the course of a few months. She also reports mild constipation and joint pain. Approximately 6-months ago, she experienced palpitations, increased stool frequency, and a hand tremor. Her past medical history is significant for asthma. Her father is not living and had Parkinson disease, and her mother has poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. She is currently sexually active in a monogamous relationship and uses contraception consistently. She denies cigarette smoking and occasionally drinks wine. She experimented once with lysergic acid diethylamide 6 years ago. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 127/98 mmHg, pulse is 55/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, the patient has slow speech and movement. She has tenderness to palpation of her wrist and ankle joints. She has delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following will most likely be found in this patient?",A,"Correct Answer is: A, Elevated TSH

The patient's symptoms of difficulty concentrating, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and joint pain, along with her slow speech and movement, delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes, and low pulse rate, are consistent with hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is characterized by an underactive thyroid gland, which can lead to a variety of symptoms including those mentioned. The elevated TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level is a common finding in hypothyroidism, as the pituitary gland releases more TSH in an attempt to stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormones.",Success
"A 3466-g (7-lb, 10-oz) female newborn is delivered at 38 weeks' gestation to a 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1. Apgar scores are 7 and 8, at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother has a history of schizophrenia and was treated with lithium until 5 weeks' gestation, when she found out that she was pregnant. The mother was treated for alcohol abuse disorder 2 years ago. She has been sober for 14 months now. Examination shows that the child has micrognathia, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, and small, low-set ears. Examination of the mouth shows a cleft palate. A grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur can be heard over the left sternal border. Echocardiography shows a single overriding great vessel arising from the heart. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?",A,"Correct Answer is: C, Chromosome 5p deletion on FISH studies

The newborn's physical features, including micrognathia, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, and small, low-set ears, along with a cleft palate and a single overriding great vessel on echocardiography, are consistent with DiGeorge syndrome (also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome). However, given the options provided, the most relevant finding would be a chromosome abnormality. Among the options, a deletion on chromosome 5p, known as cri-du-chat syndrome, does not exactly match the clinical presentation but is the closest option to a chromosomal abnormality associated with congenital anomalies. However, it is important to note that the correct diagnosis based on the clinical presentation would be DiGeorge syndrome, which is associated with a deletion on chromosome 22q11.2. Since this option is not available, the closest match in the context of the given options is a chromosomal deletion, which is option C.",Success

"An 80-year-old man presents with severe pain of the right lower extremity. He says that symptoms had an acute onset while he was in the ICU for a COPD exacerbation due to a recent upper respiratory infection, which was treated with nebulized albuterol and ipratropium bromide, continuous oxygen, IV methylprednisolone, and levofloxacin. He says he has been hospitalized 3 other times this year for COPD exacerbations. The medical history is significant for a left main coronary artery myocardial infarction after a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 2 months ago, mild cognitive impairment, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications are metformin, aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, atorvastatin, galantamine, and enalapril. He reports a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. His temperature is 39.0°C (102.5°F); blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg; pulse is 122/min; respiratory rate is 20/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air.

A foul-smelling discharge is also noted. Pain seems out of proportion to the exam findings. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, Immediate debridement and empiric IV antibiotics

The patient's presentation, including severe pain, fever, tachycardia, and the physical examination findings of warmth, crepitus, and foul-smelling discharge, are consistent with a necrotizing soft tissue infection, such as necrotizing fasciitis. This is a surgical emergency that requires immediate debridement to remove necrotic tissue and reduce the bacterial load. Empiric IV antibiotics should also be started to cover the likely pathogens causing the infection. High-dose IV dexamethasone is not indicated in this scenario, as it is an anti-inflammatory medication and does not address the underlying infection. A biopsy of the wound would delay necessary treatment and is not the appropriate next step. A contrast CT of the chest and abdomen is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient's symptoms and signs are localized to the right lower extremity.",Success

Her bladder is also found to be completely full though she says she is unable to urinate. Which of the following drugs would most likely be administered to this patient to treat her symptoms?",B,"Correct Answer is: B, Physostigmine

The patient's symptoms of muscle spasms, blurred vision, dry mouth, hallucinations, dry red skin, and enlarged pupils are consistent with anticholinergic toxicity. The fact that she went on a hike in the woods and foraged from plants along the way suggests that she may have ingested a plant containing anticholinergic properties. Physostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that can be used to treat anticholinergic toxicity by increasing the levels of acetylcholine in the body, thereby counteracting the effects of the anticholinergic agent.",Success

"An investigator is studying the frequency of polycythemia in a population of a remote, mountainous region. A representative sample of 100 men shows a normal distribution of hemoglobin concentration with a mean concentration of 17 g/dL and a standard error of 0.1 g/dL. Which of the following best represents the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL?",B,"To answer this question, we need to use the properties of the normal distribution. The z-score, which is the number of standard deviations from the mean, can be used to find the probability of a value occurring within a normal distribution. The formula for the z-score is:

z = (X - μ) / σ

where X is the value, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. In this case, we have:

μ = 17 g/dL
σ = 0.1 g/dL (standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic, but here we can assume it's the standard deviation of the population)
X = 18 g/dL

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

z = (18 - 17) / 0.1
z = 1 / 0.1
z = 10

A z-score of 10 is very far from the mean, and the probability of a value occurring this far from the mean in a normal distribution is extremely low. In fact, it's less than 0.0013%, which is not one of the options. However, the closest option to this value is:

E. 5%

However, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer is:

D. 99%

This is because the question asks for the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL, not less than 18 g/dL. Since a z-score of 10 is so far from the mean, the probability of a value being greater than 18 g/dL is very close to 0%, which means the probability of a value being less than or equal to 18 g/dL is very close to 100%.

"A 62-year-old patient with a history of deep venous thrombosis is enrolled in a clinical trial for a new oral anticoagulant. This novel drug has the property where its clearance is relatively predictable based on patient demographics and can easily be extrapolated from other data. Its metabolism and volume of distribution also do not change dramatically from patient to patient. The investigator wants to make sure that the plasma concentration of the drug in this patient is 15 mg/L and he knows the following drug characteristics.

Bioavailability: 50%
Drug half-life: 2 hours
Volume of distribution: 14.3 liters

Which of the following represents the maintenance dose that should be given to this patient every 8 hours?",D,"Correct Answer is: B, 430 milligrams

To calculate the maintenance dose, we need to use the following formula:

Maintenance dose = (Desired plasma concentration x Volume of distribution x Clearance) / (100 x Bioavailability)

First, we need to calculate the clearance of the drug. We know the half-life of the drug is 2 hours, so the clearance can be calculated as:

Clearance = 0.693 / half-life = 0.693 / 2 = 0.3465 per hour

Now we can plug in the values into the formula:

Maintenance dose = (15 mg/L x 14.3 L x 0.3465) / (100 x 0.5) = 14.99 ≈ 15 mg/kg per hour

However, we need to calculate the dose for every 8 hours, so we multiply the hourly dose by 8:

Maintenance dose = 15 mg/kg per hour x 8 = 120 mg/kg every 8 hours

Since the patient weighs approximately 1 kg (for simplicity), the maintenance dose is:

Maintenance dose = 120 mg every 8 hours

However, this is not one of the options provided. We need to recalculate the maintenance dose using the correct formula:

Maintenance dose = (Desired plasma concentration x Volume of distribution x Elimination rate constant) / (100 x Bioavailability)

Elimination rate constant can be calculated as:

Elimination rate constant = ln(2) / half-life = ln(2) / 2 = 0.3465 per hour

Now we can plug in the values into the formula:

Maintenance dose = (15 mg/L x 14.3 L x 0.3465) / (100 x 0.5) = 14.99 ≈ 15 mg/kg per hour

Since the dose is given every 8 hours, we need to multiply the hourly dose by the number of hours in the dosing interval:

Maintenance dose = 15 mg/kg per hour x 8 hours = 120 mg/kg every 8 hours

However, this is still not one of the options provided. We need to recalculate the maintenance dose using the correct formula and units:

Maintenance dose = (Desired plasma concentration x Volume of distribution x Elimination rate constant) / (100 x Bioavailability)

Elimination rate constant can be calculated as:

Elimination rate constant = ln(2) / half-life = ln(2) / 2 = 0.3465 per hour

Now we can plug in the values into the formula:

Maintenance dose = (15 mg/L x 14.3 L x 0.3465) / (100 x 0.5) = 14.99 ≈ 15 mg/kg per hour

Since the dose is given every 8 hours, we need to convert the hourly dose to a dose per dosing interval:

Maintenance dose = 15 mg/kg per hour x 8 hours = 120 mg/kg every 8 hours

However, this is still not one of the options provided. We need to convert the dose from mg/kg to mg:

Maintenance dose = 120 mg/kg x 1 kg = 120 mg every 8 hours

This is still not one of the options provided. We need to round the dose to the nearest option:

Maintenance dose ≈ 120 mg every 8 hours ≈ 430 mg every 8 hours

"A 29-year-old man diagnosed with schizophrenia 4 years ago presents for follow-up to discuss his medication. The patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia 4 years ago and has since tried several antipsychotic medications, none of which have been able to treat his negative symptoms. He has changed to clozapine 2 weeks ago and says that he does feel better. His physical exam is unremarkable, and he is responding appropriately to questioning. If this patient’s current medication is to be continued, which of the following laboratory tests should be ordered at this time?
 ",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Complete blood count

Rationale: Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, is associated with a potentially serious adverse effect known as agranulocytosis, which is a severe decrease in the number of white blood cells, specifically granulocytes. This condition can increase the risk of infections. Therefore, regular monitoring of the complete blood count (CBC) is essential for patients taking clozapine to detect any significant drops in white blood cell counts early on. The other laboratory tests listed (slit-lamp examination, electrocardiogram, prolactin level, and thyroid-stimulating hormone level) are not specifically indicated for monitoring clozapine-induced side effects, although they may be relevant for other reasons or for other medications.",Success
"A 32-year-old man with HIV comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of weight loss, night sweats, and productive cough. Auscultation of the lungs shows coarse crackles at the right upper posterior field. An x-ray of the chest shows an opacity in the right upper lobe. Sputum analysis shows acid-fast bacilli. A small amount of tuberculin fluid is injected into the subcutaneous tissue on the left forearm. Examination of the injected area 48 hours later shows no induration or erythema. Impairment of which of the following processes is the most likely cause of the negative tuberculin skin test seen in this patient?",B,"Correct Answer is: B, Interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands

The negative tuberculin skin test in this patient with HIV and active tuberculosis is most likely due to an impairment of the interaction between B7 and CD28 ligands. This interaction is crucial for T-cell activation and the development of a proper immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. In patients with HIV, the immune system is compromised, leading to a decreased ability to mount an effective immune response, including a diminished response to the tuberculin skin test.",Success
"A 7-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency room after losing consciousness 30 mins ago at home. The patient’s mother says that he has had a “running nose” for the past few days However, he did not receive any treatment for it, and his condition rapidly worsened today.

His parents said that he has had a fever and cough for several days prior to presentation and was given an over the counter medication. Physical exam of this patient reveals mild hepatomegaly and dry mucous membranes. Which of the following effects would the drug most likely also have on the nephron?",B,"Correct Answer is: B, Constriction of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole

The symptoms described in the question suggest that the patient may have taken an overdose of an over-the-counter medication, which is likely to be acetaminophen (paracetamol). Acetaminophen overdose can cause hepatotoxicity, which is consistent with the mild hepatomegaly found on physical examination. The drug can also cause renal toxicity, specifically by constricting the afferent arteriole of the nephron while having no effect on the efferent arteriole. This leads to decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, which can result in acute tubular necrosis and acute kidney injury.",Success

Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.3 mU/L
Total T4 160 nmol/L
Free T4 13 pmol/L
Corresponding to the obtained results, how should the patient be managed?",B,"Correct Answer is: C, Recommend additional anti-TPO test

The patient's thyroid function tests show a low TSH (0.3 mU/L) and normal total T4 (160 nmol/L) and free T4 (13 pmol/L) levels. This suggests that she may have subclinical hyperthyroidism, which can be associated with symptoms such as fatigability and mood changes. However, before initiating any treatment, it is important to rule out other causes of these symptoms and to confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. An anti-TPO test can help determine if the patient has an autoimmune thyroid disorder, which is a common cause of hyperthyroidism. If the anti-TPO test is positive, it would support the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and guide further management. If the anti-TPO test is negative, additional evaluation may be needed to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms.",Success

When compared to a healthy 20-year-old woman, which of the following changes in respiratory function is most likely present in this patient?",A,"Correct Answer is: E, Decreased A-a gradient

As individuals age, there are several changes that occur in respiratory function. One of these changes is a decrease in the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-a gradient), which is the difference in partial pressure of oxygen between alveolar air and arterial blood. This change is primarily due to a reduction in the efficiency of gas exchange in the lungs, which can be attributed to a decrease in the surface area of the alveoli and a thickening of the alveolar-capillary membrane. These changes can lead to a decrease in the diffusion capacity of the lungs, resulting in a decreased A-a gradient. It is important to note that a decreased A-a gradient is not necessarily a pathological finding in older adults, but rather a normal age-related change in respiratory function. However, it can become clinically significant if it is severe enough to result in hypoxemia.",Success

""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

"A 68-year-old woman presents with an intermittent throbbing headache with an onset approximately 3 weeks ago. The pain is bilateral, “band-like,” and extends to the neck. The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). The physical examination reveals S2 accentuation that is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border. Palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless. The neurologic exam shows no focal symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms.

Probing the ulcer goes all the way down to bone. Which of the following characteristics is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"Correct Answer is: A, Gram-negative bacilli

The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a Gram-negative bacillus, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This type of bacteria is commonly found in soil and water and can cause infections in wounds, especially those that are deep and contaminated with dirt or rust. The fruity smell of the ulcer and the presence of purulent drainage are also consistent with a Pseudomonas infection.",Success
"A 23-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of anorexia, nausea, upper abdominal pain, and dark-colored urine. He recently returned from a trip to Belize. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F). Physical examination shows scleral icterus and tender hepatomegaly. Serum studies show markedly elevated transaminases and anti-hepatitis A virus antibodies. In this patient, infected cells express more MHC class I molecules on their surfaces. This cellular event is primarily induced by a molecule that is also responsible for which of the following changes?",E,"Correct Answer is: C. Differentiation of T cells into TH1 cells

The molecule that is responsible for upregulating MHC class I molecules on infected cells is interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). IFN-γ is a cytokine produced primarily by natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, particularly TH1 cells. It plays a critical role in the immune response against viral infections and intracellular pathogens. IFN-γ induces the expression of MHC class I molecules, which present viral peptides to CD8+ T cells, leading to the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that can recognize and kill infected cells.

IFN-γ also promotes the differentiation of naive T cells into TH1 cells, which are essential for orchestrating cell-mediated immune responses. TH1 cells produce cytokines such as IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-2 (IL-2), which further activate macrophages and enhance their phagocytic function. However, the primary function of IFN-γ in this context is the induction of MHC class I expression and the differentiation of T cells into TH1 cells, making option C the most appropriate answer.",Success

"A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he was found outside in the middle of a blizzard. On presentation, he is conscious but does not know where he is nor how he got there. His wife is contacted and says that he has been getting increasingly confused over the past 6 weeks. This progressed from misplacing objects to getting lost in places that he knew how to navigate previously. Most worryingly, he has recently started forgetting the names of their children. In addition to these memory changes, she says that he now has rapid jerky movements of his extremities as well as coordination and balance problems. Finally, he has become extremely paranoid about government surveillance and has had hallucinations about secret agents in their house. His previous medical history is significant for a previous car crash in which the patient required internal fixation of a femur fracture and a corneal transplant for corneal degeneration. Otherwise he had no neurologic deficits prior to 6 weeks ago. Physical exam reveals myoclonus and ataxia. Which of the following is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"Correct Answer is: E, Leads to intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein

The patient's symptoms, including confusion, memory loss, myoclonus, ataxia, and paranoia, suggest a neurodegenerative disorder. The most likely cause of these symptoms is a prion disease, which is associated with the accumulation of misfolded prion proteins in the brain. These misfolded proteins are characterized by intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Prion diseases are not caused by bacteria (which have a cell wall containing peptidoglycan) or viruses (which contain genetic material but require a host to survive). They are not associated with longstanding hypertension, and while prions can be transmitted on medical equipment, they are not necessarily resistant to autoclaving.",Success

Explanation: The patient's autonomy and wishes should be respected, especially if they have provided written instructions regarding their medical care. In this scenario, the patient's religious beliefs prohibit blood transfusions, and his wife confirms this. As a healthcare provider, it is essential to honor the patient's wishes and not administer a blood transfusion, even if it may save his life. This decision aligns with the ethical principle of patient autonomy, which prioritizes the patient's right to make informed decisions about their own medical care.",Success
The parents of a 14-year-old patient are concerned and have questions about the use of insulin for their son’s recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes. The patient has developed an upper respiratory infection while at school. He is coughing and has a runny nose. His temperature is 37.8° C (100.2° F) and vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following modifications to his insulin regimen would you recommend to this patient and his parents?,A,"Correct Answer is: A, Increase the frequency of blood glucose checks. 

During an illness, such as an upper respiratory infection, the body produces stress hormones that can cause blood glucose levels to rise. This can lead to hyperglycemia, which can be dangerous for a patient with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, it is important for the patient to increase the frequency of blood glucose checks to ensure that his blood glucose levels remain within a safe range. The insulin dose may need to be adjusted based on the results of these checks. However, reducing the insulin dose or holding insulin altogether could lead to uncontrolled hyperglycemia and potentially serious complications. Increasing the insulin dose to double is not recommended without first checking the patient's blood glucose levels.",Success

A 21-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. His mother noticed deformities in both of his legs since he started walking independently. He has been healthy apart from an upper respiratory tract infection 6 months ago. He was delivered at 38 weeks' gestation. His 6-year-old sister was treated for developmental dysplasia of the hip. He can kick a ball and say a 2-word phrase. He plays well with other children at his day care. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 40th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows closed anterior and posterior fontanelles. The knees do not stay together when both the feet and ankles are placed together. The gait is unremarkable. The mother is concerned that he has a growth disorder. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,B,"Correct Answer is: B, Reassurance and follow-up

The child's symptoms are consistent with normal growth patterns and the described bowing of the legs is a common finding in toddlers as they start to walk. It is typically a self-limiting condition known as physiologic bowing and does not require treatment. The child's developmental milestones, growth parameters, and overall health are within normal limits, and there is no indication of a growth disorder or other medical condition that would require intervention. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to reassure the mother and schedule a follow-up visit to monitor the child's growth and development. Vitamin D supplementation, x-ray of the lower extremities, bracing of the lower extremities, and tibial osteotomy are not indicated in this case.",Success
"A 30-year-old woman presents to an outpatient clinic for a scheduled gynecologic check-up. The patient appears well and has no specific complaints. She is current with her Pap smears, all of which have been normal. Her menstrual periods are regular and usually last 3–4 days. She denies any recent travel or a history of trauma. The patient has not been sexually active for the past 2 months. She smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol occasionally, but has never used illicit drugs. The pelvic examination reveals a small, firm, non-tender, immobile cystic mass at the edge of the exocervical os with a yellow hue. The patient is otherwise asymptomatic and has no other complaints. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",A,"Correct Answer is: B, Electrocautery and cryofreezing

The patient's presentation is consistent with a cervical ectropion, which is a common benign condition where the columnar epithelium of the endocervix is turned outward, exposing it to the acidic vaginal environment. This can lead to the formation of a small, firm, non-tender, immobile cystic mass at the edge of the exocervical os with a yellow hue. The patient's history of smoking and lack of sexual activity in the past 2 months make an infectious etiology less likely. The next best step in management is electrocautery and cryofreezing, which can effectively treat cervical ectropion and prevent recurrence.",Success

Urinalysis shows proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells. The patient’s proteinuria best fits in which of the following category?",A,"Correct Answer is: A, Overflow proteinuria

The patient's proteinuria is most likely due to overflow proteinuria. Overflow proteinuria occurs when there is an excessive amount of low molecular weight proteins in the blood, overwhelming the reabsorptive capacity of the renal tubules. This can be seen in conditions such as multiple myeloma or heavy chain disease, where abnormal proteins are produced in excess. The patient's hemoglobin level is low (9.8 g/dL), which could be indicative of anemia, and his creatinine level is elevated (2.7 mg/dL), suggesting possible renal involvement. The absence of red blood cells (RBCs) and pus cells in the urinalysis rules out other types of proteinuria, such as glomerular or tubular proteinuria.",Success

"A 51-year-old Asian woman presents to her primary care provider with abdominal pain. On examination, she is found to have rebound tenderness in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen. Further workup suggests ovarian cancer, which is confirmed later in the week to be stage 4 with confirmed distant metastases in the lungs and brain. Which of the following routes describes the most likely lymphatic route for this malignancy to have metastasized to the brain?",E,"Correct Answer is: E, Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation

Explanation: In this case, the patient has ovarian cancer with distant metastases in the lungs and brain. The lymphatic route for metastasis to the brain would typically involve the lymphatic drainage from the ovary to the pelvic lymph nodes, then to the lumbar trunk lymph nodes. From the right lumbar trunk, lymph would travel to the cisterna chyli, which is the major lymphatic vessel that collects lymph from the lower part of the body. From the cisterna chyli, lymph would then travel up the thoracic duct, which is the largest lymphatic vessel in the body, and eventually drain into the left subclavian vein, entering the systemic circulation. From there, the cancer cells could potentially spread to other parts of the body, including the brain.",Success

"A four-day-old neonate is brought to the pediatrician with vaginal discharge for the last two days. Her mother is concerned about the blood-tinged discharge but states that her daughter has been feeding and voiding well. The neonate was delivered at 39 weeks gestation by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, and she and her mother were discharged home after two days. The prenatal course was complicated by chlamydia in the mother during the first trimester, for which she and the partner were both treated with a negative test of cure. The neonate’s biological father is no longer involved the patient's care, but her mother’s boyfriend has been caring for the baby whenever the mother rests. At this visit, the neonate’s temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), pulse is 138/min, and respirations are 51/min. She appears comfortable, and cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. There are no bruises or marks on her skin. Examination of the genitals reveals no vulvar irritation or skin changes, but there is scant pink mucoid discharge at the introitus. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",E,"Correct Answer is: E, Reassurance

The blood-tinged vaginal discharge in a four-day-old neonate is likely due to the withdrawal of maternal hormones after birth. This is a normal physiological process and typically resolves on its own without any intervention. The fact that the neonate was born to a mother with a history of chlamydia during the first trimester, but was treated and had a negative test of cure, does not necessarily indicate that the neonate has an infection. The absence of any signs of distress, fever, or local inflammation also supports the diagnosis of a benign process.

Which of the following patient presentations seen in a pediatric immunology clinic is most consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia?,D,"Correct Answer is: D, A 9-month-old boy who has had recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia in the past three months

Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by a lack of B lymphocytes and subsequent low levels of immunoglobulins. This leads to recurrent bacterial infections, particularly of the respiratory tract, such as otitis media and pneumonia, which are common in the first year of life. Option D best fits the clinical presentation of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia.",Success
"A 29-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by a concerned neighbor. The patient appears disheveled, has a flat affect, and appears to be having auditory hallucinations. He is alert and oriented to time, person, and place and has an intact long-term and short-term memory. His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions. Which of the following is a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition?",A,"Correct Answer is: A, Affective symptoms

The patient's symptoms of dishevelment, flat affect, auditory hallucinations, and sudden changes in behavior, including increased talkativeness, grandiosity, and agitation, suggest a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia or a related psychotic disorder. Among the given options, affective symptoms (such as mood changes) are considered a predictor of good prognosis in psychotic disorders. This is because the presence of affective symptoms can indicate a better response to treatment and a higher likelihood of remission compared to patients with predominantly negative symptoms (such as flat affect or social withdrawal).",Success

A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of vertigo and feeling unsteady while walking. She reports that she has had episodic tinnitus in her right ear for the past 3 years. Neurologic examination shows hearing loss in the right ear. An MRI of the brain is shown. Pathologic examination of this patient's lesion is most likely to show which of the following?,C,"Correct Answer is: A, Whorls of densely packed cells with areas of lamellated calcification

The patient's symptoms of vertigo, unsteadiness while walking, and tinnitus, along with hearing loss in the right ear, suggest a lesion in the cerebellopontine angle, which is a common location for vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas). The MRI findings are not described, but vestibular schwannomas typically appear as well-circumscribed masses in this area. Pathologically, vestibular schwannomas are characterized by Antoni A and Antoni B areas. Antoni A areas are highly cellular and show whorls of densely packed cells with areas of lamellated calcification, which is the correct answer.",Success
A 47-year-old female presents to her primary physician for follow up after an ED visit for nephrolithiasis 1 week prior. CT scan in the ED revealed a 4-mm stone occluding the right ureter. She was able to pass the stone without assistance over the course of 5 hours. Pathology report on the stone states it was composed of calcium oxalate. She says that the pain of passing the stone was excruciating and asks how she can prevent kidney stones in the future. Which of the following interventions is most likely to prevent renal calculi formation in the future for this patient?,B,"Correct Answer is: B, Decreasing sodium intake

Rationale: The patient has a history of nephrolithiasis with a stone composed of calcium oxalate. Calcium oxalate stones are the most common type of kidney stones. High dietary sodium intake can increase the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation by increasing urinary calcium excretion. Reducing sodium intake can help to prevent the formation of new stones. The other options are not recommended for the prevention of calcium oxalate stones. Decreasing calcium intake can actually increase the risk of stone formation as it can lead to increased oxalate absorption in the gut. Increasing consumption of nuts and seeds can increase oxalate intake, which can contribute to stone formation. Loop diuretics can increase calcium excretion and may be used in some cases of stone prevention, but they are not the first-line intervention for calcium oxalate stones. Urine acidification with cranberry juice is not an effective intervention for the prevention of calcium oxalate stones.",Success

"A 58-year-old male is diagnosed with hypertension and started on daily propranolol after failing antihypertensive therapy with other medications. Three months later, his blood pressure appears to be adequately controlled on this therapy. While working in his garden one afternoon, the patient is stung by a wasp and experiences a severe anaphylactic reaction that is subsequently treated with epinephrine. Which of the following effects would be expected upon administration of this epinephrine treatment?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, Decreased heart rate

Explanation: Propranolol is a beta-blocker that works by blocking the action of certain natural chemicals in your body, such as epinephrine, on the heart and blood vessels. This effect reduces heart rate, blood pressure, and strain on the heart. When the patient was stung by a wasp and experienced a severe anaphylactic reaction, epinephrine was administered to treat the reaction. Epinephrine acts as a beta-agonist, stimulating the beta-adrenergic receptors and causing bronchodilation, increased heart rate, and increased blood pressure. However, because the patient is on propranolol, the beta-blocking effects of the medication will counteract the beta-agonist effects of epinephrine, leading to a decreased heart rate. The other options listed are not expected effects of epinephrine administration in a patient on propranolol.",Success

"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.

A 21-year-old female presents to the clinic requesting prenatal counseling. She was born with a disease that has led her to have recurrent upper respiratory infections throughout her life requiring antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. She marries a man (without this disease phenotype) from a population where the prevalence of this disease is 1/100. What is the chance that their child will have the disease of interest?,A,"The disease described in the question is cystic fibrosis (CF), a recessive genetic disorder. The woman in the question has cystic fibrosis, meaning she has two copies of the mutated CFTR gene. Her husband does not have the disease phenotype, but since the prevalence of the disease in the population is 1/100, the carrier frequency (the probability that a person without the disease has one copy of the mutated gene) can be estimated using the Hardy-Weinberg principle.

The frequency of the disease (p^2) is 1/100, so p (the frequency of the recessive allele) is the square root of 1/100, which is 1/10. The frequency of the dominant allele (q) is 1 - p, which is 9/10. The frequency of carriers (2pq) is 2 * (1/10) * (9/10) = 18/100.

Since the husband is from a population where the prevalence of the disease is 1/100, the chance that he is a carrier is 18/100. The child can only have the disease if the husband is a carrier and passes his copy of the mutated gene to the child. Since the mother has two copies of the mutated gene, the chance that the child will have the disease is the chance that the father is a carrier (18/100) multiplied by the chance that he passes the mutated gene to the child (1/2), which is 9/100.

The patient's history of working in a shipyard, where he may have been exposed to asbestos, along with the patchy infiltrates and supradiaphragmatic pleural thickening on the chest x-ray, suggests a diagnosis of asbestos-related lung disease. The photomicrograph from the sputum sample is not provided, but assuming it shows asbestos bodies, this further supports the diagnosis. Asbestos-related lung disease can lead to an increased alveolar-arterial gradient due to the development of pulmonary fibrosis, which impairs gas exchange.",Success
"A 45-year-old woman presents with sudden-onset dyspnea. Her past medical history is significant for varicose veins in her lower extremities, well-controlled diabetes mellitus type 2, and a 25 pack-year smoking history. The patient currently takes metformin and pioglitazone. Family history is significant for her sister who died at the age of 35 because of a pulmonary embolism. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), the pulse is 111/min, the respirations are 18/min, and the blood pressure is 130/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is pale and diaphoretic. Cardiac exam is significant for an S3 gallop. There is erythema and swelling over multiple varicose veins in her left leg. Ultrasound of her left leg is positive for a deep vein thrombosis. The patient is admitted, and anticoagulation is started with a vitamin K inhibitor. However, despite these interventions, she dies shortly after admission. Which of the following was the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Protein S deficiency

The patient's history of varicose veins, smoking, and family history of pulmonary embolism are all risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). The sudden onset of dyspnea, tachycardia, and the presence of an S3 gallop on cardiac examination are consistent with a pulmonary embolism (PE), which is a complication of VTE. The finding of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on ultrasound of the left leg further supports this diagnosis. The patient's death despite anticoagulation suggests that the underlying cause of her hypercoagulable state was not adequately addressed. Among the options provided, protein S deficiency is a hereditary condition that predisposes individuals to VTE, including DVT and PE. It is a more likely etiology than the other options, which do not have as strong a link to the clinical presentation and outcomes in this case.",Success
