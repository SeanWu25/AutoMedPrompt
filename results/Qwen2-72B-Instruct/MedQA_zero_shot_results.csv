"A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?",C,"The correct next action for the resident to take is:

B. Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report.

It is important to maintain transparency and honesty with the patient regarding any complications that occur during surgery. This not only respects the patient's right to know about their medical care but also fulfills ethical and legal obligations. Additionally, documenting the complication in the operative report is necessary for maintaining accurate medical records and for the patient's future medical care.",Success
A 67-year-old man with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of ringing sensation in his ear. He received this first course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 week ago. Pure tone audiometry shows a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB. The expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to which of the following actions?,E,"The drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely a platinum-based chemotherapy agent, which is known to cause ototoxicity as a side effect. Platinum-based agents work by cross-linking DNA, which interferes with DNA replication and repair, leading to cell death. Therefore, the expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to option E: Cross-linking of DNA.",Success
"Two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catherization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man has decreased urinary output and malaise. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin and naproxen. He was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Examination shows mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin count 14 g/dL
Leukocyte count 16,400/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 56%
Eosinophils 11%
Lymphocytes 31%
Monocytes 2%
Platelet count 260,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 68 mm/h

Urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL
Creatinine 4.2 mg/dL
Renal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?""",C,"The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is C. Cholesterol embolization. The clinical presentation, including the mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet (livedo reticularis), decreased urinary output, and malaise, along with the laboratory findings of acute kidney injury (elevated serum creatinine and urea nitrogen) and the renal biopsy showing intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles, are consistent with cholesterol embolization syndrome. This condition can occur after cardiac interventions, such as the patient's recent cardiac catheterization, and can be associated with underlying atherosclerosis, as seen in patients with diabetes and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The presence of eosinophilia may also be seen in cholesterol embolization syndrome.",Success
"A 39-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of fevers, chills, and left lower quadrant pain. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.3°F), pulse is 126/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. There is blood oozing around the site of a peripheral intravenous line. Pelvic examination shows mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os and left adnexal tenderness. Laboratory studies show:
Platelet count 14,200/mm3
Fibrinogen 83 mg/mL (N = 200–430 mg/dL)
D-dimer 965 ng/mL (N < 500 ng/mL)
When phenol is applied to a sample of the patient's blood at 90°C, a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain is identified. A blood culture is most likely to show which of the following?""",D,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a severe bacterial infection with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is supported by the low platelet count, low fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimer levels. The patient's symptoms and signs are consistent with a pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is often caused by sexually transmitted pathogens. The identification of a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain suggests the presence of lipoteichoic acid, a component of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria.

The most likely pathogen in this scenario is a gram-positive cocci, given the patient's clinical presentation and the laboratory findings. Among the options provided, the most likely pathogen is:

A. Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci forming mauve-colored colonies on methicillin-containing agar

This description fits Staphylococcus aureus, which is a common cause of severe infections and can lead to DIC. However, it is important to note that PID is more commonly caused by gram-negative bacteria such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis. The presence of Staphylococcus aureus in this scenario could be due to a secondary infection or contamination from the intravenous line site. The other options are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation and the laboratory findings.",Success
"A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of itchy, watery eyes for the past week. He has also been sneezing multiple times a day during this period. He had a similar episode 1 year ago around springtime. He has iron deficiency anemia and ankylosing spondylitis. Current medications include ferrous sulfate, artificial tear drops, and indomethacin. He works as an elementary school teacher. His vital signs are within normal limits. Visual acuity is 20/20 without correction. Physical examination shows bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge. The pupils are 3 mm, equal, and reactive to light. Examination of the anterior chamber of the eye is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",B,"The most appropriate treatment for the patient's symptoms of itchy, watery eyes and sneezing, which are likely due to seasonal allergies, would be option B, Ketotifen eye drops. Ketotifen is an antihistamine that is used to relieve the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, such as itching and redness of the eyes. It does not treat the underlying cause of the allergy, but it can provide relief from the symptoms. The other options listed are not appropriate for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Erythromycin ointment is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, warm compresses are used to relieve pain and swelling, Fluorometholone eye drops are a steroid used to treat inflammation, and Latanoprost eye drops are used to treat glaucoma.",Success
A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of progressively worsening chest pain and nausea that started at a local bar 30 minutes prior. The pain radiates to the epigastric area. He has a 5-year history of untreated hypertension. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 5 years and started abusing cocaine 2 weeks before his emergency room visit. The patient is diaphoretic and in marked distress. What should be the first step in management?,E,"The first step in management for this patient should be E. Reassurance and continuous monitoring. However, this answer does not fully address the immediate needs of the patient. In a real-life scenario, the initial steps would include assessing the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs), providing supplemental oxygen, and preparing for potential resuscitation. After ensuring the patient's stability, the next step would be to administer aspirin (not listed as an option) and consider nitroglycerin (option C) to relieve chest pain if the patient's blood pressure is not too low. Continuous ECG monitoring is also crucial to assess for signs of acute coronary syndrome. Reassurance and continuous monitoring (option E) are important, but they should be part of a broader, more immediate, and comprehensive approach to managing this patient's acute symptoms.",Success
A 68-year-old male comes to the physician for evaluation of right flank pain. He has a history of diabetes and peripheral artery disease. His blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows abdominal tenderness and right flank tenderness. An ultrasound shows dilation of the right ureter and renal pelvis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?,D,"The most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is an obstruction in the urinary tract, given the symptoms and ultrasound findings. Among the options provided, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common cause of ureteral obstruction in men, particularly in those over 60 years of age. BPH can lead to urinary retention and subsequent dilation of the ureter and renal pelvis, which are seen in the ultrasound findings. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B. Benign prostatic hyperplasia

However, it's important to note that further evaluation may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, such as a ureteral stone or tumor.",Success
"A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after the onset of acute chest pain. He has hypertension and asthma. Current medications include atorvastatin, lisinopril, and an albuterol inhaler. He appears pale and diaphoretic. His pulse is 114/min and blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg. An ECG shows ST-segment depressions in leads II, III, and aVF. Laboratory studies show an increased serum troponin T concentration. The patient is treated for acute coronary syndrome and undergoes percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. At the time of discharge, echocardiography shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 58%. In addition to aspirin, which of the following drugs should be added to this patient's medication regimen?",C,"C. Clopidogrel

The patient has been diagnosed with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and has undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCI). Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor such as clopidogrel is recommended for at least 12 months after PCI in patients with ACS to prevent thrombotic complications. Nifedipine, enoxaparin, spironolactone, and propranolol are not indicated in this scenario. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker used for hypertension and angina, enoxaparin is an anticoagulant used in the acute phase of ACS, spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist used in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and propranolol is a beta-blocker used for various indications including hypertension, angina, and heart failure.",Success
"A 37-year-old-woman presents to her primary care physician requesting a new form of birth control. She has been utilizing oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for the past 8 years, but asks to switch to an intrauterine device (IUD). Her vital signs are: blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg, pulse 73/min and respiratory rate 16/min. She is afebrile. Physical examination is within normal limits. Which of the following past medical history statements would make copper IUD placement contraindicated in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD), whether copper or hormonal, is contraindicated in patients with active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can be exacerbated by the insertion of an IUD, potentially leading to further complications such as infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and ectopic pregnancy.

Options A, B, D, and E are not direct contraindications for copper IUD placement, although certain conditions may require additional monitoring or consideration. For example, women with a history of stroke or venous thromboembolism (A) may be at increased risk for these events with hormonal contraceptives but not with a copper IUD. Current tobacco use (B) can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, but it is not a contraindication for copper IUD use. A past medical history of breast cancer (D) or a known liver neoplasm (E) does not necessarily preclude the use of a copper IUD, as these conditions are more relevant to the use of hormonal contraceptives.",Success
A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because she is embarrassed about the appearance of her nails. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She appears well. A photograph of the nails is shown. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?,A,"The photograph of the nails is not provided in the text, but based on the description of the patient's concern being about the appearance of her nails and the lack of other symptoms or medical history, we can attempt to infer the most likely additional finding by considering each option in relation to nail abnormalities.

A. Silvery plaques on extensor surfaces - This is a description of psoriasis, which can affect the nails, causing pitting, discoloration, and other changes. However, without a specific description of the nail changes, this is speculative.

B. Flesh-colored papules in the lumbosacral region - This could be a description of any number of skin conditions, such as warts or molluscum contagiosum, which are not typically associated with nail changes.

C. Erosions of the dental enamel - This is typically associated with conditions like bulimia nervosa or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which are not directly related to nail changes.

D. Pallor of the conjunctival mucosa - This is a sign of anemia, which can cause brittle nails or spoon-shaped nails (koilonychia). If the patient's nails are showing signs of brittleness or spooning, this could be an indication of anemia, making this the most likely additional finding based on the information given.

E. Holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border - This could indicate a heart murmur, which is not typically associated with nail changes.

Given the options, the most likely additional finding in this patient, assuming her nail changes are related to an underlying condition, would be pallor of the conjunctival mucosa, which could indicate anemia.

"A 24-year-old G2P1 woman at 39 weeks’ gestation presents to the emergency department complaining of painful contractions occurring every 10 minutes for the past 2 hours, consistent with latent labor. She says she has not experienced vaginal discharge, bleeding, or fluid leakage, and is currently taking no medications. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 86/min, and temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F). She has had little prenatal care and uses condoms inconsistently. Her sexually transmitted infections status is unknown. As part of the patient’s workup, she undergoes a series of rapid screening tests that result in the administration of zidovudine during delivery. The infant is also given zidovudine to reduce the risk of transmission. A confirmatory test is then performed in the mother to confirm the diagnosis of HIV. Which of the following is most true about the confirmatory test?",E,"The most true statement about the confirmatory test in this scenario is:

E. It is an HIV-1/HIV2 antibody differentiation immunoassay

This type of test is used to confirm the presence of HIV antibodies and to differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2, which is important for appropriate treatment and management. The other options (A, B, C, and D) are not correct because they describe different types of tests that are not typically used for HIV confirmation in this context.",Success
"A 72-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue and worsening abdominal pain. During this period, he also has excessive night sweats and shortness of breath on exertion. Over the past 3 months, he has had a 5.6-kg (12-lb) weight loss. He had a myocardial infarction 3 years ago. He has hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic bronchitis. His medications include insulin, aspirin, lisinopril, and an albuterol inhaler. He has smoked half a pack of cigarettes for the past 45 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. The spleen is palpated 6 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 6.4 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 85 μm3
Leukocyte count 5,200/mm3
Platelet count 96,000/mm3
A blood smear is shown. Bone marrow aspiration shows extensive fibrosis and a few scattered plasma cells. A JAK 2 assay is positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",D,"The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and bone marrow biopsy results are consistent with a diagnosis of Myelofibrosis, a myeloproliferative neoplasm. The positive JAK2 assay further supports this diagnosis, as mutations in the JAK2 gene are common in myelofibrosis. The patient's symptoms, including fatigue, abdominal pain, night sweats, and weight loss, as well as the splenomegaly, are all indicative of advanced disease.

In the context of myelofibrosis, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient would be D. Ruxolitinib. Ruxolitinib is a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis. It has been shown to improve symptoms, reduce spleen size, and improve overall survival in patients with myelofibrosis.

Options A (Cladribine), B (Prednisone), and C (Imatinib) are not typically used for the treatment of myelofibrosis. Cladribine is used for hairy cell leukemia, Prednisone is a corticosteroid used for a variety of conditions but not specifically for myelofibrosis, and Imatinib is used for chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, which are driven by specific tyrosine kinase mutations.

Option E (Stem cell transplantation) is a potential curative option for myelofibrosis but is usually reserved for younger patients with high-risk disease and suitable donors. Given the patient's age and comorbidities, stem cell transplantation may be associated with significant risks and is not the most appropriate initial management choice.",Success
A 20-year-old man comes to the physician because of worsening gait unsteadiness and bilateral hearing loss for 1 month. He has had intermittent tingling sensations on both cheeks over this time period. He has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications. Audiometry shows bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Genetic evaluation shows a mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes merlin. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions?,B,"The patient's symptoms and the genetic evaluation result suggest a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2), which is associated with a mutation in the tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes merlin. NF2 is characterized by the development of bilateral vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas), which can cause hearing loss and gait unsteadiness. Patients with NF2 are also at increased risk for developing meningiomas, which are tumors that arise from the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Meningioma.",Success
"A 47-year-old executive schedules an appointment his physician for a routine medical check-up. He currently has no complaints and claims to be “as fit as a fiddle.” The physical examination findings are unremarkable, except for a mid-systolic murmur heard in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids on auscultation. The physician instructs the patient to stand from a supine position with the stethoscope still placed on his chest. Which of the following changes would occur with this maneuver?",E,"The correct answer is E. A reduction in diastolic filling time.

When the patient stands up from a supine position, there is a transient reduction in venous return to the heart due to the effects of gravity. This maneuver causes a decrease in preload, which is the end-diastolic volume of blood in the ventricles. As a result, diastolic filling time is reduced because there is less time for the ventricles to fill with blood before the next systole. This can lead to a decrease in stroke volume and cardiac output initially, but the body compensates through the baroreceptor reflex, which increases heart rate and systemic vascular resistance to maintain blood pressure.

The other options do not accurately describe the changes that occur with this maneuver:

A. An increase in right atrial pressure would not occur immediately upon standing, as the reduction in venous return would initially decrease right atrial pressure.

B. An increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure would not occur because the decrease in venous return reduces preload and thus decreases end-diastolic pressure.

C. An increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure would not occur because the maneuver reduces preload, which would lead to a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

D. A reduction in the slope of the pacemaker potential is not related to the hemodynamic changes that occur with standing up from a supine position. The slope of the pacemaker potential is related to the electrical activity of the heart's pacemaker cells and does not change with postural changes.",Success
"A microbiologist is studying the emergence of a virulent strain of the virus. After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection. Which of the following viruses is capable of undergoing the above-mentioned process?",D,"The process described in the question is known as reassortment, which occurs when a host cell is co-infected with two different viruses that belong to the same family and have segmented genomes. During replication, the segmented genomes can mix and match, leading to the creation of a new strain of the virus with a unique combination of genome segments. This process is common in viruses with segmented RNA genomes.

Out of the options provided, only one virus has a segmented genome that would allow for reassortment:

D. Rotavirus

Rotavirus is a double-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome. It belongs to the family Reoviridae and is known to undergo reassortment, which can lead to the emergence of new strains. This process has been implicated in the evolution of rotavirus strains that cause outbreaks of gastroenteritis in humans and animals.

Cytomegalovirus (A), Epstein-Barr virus (B), Human immunodeficiency virus (C), and Vaccinia virus (E) do not have segmented genomes and thus are not capable of undergoing reassortment as described in the question.",Success
"A 59-year-old overweight woman presents to the urgent care clinic with the complaint of severe abdominal pain for the past 2 hours. She also complains of a dull pain in her back with nausea and vomiting several times. Her pain has no relation with food. Her past medical history is significant for recurrent abdominal pain due to cholelithiasis. Her father died at the age of 60 with some form of abdominal cancer. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical exam is unremarkable. However, a CT scan of the abdomen shows a calcified mass near her gallbladder. Which of the following diagnoses should be excluded first in this patient?",B,"The diagnosis that should be excluded first in this patient is acute cholecystitis (Option A). The patient's symptoms, including severe abdominal pain, back pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with her history of cholelithiasis (gallstones), suggest a possible acute inflammatory process in the gallbladder. However, since the CT scan shows a calcified mass near the gallbladder, this finding is more suggestive of a mass lesion rather than acute inflammation. Acute cholecystitis typically presents with a distended gallbladder and pericholecystic fluid on imaging, rather than a calcified mass. Therefore, it is important to first rule out acute cholecystitis, which would require immediate surgical intervention if present, before considering other diagnoses that may not be as urgent.",Success
"A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a β-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen. Which of the following mediators is described in this experimental study?",E,"The mediator described in this experimental study is IL-4 (Option E). IL-4 is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of asthma by promoting the differentiation of naive T-helper cells into Th2 cells. These Th2 cells then produce more IL-4 and other cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13, which further exacerbate the asthmatic response. IL-4 is particularly important because it induces the class switching of B cells to produce IgE antibodies, which are key players in the allergic response. By attenuating the activity of IL-4, the experimental therapy aims to reduce the production of IgE and thereby lessen the exaggerated response to allergens in patients with asthma.",Success
"A 3-month-old boy is brought the emergency department by his parents after an episode of cyanosis and muscle hypotonia that resolved after 2 minutes. Diagnostic evaluation fails to discover an exact etiology of the boy's symptoms and the episode is classified as a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). The risk profile for BRUE in infants remains largely unknown. The pediatrician who saw the boy in the emergency department is trying to identify risk factors for BRUE. She is aware of several confounders, including age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She recruits 75 infants under 1 year of age with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE of the same age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She then compares the two groups with regard to history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection. Which of the following methods was conducted to control confounding bias in the study?",E,"The method used to control confounding bias in the study described is E. Matching. The pediatrician matched the two groups (infants with BRUE and infants without BRUE) on age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness to ensure that these potential confounders were equally distributed between the groups. This helps to isolate the effect of the variables of interest (history of feeding problems and recent upper respiratory infection) on the occurrence of BRUE.",Success

He has smoked 10 cigarettes per day for the past 7 years and occasionally drinks alcohol. He presents with vital signs: blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, regular radial pulse of 95/min, and temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F). On physical exam, a scratching sound of to-and-from character is audible over the left sternal border at end-expiration with the patient leaning forward. His chest X-ray is normal and ECG is shown in the picture. Which of the following is the optimal therapy for this patient?",B,"The patient's symptoms, including the central chest pain that is sharp, severe, increases when lying down, and improves with leaning forward, along with the radiating pain to his shoulders and neck, are suggestive of pericarditis. The presence of a scratching sound over the left sternal border at end-expiration, known as pericardial friction rub, further supports this diagnosis. The ECG is not provided, but typical findings in pericarditis include diffuse ST-segment elevation (except in leads aVR and V1) and PR-segment depression.

Given the diagnosis of pericarditis, the optimal therapy for this patient would be:

B. Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole

Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Colchicine is often added to NSAIDs in the treatment of pericarditis as it has been shown to decrease the recurrence of pericarditis and may also help in acute cases. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that can be added to protect the stomach lining from the potential gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs.

Indomethacin (Option A) is another NSAID that can be used in the treatment of pericarditis, but ibuprofen is often preferred due to its better side effect profile.

Prednisone (Option C) is a corticosteroid that may be used in refractory cases or in patients with recurrent pericarditis, but it is not the first-line treatment due to the risk of side effects and the potential for delaying the resolution of pericarditis.

Pericardiocentesis (Option D) is a procedure to drain fluid from around the heart and is indicated in cases of cardiac tamponade, a complication of pericarditis where there is a significant amount of fluid around the heart that compresses it and impairs its function. It is not indicated in uncomplicated pericarditis.

Pericardiectomy (Option E) is a surgical procedure to remove the pericardium and is reserved for cases of chronic constrictive pericarditis or recurrent pericarditis that does not respond to medical therapy. It is not the first-line treatment for acute pericarditis.",Success

"A 3-month-old infant is brought to her pediatrician because she coughs and seems to have difficulty breathing while feeding. In addition, she seems to have less energy compared to other babies and appears listless throughout the day. She was born by cesarean section to a G1P1 woman with no prior medical history and had a normal APGAR score at birth. Her parents say that she has never been observed to turn blue. Physical exam reveals a high-pitched holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following abnormalities?",A,"The symptoms and physical exam findings described in the case suggest that the infant may have a congenital heart defect. The presence of a high-pitched holosystolic murmur best heard at the lower left sternal border is characteristic of a ventricular septal defect (VSD), a common type of congenital heart defect. However, the question asks for the cause of the symptoms associated with the abnormality, not the specific diagnosis.

Among the options provided, 22q11 deletion (Option A) is known to be associated with an increased risk of congenital heart defects, particularly VSDs and tetralogy of Fallot. This deletion syndrome is also known as DiGeorge syndrome or velocardiofacial syndrome and can present with a variety of symptoms including cardiac defects, immunodeficiency, and developmental delays.

The other options (B through E) are not typically associated with the specific symptoms and findings described in the case. Deletions on chromosome 7 (Option B) can be associated with Williams syndrome, which has its own distinct set of symptoms and does not typically present with the specific murmur described. Lithium exposure in utero (Option C) can lead to Ebstein's anomaly, but not typically the murmur described. Maternal alcohol consumption (Option D) can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome, which can have a wide range of effects but does not specifically point to the murmur described. Retinoic acid exposure in utero (Option E) can lead to a variety of birth defects but is not specifically associated with the murmur described.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",D,"The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is D. Histoplasma capsulatum infection. The presence of a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae in the bronchoalveolar lavage using silver/PAS staining is characteristic of histoplasmosis. The patient's history of hiking in Mississippi, a region where Histoplasma capsulatum is endemic, further supports this diagnosis. The symptoms described, including fever, chills, cough, and chest discomfort, are consistent with histoplasmosis.

No wheezing is heard on repeat pulmonary examination. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The most appropriate next step in management would be to perform bronchoscopy (Option C). The child's sudden change in condition, becoming limp and lethargic, and the absence of wheezing on repeat pulmonary examination suggest the possibility of airway obstruction or a foreign body aspiration, which can be evaluated and treated with bronchoscopy.

The patient's neutrophils are examined in the laboratory and they fail to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test. Which of the following is most likely dysfunctional in this patient?",E,"The most likely dysfunctional component in this patient is E. Respiratory burst. The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test is used to assess the ability of neutrophils to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) as part of their respiratory burst mechanism, which is crucial for killing ingested microorganisms. The failure of neutrophils to react in the NBT test suggests a defect in the respiratory burst, which is often seen in conditions like chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). This defect impairs the ability of neutrophils to effectively kill certain bacteria and fungi, leading to recurrent infections as described in the patient.",Success

On physical examination, the boy is sitting and leaning forward in apparent respiratory distress with suprasternal and intercostal retractions. Auscultation reveals inspiratory stridor without wheezing. He has a frequent barking cough and a hoarse voice when he speaks. What is a chest X-ray likely to show?",E,"The symptoms described in the case are characteristic of croup, a common viral infection in children that affects the larynx, trachea, and bronchi. The ""cough-like-a-seal bark"" and hoarse voice are typical of croup, as is the high-pitched inspiratory noise, known as stridor. The respiratory distress, suprasternal and intercostal retractions, and the absence of wheezing also support this diagnosis.

On a chest X-ray, croup can present with specific signs. The ""steeple sign"" is a classic radiographic finding associated with croup. It is characterized by a narrowing of the subglottic airway, which appears as a tall, narrow triangle on the anteroposterior view of the neck or chest X-ray. This sign is caused by the inflammation and edema of the subglottic region, which is a hallmark of croup.

E. Steeple sign",Success
"A 26-year-old woman presents to a gynecologist after a missed period. After performing a complete physical examination and a screening test for pregnancy, her gynecologist informs her that she is pregnant. She is very surprised as she has been taking oral contraceptives regularly. When the gynecologist asks her about the consumption of any other medications, she mentions that she was placed on treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) 2 months ago. Her current anti-TB regimen includes rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient?",A,"The mechanism that best explains the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient is A. Induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin leading to decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone. Rifampin is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4, which is responsible for the metabolism of many drugs, including oral contraceptives. This induction results in increased metabolism and clearance of the contraceptive hormones ethinylestradiol and progesterone, leading to lower serum levels and reduced contraceptive efficacy.",Success

On abdominal exam you note diffuse tenderness to palpation without rebound or guarding. There are no masses, hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds are hyperactive. Ultrasound of the right lower quadrant is negative for appendicitis. Stool is guaiac positive. He receives 15mg/kg acetaminophen and fluids are started. The next day, he complains of lower extremity weakness and tingling. On repeat exam, lower extremity strength is 3/5 with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following lab findings would most likely be seen in this patient?",D,"The patient's presentation is consistent with a severe gastrointestinal infection with dehydration and possible sepsis, given his fever, hypotension, and signs of poor perfusion (dry mucous membranes). The development of lower extremity weakness and tingling suggests a neurological complication, which could be Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a post-infectious autoimmune disorder that can occur following certain infections, including gastrointestinal infections.

Given the context and the neurological symptoms, the most likely lab finding would be:

D. Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count

This is a characteristic finding in Guillain-Barré syndrome, where there is often an elevated protein level in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) without a significant increase in white blood cells (cytoalbuminologic dissociation).

The other options are less likely:
A. Gram stain positive CSF would suggest bacterial meningitis, which is not supported by the clinical presentation.
B. Peripheral eosinophilia is typically seen in parasitic infections or allergic reactions, which is not suggested by the case.
C. Xanthochromia on cerebrospinal fluid analysis is a sign of subarachnoid hemorrhage or chronic meningitis, not consistent with the patient's presentation.
E. Oligoclonal bands on cerebrospinal fluid analysis are typically seen in multiple sclerosis and not in the context of Guillain-Barré syndrome.",Success
A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the physician because of an inward turning of his left forefoot. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation by cesarean section because of breech presentation. The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios. Examination shows concavity of the medial border of the left foot with a skin crease just below the ball of the great toe. The lateral border of the left foot is convex. The heel is in neutral position. Tickling the lateral border of the foot leads to correction of the deformity. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the left foot shows an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?,D,"The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is likely option A, a foot abduction brace. The description given is consistent with a condition known as Congenital Talipes Equinovarus (CTEV), commonly known as clubfoot. The inward turning of the left forefoot, the concavity of the medial border, and the convexity of the lateral border are all indicative of this condition. The fact that the deformity corrects with stimulation (by tickling the lateral border of the foot) also supports this diagnosis, as clubfoot can often be somewhat flexible in newborns.

A foot abduction brace is typically used as part of the Ponseti method, which is the standard treatment for clubfoot. This method involves a series of casts to gradually correct the deformity, followed by the use of a brace to maintain the corrected position and prevent recurrence. The goal is to achieve a functional and stable foot without the need for invasive surgery.

Option B, osteotomy of the metatarsals, and option C, arthrodesis of the forefoot, are both surgical interventions that are typically considered only after non-surgical methods have failed or in cases of severe or rigid deformities. Given the description provided, the deformity appears to be flexible and correctable with stimulation, making these more invasive options less appropriate as a first line of treatment.

Option D, reassurance, is not sufficient as a management strategy for clubfoot, as untreated clubfoot can lead to significant functional impairment and pain later in life.

Option E, tarsometatarsal capsulotomy, is a surgical procedure that involves releasing tight structures in the foot. While it may be part of a surgical correction for clubfoot, it is not the first-line treatment for a newborn with a flexible clubfoot, as described in this case.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is the application of a foot abduction brace as part of the non-surgical treatment plan for clubfoot.",Success

Abdominal ultrasonography is performed, but the results are inconclusive. Cholescintigraphy shows the intrahepatic bile ducts, hepatic ducts, common bile duct, and proximal small bowel. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?""",E,"The patient's symptoms, including right upper abdominal pain, nausea, fever, and laboratory findings, suggest a possible biliary pathology. Given the patient's BMI, which is indicative of obesity, and the presence of right upper quadrant tenderness, the most likely cause of her symptoms is (E) Obstruction of the cystic duct, which can lead to acute cholecystitis. This condition is common in obese individuals and can be caused by gallstones blocking the cystic duct, leading to inflammation of the gallbladder.

The other options are less likely:
A. Autodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma would suggest acute pancreatitis, which typically presents with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, not necessarily confined to the right upper quadrant.
B. Hypomotility of the gallbladder could cause symptoms, but it is less likely to present with fever and the acute onset of symptoms as described.
C. A fistula between the gallbladder and small intestine is a rare complication of chronic gallbladder disease and would not typically present with the acute symptoms described.

A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the intensive care unit for shortness of breath and palpitations. A cardiac catheterization is performed and measurements of the left ventricular volume and pressure at different points in the cardiac cycle are obtained. The patient's pressure-volume loop (gray) is shown with a normal pressure-volume loop (black) for comparison. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?,C,"The pressure-volume loop you described for the 72-year-old woman shows characteristics that could be associated with multiple conditions listed in the options. However, without the actual graphical representation, I will infer based on typical changes seen in each condition.

A pressure-volume loop that shows an increase in end-diastolic pressure and volume, with a decreased slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, might suggest impaired left ventricular contractility (Option D). This is because impaired contractility leads to less efficient pumping of the heart, resulting in higher end-diastolic volumes as the heart tries to compensate by filling more. The decreased slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship indicates that the heart is less responsive to changes in volume, a characteristic of reduced contractility.

If the loop shows a decreased end-systolic volume with a normal or increased end-diastolic volume, it could suggest mitral valve regurgitation (Option A). This is because the regurgitation of blood back into the left atrium during systole leads to a decreased effective stroke volume, which can manifest as a lower end-systolic volume on the pressure-volume loop.

Increased systemic vascular resistance (Option B) would typically result in a pressure-volume loop with a higher end-systolic pressure, as the heart has to work harder against the increased resistance to pump blood out.

Increased ventricular wall stiffness (Option C) would lead to an increase in end-diastolic pressure for a given end-diastolic volume, as the ventricle is less compliant and cannot fill as easily.

Aortic stenosis (Option E) would manifest as an increased end-systolic pressure on the pressure-volume loop, as the heart has to generate higher pressures to overcome the obstruction at the aortic valve.

Given the symptoms of shortness of breath and palpitations, and assuming the pressure-volume loop shows features of diastolic dysfunction with increased end-diastolic pressure and volume, and reduced contractility, the most likely underlying cause would be impaired left ventricular contractility (Option D). This condition can lead to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, which would explain the patient's symptoms. However, without the actual graphical representation, this is an educated inference based on the typical changes seen in each condition.",Success

Vancomycin is a common antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial meningitis, especially when there is a concern for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or other Gram-positive bacterial infections. Given that the patient was treated for bacterial meningitis while in Guatemala, and considering the potential for drug-resistant bacteria, vancomycin would be a suitable choice for empirical therapy in such a setting.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"Given the patient's initial presentation and laboratory values, he likely suffered from Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA), a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. The initial treatment for DKA includes administration of insulin, intravenous fluids to correct dehydration, and monitoring and correction of electrolyte imbalances, specifically potassium levels, which can be dangerously low due to insulin administration and renal excretion.

After treatment, the patient's blood pressure, pulse, respirations, and oxygen saturation have normalized, and his laboratory values have improved significantly, with glucose levels in the normal range and potassium levels within the normal range. This indicates that the initial treatment was effective.

The best next step in management would be to continue supportive therapy and close monitoring (Option E). This includes monitoring for any recurrence of DKA, monitoring electrolyte levels, and ensuring the patient's overall stability. Given that the patient is a known IV drug abuser and attends a methadone clinic, additional considerations might include addressing his substance abuse and providing appropriate social and medical support.

Insulin and IV fluids may still be necessary if the patient's glucose levels begin to rise again or if he shows signs of dehydration or renal insufficiency. Potassium levels should also be monitored closely, as they can fluctuate rapidly in patients with DKA. However, at this point, the patient's laboratory values suggest that aggressive treatment with insulin, potassium, and IV fluids is no longer necessary, and a more conservative approach with close monitoring is appropriate.",Success

The combination of persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, and signs and symptoms suggestive of RSV pneumonia, along with failure to thrive (as indicated by weight in the 10th percentile), can be indicative of a primary immunodeficiency disorder. Since the HIV test was negative, we can look at other causes. Defective T cell function can lead to severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which can present with these symptoms due to the inability to fight off infections effectively.

Based on this study, which of the following represents the most likely therapeutic index for this novel chemotherapeutic agent?",E,"The therapeutic index is a measure of the safety of a drug, defined as the ratio of the dose that produces toxicity in 50% of the population (LD50) to the dose that produces a therapeutic effect in 50% of the population (ED50). However, in this question, we do not have the exact values for LD50 and ED50. Instead, we have to estimate the therapeutic index based on the given data.

First, let's determine the ED50, which is the dose that produces a therapeutic effect in 50% of the population. We can estimate this by looking at the doses where the improvement rate is closest to 50%. Based on the data provided, the 40 mg dose seems to be the closest to this criterion, with 46/51 patients demonstrating improvement, which is approximately 90%. The 30 mg dose has 26/53 patients demonstrating improvement, which is approximately 49%. Therefore, the ED50 is likely between the 30 mg and 40 mg doses. For the purpose of this question, we can estimate the ED50 to be 35 mg.

Next, let's determine the LD50, which is the dose that produces toxicity in 50% of the population. Based on the data provided, the 100 mg dose has 47/52 patients experiencing a treatment-related adverse event, which is approximately 90%. The 80 mg dose has 23/47 patients experiencing a treatment-related adverse event, which is approximately 49%. Therefore, the LD50 is likely between the 80 mg and 100 mg doses. For the purpose of this question, we can estimate the LD50 to be 90 mg.

Finally, we can calculate the therapeutic index by dividing the LD50 by the ED50:

Therapeutic Index = LD50 / ED50
Therapeutic Index = 90 mg / 35 mg
Therapeutic Index = 2.57

He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient’s two older siblings are both healthy. The patient’s temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 58/37 mmHg, pulse is 166/min, and respirations are 38/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress. His abdomen is firm and distended with hypoactive bowel sounds.

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this fetus’s presentation?",A,"The most likely etiology of this newborn's presentation is A. Duodenal atresia. The key features that suggest this diagnosis include the bilious vomiting and the absence of meconium passage. Duodenal atresia is a congenital obstruction of the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine, which can lead to bilious vomiting in the newborn period. The distended and firm abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds are also consistent with an intestinal obstruction. The other options listed (intestinal malrotation, meconium ileus, necrotizing enterocolitis, and pyloric stenosis) can also cause vomiting and abdominal distension, but the presence of bilious vomiting and the absence of meconium passage are most indicative of duodenal atresia.",Success

"A man is brought into the emergency department by the police department. The officer state that the man has been arrested multiple times for public alcohol intoxication, but recently became homeless. On exam, the man is behaving erratically. His vitals are all within normal limits. He appears confused and has a slurred speech. On gait exam, the patient is ataxic and cannot stand without support for more than a few seconds. Labs return with the following values: Na 140, K 4, Cl 106, BUN 8, Cr 2. His ABG has pH 7.3, PaCO2 13mm, PaO2 130mm, HCO3 7. His urinalysis is shown in Figure 1. Blood salicylate levels return as normal. While you await other diagnostic tests, which of the following should be administered next to treat this patient?",E,"The patient's symptoms and lab results are consistent with alcohol withdrawal and possible Wernicke's encephalopathy, which can occur in chronic alcoholics, especially those who are malnourished and homeless. The low bicarbonate (HCO3) and low PaCO2 indicate a metabolic acidosis, which is common in alcohol withdrawal. The patient's ataxia, confusion, and slurred speech also point to neurological involvement.

Given the context and the symptoms, the most appropriate initial treatment would be:

A. Ethanol

Ethanol can be used to treat alcohol withdrawal and prevent seizures. It also competes with methanol or ethylene glycol (if suspected) for alcohol dehydrogenase, preventing the formation of toxic metabolites. However, the use of ethanol is typically reserved for cases where the specific toxic alcohol is known or suspected, and in this case, there is no indication of methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning.

E. Fomepizole

Fomepizole is an alternative to ethanol for the treatment of methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning. It is an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor that prevents the conversion of toxic alcohols into their more harmful metabolites. However, there is no evidence from the given information that the patient has ingested methanol or ethylene glycol.

Since the patient's condition is most likely due to alcohol withdrawal and possible Wernicke's encephalopathy, the administration of thiamine (vitamin B1) would be the most appropriate next step. Thiamine is essential for carbohydrate metabolism and is often deficient in chronic alcoholics due to poor nutrition. Wernicke's encephalopathy is a neurological emergency resulting from thiamine deficiency and can present with confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. However, thiamine is not listed among the options provided.

Given the options provided, and without further information about the patient's history or other lab results, the most appropriate choice from the list would be:

A. Ethanol

This is because ethanol can help manage alcohol withdrawal symptoms and prevent seizures, which are common in severe alcohol withdrawal. However, it is important to note that the administration of thiamine should also be considered urgently in this case to address the potential thiamine deficiency and prevent the progression of Wernicke's encephalopathy.",Success
"A medical research study is evaluating an investigational novel drug (medication 1) compared with standard therapy (medication 2) in patients presenting to the emergency department with myocardial infarction (MI).

Endpoints Medication 1 Medication 2 P-Value
Primary: death from cardiac causes 134 210 0.03
Secondary: hyperkalemia 57 70 0.4
What is the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes? (Round to the nearest whole number.)",C,"To calculate the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), we first need to determine the absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the two groups for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes. The absolute risk reduction is calculated as the difference in event rates between the control group (Medication 2) and the treatment group (Medication 1).

The event rate for Medication 1 (treatment group) is:
\[ \frac{134}{1500} = 0.089333 \]

The event rate for Medication 2 (control group) is:
\[ \frac{210}{1500} = 0.14 \]

The absolute risk reduction (ARR) is:
\[ 0.14 - 0.089333 = 0.050667 \]

The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is the inverse of the absolute risk reduction, which means:
\[ NNT = \frac{1}{ARR} = \frac{1}{0.050667} = 19.738 \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the NNT is 20.

His only medication is metformin. His pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 170/92 mm Hg. Straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot. There is no pain in the back. His muscle strength is normal. Femoral pulses are palpable; right pedal pulses are absent. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is A. Femoropopliteal artery stenosis. The patient's symptoms of tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level, calf cramps during exercise that force him to take frequent breaks, and the absence of right pedal pulses are all indicative of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The fact that the pain completely disappears after resting for a few minutes is also consistent with intermittent claudication, a symptom of PAD. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and smoking are both risk factors for PAD. The straight leg raise test eliciting pallor and tingling pain in the right foot further supports this diagnosis. The normal muscle strength and absence of back pain make lumbar spinal stenosis less likely. The palpable femoral pulses and absence of pain in the back also make aortoiliac artery stenosis less likely. Vasculitis and acute thrombosis of the right popliteal vein are less likely given the chronic nature of the symptoms and the absence of other signs and symptoms typically associated with these conditions.",Success

Which of the following processes is involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining after damage to alveoli occurs?",D,"The process involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining after damage to alveoli occurs is:

D. Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells

After an injury to the alveoli, such as in the case of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), the alveolar lining is regenerated through the proliferation of type II alveolar cells, which are also known as surfactant-secreting cells. These cells are responsible for producing surfactant, a substance that reduces surface tension in the alveoli and prevents their collapse. In response to injury, type II cells can divide and differentiate into type I cells, which form the thin alveolar lining necessary for efficient gas exchange.",Success
A 65-year-old male is treated for anal carcinoma with therapy including external beam radiation. How does radiation affect cancer cells?,E,"The correct answer is E. Induces breaks in double-stranded DNA.

Radiation therapy works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, which can lead to cell death. One of the primary ways that radiation achieves this is by inducing breaks in the double-stranded DNA of cancer cells. This damage disrupts the ability of the cells to replicate and divide, effectively halting the growth of the tumor. While some of the other options listed (such as the formation of thymidine dimers) can be caused by other forms of DNA damage (e.g., ultraviolet light), the primary effect of radiation on DNA is the induction of double-stranded breaks.",Success
"A 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to his physician with progressive fatigue and new onset muscle cramps. He has had no recent changes to his medication regimen, which includes hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and amlodipine.

The patient's cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 138 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 3.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 33 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 129 mg/dL

What is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension?",A,"The patient's history of hypertension, along with his symptoms of fatigue and muscle cramps, and his laboratory values, particularly the low potassium level (hypokalemia), suggest a possible underlying cause related to aldosterone excess (Option A). Aldosterone is a hormone that regulates blood pressure by promoting sodium retention and potassium excretion in the kidneys. An excess of aldosterone can lead to hypertension and hypokalemia.

The patient's medications include a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) and an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril), which are commonly used to treat hypertension. However, the hypokalemia suggests that the diuretic may not be the sole cause of the potassium loss, as ACE inhibitors typically help to preserve potassium levels. The calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) is also used to treat hypertension but does not typically cause significant changes in electrolyte levels.

The patient's serum sodium and chloride levels are within normal limits, but his bicarbonate level is high, which could suggest metabolic alkalosis, a condition often associated with aldosterone excess. The BUN level is also slightly elevated, which could be related to decreased kidney perfusion due to hypertension.

Options B (catecholamine-secreting mass) and C (cortisol excess) could also potentially cause hypertension, but they are less likely in this case given the patient's symptoms and laboratory values. Catecholamine-secreting masses, such as pheochromocytomas, typically present with episodic hypertension and symptoms like palpitations, diaphoresis, and headaches. Cortisol excess (Cushing's syndrome) can also cause hypertension but is usually associated with other symptoms like weight gain, easy bruising, and glucose intolerance.

Option D (impaired kidney perfusion) could contribute to hypertension, but it is less likely to be the primary cause given the patient's medication regimen and the lack of significant abnormalities on his physical exam.

Option E (increased peripheral vascular resistance) is a common mechanism of hypertension but does not explain the specific symptoms and laboratory findings in this patient.

In summary, the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension, based on the given information, is aldosterone excess (Option A). Further evaluation, such as measuring aldosterone and renin levels, would be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.",Success

The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is within the normal range (80-100 fL), indicating that the red blood cells are of normal size. This information, combined with the patient's complaint of increased fatigability, suggests that she may have iron deficiency anemia, which is common during pregnancy due to increased iron demands.

To investigate the cause of her anemia, the most appropriate test would be:

A. Serum iron level

This test will help determine if the anemia is due to iron deficiency. Additionally, checking the serum ferritin level would also be beneficial as it is a more specific marker of iron stores in the body. However, among the given options, serum iron level is the most directly relevant initial test.

Transferrin (option C) can also be useful in assessing iron status, but it is not as specific as measuring serum iron levels directly. Serum B12 level (option B) and total bilirubin (option E) are not typically indicated for the investigation of iron deficiency anemia, unless there are other clinical indications suggesting vitamin B12 deficiency or hemolysis, respectively.

Insert a 'straight cath' into the patient's bladder. The patient's history of not passing urine since the surgery and the mention of discomfort in his abdomen and pelvis suggest the possibility of urinary retention. Urinary retention can occur after surgery, especially in elderly patients, due to the effects of anesthesia, immobility, or pain. The use of atropine and scopolamine, which are anticholinergic drugs, can also contribute to urinary retention by relaxing the bladder muscle. Inserting a straight catheter can help relieve the patient's discomfort and prevent complications such as bladder distension or renal damage.

However, for oral candidiasis, azoles, which inhibit the enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase, are typically used. This mechanism is represented by option C. Despite this, the question seems to be leaning towards the most effective antifungal mechanism for treating candidiasis, which would be the inhibition of beta-glucan synthase, although in practice, azoles are more commonly used for oral candidiasis.

The other options are not relevant to the treatment of fungal infections:

A. Disruption of cell membrane permeability - This is the mechanism of action of polyenes like amphotericin B, which are used for more severe fungal infections.
B. Disruption of microtubule formation - This is the mechanism of action of vinca alkaloids, which are used in chemotherapy for cancer.
E. Inhibition of squalene epoxidase - This is the mechanism of action of squalene epoxidase inhibitors, which are used as antifungal agents but are not the first choice for oral candidiasis.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is D. Inhibition of beta-glucan synthase, although for practical treatment of oral candidiasis, an azole with the mechanism of action represented by option C would be more commonly used.",Success
"A 56-year-old man presents to the clinic complaining of subacute back pain for the past month. The pain is described as a dull, constant ache that is worse at night. He could not recall any precipitating event except for an amateur weight-lifting competition that he participated in 2 months ago. Past medical history is significant for non-small cell lung cancer that was diagnosed and successfully treated. A PET scan 1 year ago demonstrated no recurrence. Physical exam was unremarkable except for some point tenderness along the lumbosacral area. What is the most likely imaging finding in this patient?",C,"The most likely imaging finding in this patient is C. Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine. Given the patient's history of non-small cell lung cancer, the subacute back pain, and the fact that the pain is worse at night, these symptoms could be indicative of metastatic disease to the spine. Lung cancer has a high propensity to metastasize to the bones, particularly the spine, and lytic lesions are a common finding in such cases.",Success
A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of severe abdominal pain and bilious vomiting for 6 hours. He has not had bowel movements in the past 24 hours. He appears ill. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F) and pulse is 122/min. Examination shows a distended abdomen. There is tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen; guarding and rebound tenderness are present. Bowel sounds are decreased. An x-ray of the abdomen shows dilated loops of bowel. He has been accompanied by his 14-year-old brother. The surgeon recommends an emergency laparotomy. The parents are away visiting friends and cannot be reached. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?,D,"In this situation, the most appropriate next best step in management is:

D. Perform emergency laparotomy

The child is clearly in a medical emergency with signs of a possible bowel obstruction or perforation, which can be life-threatening. Delaying treatment until parental consent can be obtained could result in significant harm or death. In cases where a child is in need of urgent medical care and the parents cannot be reached, medical professionals have the authority to proceed with necessary treatment under the doctrine of ""parens patriae,"" which allows the state to act in the best interest of the child. In this scenario, the surgeon can proceed with the emergency laparotomy without immediate parental consent. However, it is also advisable to document the situation and efforts made to contact the parents, and to seek legal advice if possible. Obtaining a court order (Option C) would take too much time and is not feasible in an emergency situation. Getting consent from the patient (Option B) or the patient's brother (Option A) is not legally valid as the patient is a minor and the brother is not a legal guardian. Delaying surgery until parental consent (Option E) is obtained is not an appropriate action given the urgency of the situation.",Success
"A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the hospital because of poor weight gain since birth. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation via normal vaginal delivery. He weighed 3005 g (6 lb, 10 oz) at birth and currently weighs 2835 g (6 lb, 4 oz). He has been latching on and breastfeeding well since birth. His mother has a history of Graves' disease and underwent near-total thyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy after her symptoms could not be controlled with antithyroid drugs. She is currently receiving L-thyroxine therapy. The patient's temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 176/min, and respirations are 42/min. He appears irritable. Examination shows a diaphoretic infant with a paucity of subcutaneous fat. There is swelling of the neck at the midline. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",C,"The most likely cause of the symptoms in this 3-week-old male newborn is C. Transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies. The infant's symptoms, including poor weight gain, irritability, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and a paucity of subcutaneous fat, are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The history of the mother's Graves' disease and near-total thyroidectomy during pregnancy, along with her current L-thyroxine therapy, suggests that she may have had high levels of TSH receptor antibodies that were transferred to the fetus across the placenta. These antibodies can stimulate the fetal thyroid gland, leading to hyperthyroidism in the newborn. The swelling of the neck at the midline is likely due to an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) in response to the stimulation by the TSH receptor antibodies.",Success
"A 57-year-old female with a past medical history of alcoholism presents to the emergency room vomiting bright red blood. She is accompanied by her partner, who reports that she had been complaining of black and tarry stools for the past several days. Vital signs are temperature 37 degrees celsius, heart rate 141 beats per minute, blood pressure 90/60, respiratory rate 20, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. On physical examination, she has splenomegaly and a positive fluid wave. The remainder of her examination is within normal limits. The patient is stabilized with intravenous fluids, and her blood pressure improves. Subsequent emergent upper endoscopy reveals bleeding from the submucosal veins in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus, but no gastric bleed. In the endoscopy suite she also receives IV octreotide. After intervention and resolution of her acute bleed, which of the following pharmacologic agents is indicated?",D,"The patient's presentation and endoscopic findings are consistent with esophageal varices, a common complication of cirrhosis in patients with a history of alcoholism. The bleeding from the submucosal veins in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus is indicative of this diagnosis. Octreotide, which she received in the endoscopy suite, is often used acutely to control bleeding from esophageal varices by reducing splanchnic blood flow and portal hypertension.

After the acute bleed has been controlled, long-term prophylaxis to prevent rebleeding is necessary. Beta-blockers, such as propranolol and nadolol (option D), are the first-line pharmacologic agents for the prevention of rebleeding from esophageal varices. They work by decreasing portal hypertension through systemic vasoconstriction and reducing the heart rate, which in turn decreases portal blood flow and pressure. Nadolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that does not have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and is often used in patients with liver cirrhosis because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier as easily as propranolol, potentially reducing the risk of precipitating hepatic encephalopathy.

Options A, B, C, and E are not typically used for the management of esophageal varices. Phentolamine (option A) and prazosin (option B) are alpha-adrenergic blockers used to treat hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia, respectively. Nifedipine (option C) is a calcium channel blocker used to treat angina and hypertension. Doxazosin (option E) is another alpha-adrenergic blocker used for hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia. None of these medications are indicated for the prevention of rebleeding from esophageal varices.",Success
"A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension, obesity, and alcoholic cirrhosis is seen in clinic for follow-up. He feels well and currently drinks 5 glasses of wine each night.

He has spider angiomata on his chest; no asterixis, jaundice, ascites, or peripheral edema is noted. Screening ultrasound reveals a new liver nodule, and follow up CT demonstrates a 2 cm right hepatic lobe lesion with enhancement in the arterial phase. No hypodense attenuation is seen on the venous or delayed phase. What is the next step in management?",A,"The next step in management for this patient with a new liver nodule and a history of alcoholic cirrhosis would be:

A. Proceed with liver biopsy

The patient's history of cirrhosis and the imaging findings are concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The CT scan shows enhancement in the arterial phase, which is a typical pattern for HCC. However, without hypodense attenuation on the venous or delayed phase, the lesion does not meet the typical radiological criteria for diagnosing HCC without a biopsy. Therefore, a liver biopsy is indicated to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment.

Options B, C, and D are potential treatment options for HCC, but they are not the next step before a diagnosis is confirmed. Option E, observing and getting follow-up imaging in 3 months, may be appropriate for indeterminate lesions or in patients with very small lesions where the risk of biopsy complications outweighs the benefits, but in this case, given the size of the lesion and the patient's history, a biopsy is warranted.",Success

An abdominal ultrasound shows surface nodularity compatible with cirrhosis but no other changes aside from ascites. An upper GI endoscopy is performed which shows gastric varices with no signs of active bleeding. An MRI of the brain is insignificant. What is the most likely precipitating factor that led to this patient’s condition?",A,"The most likely precipitating factor that led to this patient’s condition is A. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The patient's symptoms of abdominal distension, somnolence, and altered mental status, along with the physical examination findings of a distended abdomen, shifting dullness, and positive fluid wave, are consistent with ascites and possible infection. The patient's history of alcoholic liver cirrhosis also increases the risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The most likely diagnosis given the patient's history of a motor vehicle collision, the physical exam findings of chest wall bruising, and the laboratory findings of elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and troponins, is A. Cardiac contusion. This is a common injury in blunt chest trauma and can result in myocardial injury, which can manifest as chest pain and elevated troponin levels. The patient's sinus tachycardia is also consistent with a cardiac contusion. While pulmonary contusions and hemorrhage can also occur in motor vehicle collisions, the patient's normal oxygen saturation and lack of respiratory distress make these less likely. Myocardial infarction and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy are also less likely given the patient's young age and lack of risk factors for coronary artery disease.",Success
"A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department for progressively worsening fatigue, malaise, fever, and abdominal pain. He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications. Which of the following will be the best treatment option for this patient?",C,"The patient's presentation is consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) due to the positive ascitic fluid culture and elevated polymorphonuclear cell count. The development of oliguria and worsening renal function in the setting of fluid overload suggests the development of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a common complication in patients with cirrhosis and SBP. The patient's low urine sodium level without evidence of blood or protein in the urine further supports this diagnosis.

HRS is a functional renal failure that occurs in patients with advanced liver disease and portal hypertension. It is characterized by worsening renal function in the absence of intrinsic renal disease. The pathophysiology involves a systemic inflammatory response, leading to splanchnic arterial vasodilation and renal vasoconstriction, which ultimately results in renal failure.

The best treatment option for this patient is to address the underlying cause of HRS, which is the advanced liver disease. In this case, the patient has cirrhosis and a history of alcohol use disorder. Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for HRS and advanced liver disease. However, given that the patient is currently in the hospital with an acute illness and unstable hemodynamics, liver transplantation is not an immediate option. Instead, the patient should be stabilized and evaluated for potential candidacy for liver transplantation once his acute illness has resolved.

In the meantime, the patient should be managed with fluid restriction, diuretics, and vasopressors (such as terlipressin or norepinephrine) to improve renal function. Dopamine has been traditionally used as a vasopressor in HRS, but it has fallen out of favor due to its lack of efficacy and potential adverse effects. Lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is not indicated in this setting as it can worsen renal function in patients with HRS.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) is a procedure that can be used to treat HRS by decompressing the portal venous system and improving renal function. However, TIPS is typically reserved for patients who are not candidates for liver transplantation or as a bridge to transplantation.

Switching cefotaxime to ceftriaxone is not necessary as both antibiotics are effective against E. coli and the patient's culture is sensitive to both. The choice of antibiotic should be guided by the local antibiogram and the patient's clinical response to treatment.

In summary, the best treatment option for this patient is to stabilize his acute illness and evaluate him for potential candidacy for liver transplantation. In the meantime, he should be managed with fluid restriction, diuretics, and vasopressors to improve renal function. Dopamine, lisinopril, and TIPS are not indicated in this setting. Switching cefotaxime to ceftriaxone is not necessary as both antibiotics are effective against E. coli. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C. Liver transplantation (as the definitive treatment option once the patient is stabilized and evaluated for candidacy).",Success

B. Methimazole

Methimazole is an antithyroid medication that inhibits the production of thyroid hormones, making it an appropriate choice for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. It can help to normalize the patient's thyroid hormone levels and alleviate symptoms over time. Propranolol can be used to manage symptoms such as tachycardia, but it does not treat the underlying cause of hyperthyroidism.

Given the history and the nature of the rash, the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis would be:

C. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation

A KOH preparation involves scraping a small sample of the affected skin and examining it under a microscope after treatment with potassium hydroxide.

"A 59-year-old man is evaluated for progressive joint pain. There is swelling and tenderness over the first, second, and third metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands. His hand radiograph is shown. He has had diabetes mellitus for 2 years which is not well controlled with medications. Lab studies show a transferrin saturation of 88% and serum ferritin of 1,200 ng/mL. Which of the following best represents the etiology of this patient condition?",B,"The patient's symptoms, including joint pain, swelling, and tenderness, particularly affecting the metacarpophalangeal joints bilaterally, along with the radiographic findings, suggest a rheumatological condition. However, the additional information about his transferrin saturation of 88% and serum ferritin of 1,200 ng/mL points to a condition related to iron overload. These lab values are indicative of hemochromatosis, a disorder characterized by excessive iron absorption and deposition in various organs, including joints, which can lead to arthropathy.

The high serum ferritin and transferrin saturation levels are not typically seen in conditions like gout (option A), pseudogout (option B), or osteoarthritis (option C), which are more common causes of joint pain and swelling. These conditions do not typically present with such markedly elevated levels of iron-related markers.

Option D, an inflammatory rheumatological syndrome, could be considered given the joint symptoms, but the specific lab findings are more indicative of hemochromatosis, which can manifest with joint symptoms similar to inflammatory arthritis.

Option E, pathogenic inoculation of microbes, does not fit the clinical picture as there is no evidence of infection, and the symptoms and lab findings are more consistent with a chronic condition related to iron overload.

Therefore, the best representation of the etiology of this patient's condition is related to hemochromatosis causing arthropathy, which is not listed among the options provided. However, the closest option that could encompass this condition would be D, an inflammatory rheumatological syndrome, as hemochromatosis can present with inflammatory joint symptoms.

Physical exam reveals enlarged nodules that are not tender to palpation. A biopsy is obtained showing a characteristic change in chromosome 18. The regulation of which of the following proteins will be most abnormal in this patient?,B,"The characteristic change in chromosome 18 mentioned in the question is most likely referring to the t(14;18) translocation, which is a hallmark of follicular lymphoma. This translocation leads to the overexpression of the BCL-2 protein, which is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis (cell death). The BCL-2 protein is not listed among the options, but its overexpression is associated with the dysregulation of the apoptotic pathway, which involves caspases.

Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 are both involved in the apoptotic pathway, but Caspase-9 is more directly involved in the intrinsic pathway, which is the pathway that is dysregulated in follicular lymphoma due to the overexpression of BCL-2. BCL-2 inhibits the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, which is necessary for the activation of Caspase-9. Therefore, the regulation of Caspase-9 will be most abnormal in this patient.

PMR is often seen in conjunction with GCA and can present with symptoms similar to those described by the patient.

The other options do not fit as closely with the patient's presentation:
A. Uveitis is an inflammation of the uveal layer of the eye and is not typically associated with the symptoms described.
C. Heliotrope rash is a characteristic rash of dermatomyositis, which can cause muscle weakness but is less likely given the patient's intact muscle strength.
D. Gastroesophageal reflux is not typically associated with the symptoms described and would not explain the elevated inflammatory markers.
E. Pink plaques with silvery scales are characteristic of psoriasis, which is not typically associated with the symptoms described and would not explain the elevated inflammatory markers.",Success
"A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because she has been unable to conceive for 3 years. Analysis of her husband's semen has shown normal sperm counts during this time. The patient also reports episodic pelvic and back pain accompanied by painful diarrhea for 5 years. She has about one such episode on average per month for 4–6 days. She has taken ibuprofen for the pain, which has provided some relief. Menses have occurred at regular 29-day intervals since menarche at the age of 14 years and last for 7 days. She is sexually active with her husband and does not use contraception. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic and bimanual examinations are normal; rectal examination is unremarkable. A hysterosalpingogram 6 months prior showed normal results. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?",D,"The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms is D. Endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, which is a condition known as endometriosis. The episodic pelvic and back pain, accompanied by painful diarrhea, especially if these symptoms are worse during menstruation, are indicative of endometriosis. The fact that she has been unable to conceive for 3 years, despite her husband's normal sperm counts and her regular menstrual cycle, also points towards endometriosis as a possible cause of her infertility. Endometriosis can lead to adhesions and scar tissue that may affect the function of the fallopian tubes and other reproductive organs, leading to infertility.",Success
"A 55-year-old truck driver is brought to a physician by his wife. She states that her husband developed a fever and began feeling weak 3 days ago, but has refused medical help. He has been unable to go to work because of his symptoms. The patient has been previously hospitalized for a tricuspid valve replacement surgery 1 year ago and takes aspirin daily.

On examination, several hemorrhages are noted on the nail beds of several fingers. Which of the following findings would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis?",C,"The most helpful finding in establishing a diagnosis in this scenario would be:

C. Friable irregular masses attached to the valve

This finding is indicative of infective endocarditis, which is a possible diagnosis given the patient's history of tricuspid valve replacement, fever, and weakness. The presence of hemorrhages on the nail beds (Janeway lesions) is also consistent with this diagnosis.",Success
A previously healthy 30-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of pain during sexual intercourse for 6 months. She also reports frequent episodes of crampy pelvic pain that starts one day before menses and lasts for 7 days. Her symptoms are not relieved with pain medication. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 days. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with her husband. She uses a combined oral contraceptive pill. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows rectovaginal tenderness. Cervical and urethral swabs are negative. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,C,"The most appropriate next step in management for this patient is likely C. Laparoscopy. The patient's symptoms of pelvic pain and dyspareunia (pain during intercourse) that are not relieved with pain medication and the finding of rectovaginal tenderness during physical examination suggest a possible diagnosis of endometriosis. Laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis, as it allows for direct visualization of the pelvic cavity and any endometrial implants that may be present. It can also provide an opportunity for biopsy and therapeutic intervention if endometriosis is confirmed.

A. Measurement of CA-125 levels is not typically the first step in managing this condition, as elevated CA-125 levels are more commonly associated with ovarian cancer and other conditions, not specifically endometriosis.
B. Hysterectomy is a major surgical procedure and is not typically considered as a first-line treatment for pelvic pain or dyspareunia without a clear indication such as severe endometriosis or other serious conditions that cannot be managed with less invasive treatments.
D. Hysteroscopy is a procedure that allows for examination of the uterine cavity and is useful for diagnosing intrauterine conditions such as polyps or fibroids, but it does not address the extracavitary conditions that could be causing the patient's symptoms.
E. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is not typically the first diagnostic tool for pelvic pain and dyspareunia, as it is less sensitive for detecting endometriosis compared to laparoscopy and may expose the patient to unnecessary radiation.",Success
"A 50-year-old man visits his physician after 20 years of not seeking any medical care. He is concerned about his health after a colleague recently had a heart attack. The patient has no active complaints and says he feels healthy; however, he does not exercise regularly and lives a sedentary lifestyle. He is employed as an administrative position at a local college, and is seated at a desk most of the day.

"A 26-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was a restrained passenger. On arrival, she is lethargic and incoherent. She has severe facial lacerations and is in respiratory distress. Her pulse is 130/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 90/58 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. Examination shows multiple facial lacerations. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 12.1 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The most likely diagnosis in this scenario is B. Traumatic bronchial rupture. The x-ray findings of a fractured rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum are consistent with a bronchial rupture. The patient's respiratory distress, decreased breath sounds over the left lung base, and hypoxia also support this diagnosis.

Diaphragmatic rupture (Option A) would typically present with abdominal contents in the chest cavity on imaging, which is not described here. Thoracic aortic rupture (Option C) would likely present with more severe hemodynamic instability and could potentially show a widened mediastinum on imaging, but the other findings do not align with this diagnosis. Cardiac tamponade (Option D) would present with signs of Beck's triad (hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and jugular venous distension), which are not mentioned. Tension pneumothorax (Option E) could cause respiratory distress and hypotension, but the deviation of the nasogastric tube and depression of the bronchus are more specific to bronchial rupture.",Success
"A 26-year-old G1P0 woman presents to her primary care physician’s office with feelings of anxiety and trouble with sleep.

Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?",C,"The best treatment option for this patient is C. Propylthiouracil. This medication is preferred in the first trimester of pregnancy due to concerns that methimazole may be associated with a higher risk of fetal defects. Propylthiouracil is generally considered safer during the first trimester, although its use should be discussed with the patient and her obstetrician to weigh the risks and benefits. Radioiodine therapy and thyroidectomy are not appropriate treatment options during pregnancy due to potential harm to the fetus.

"A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of intermittent loose stools and a 1.2-kg (2.6-lb) weight loss. She immigrated to the US from Uganda 6 weeks ago. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. The liver is firm and palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpable just below the left costal margin. Her leukocyte count is 12,800/mm3 (12% eosinophils). Stool culture shows several oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines. Microscopic examination of a liver biopsy specimen shows granulomatous inflammation with periportal fibrosis. Exposure to which of the following is most likely to have played a role in the development of this patient's symptoms?",E,"The patient's symptoms, including intermittent loose stools, weight loss, diffuse abdominal tenderness, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and eosinophilia, along with the presence of specific eggs in the stool and granulomatous inflammation with periportal fibrosis in the liver biopsy, suggest a parasitic infection. The description of the eggs as oval-shaped with lateral spines is characteristic of the Schistosoma species, which is typically acquired through exposure to freshwater contaminated with the parasites shed by freshwater snails (Option E).

Schistosomiasis, caused by Schistosoma parasites, is a common disease in tropical and subtropical areas, including parts of Africa like Uganda. The infection occurs when people are exposed to contaminated freshwater, usually during bathing, washing, or swimming. The parasites penetrate the skin and mature inside the body, causing a range of symptoms including those experienced by this patient.

The other options do not fit the clinical presentation as well:

A. Tsetse flies transmit African trypanosomiasis, which does not typically present with the described symptoms or findings.

B. Undercooked pork meat can transmit Taenia solium or Trichinella spiralis, but these do not typically cause the specific findings of granulomatous inflammation with periportal fibrosis or the presence of the described eggs in the stool.

C. Undercooked fish meat can transmit parasites like Clonorchis sinensis or Opisthorchis species, which can cause liver disease, but the eggs of these parasites do not have lateral spines.

D. Dog feces can transmit Toxocara canis or other parasites, but these typically cause larva migrans or visceral larva migrans, not the specific findings in this patient's case.

Therefore, the most likely exposure that played a role in the development of this patient's symptoms is E. Freshwater snails.",Success
"A 3-month-old girl is brought to a pediatrician by her parents. She has central cyanosis without signs of respiratory distress or signs of heart failure.

B. Normal hemoglobin in patients with tetralogy of Fallot does not rule out iron deficiency anemia.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a congenital heart defect characterized by four abnormalities, including pulmonary stenosis (severe pulmonary outflow obstruction), ventricular septal defect (VSD), right ventricular hypertrophy, and overriding aorta, as described in the case. Iron deficiency anemia is common in patients with TOF due to chronic hypoxia and increased erythropoiesis. Normal hemoglobin levels do not exclude iron deficiency anemia, as the body compensates for the decreased oxygen-carrying capacity by increasing the production of red blood cells. This can lead to normal or even high hemoglobin levels, while the iron stores in the body may still be depleted.",Success

Delirium is a state of acute confusion and disorientation, often caused by an underlying medical condition or medication. The patient's symptoms, including agitation, confusion, and altered sleep-wake cycles, are characteristic of delirium. The use of oxycodone for pain, which is an opioid, can also contribute to the development of delirium, especially in elderly patients.

Down syndrome. The presence of a ""clunk"" when posterior force is applied to the head while anterior force is applied to the cervical spine suggests atlantoaxial instability, which is a known complication in individuals with Down syndrome due to ligamentous laxity in the cervical spine. The neurological symptoms and the positive Babinski sign could indicate compression of the spinal cord. While the other conditions listed (A, B, D, E) may have their own neurological complications, they are not as directly associated with atlantoaxial instability as Down syndrome. However, it is important to note that the patient's history of mental retardation does not specify Down syndrome, and further diagnostic imaging would be necessary to confirm the presence of atlantoaxial instability.",Success

Cardiovascular examination shows muffled heart sounds and jugular venous distention. Breath sounds are normal. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",C,"The patient's presentation and the physical examination findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of cardiac tamponade, which is an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space that compresses the heart and impairs its function. The muffled heart sounds and jugular venous distention are characteristic signs of tamponade, also known as Beck's triad, which also includes hypotension. The drop in systolic blood pressure during inspiration, known as pulsus paradoxus, is also a classic sign of tamponade and can be greater than 10 mmHg. Therefore, the correct answer is C. A drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration. This finding would be consistent with cardiac tamponade, which can be a life-threatening condition and requires immediate intervention, such as pericardiocentesis to relieve the pressure on the heart. Options A, B, D, and E are not consistent with the patient's presentation and are less likely to be found in this case.",Success

D. MR angiography of the brain

However, it's important to note that the renal ultrasound results are not provided in the question, which could potentially alter the answer. Assuming the renal ultrasound shows bilateral renal enlargement consistent with polycystic kidney disease (PKD), given the patient's family history and physical exam findings, the appropriate next step to screen for complications would indeed be to consider an MR angiography of the brain to screen for cerebral aneurysms, which are a known complication of PKD.

The other options are not as directly related to the complications of PKD or uncontrolled hypertension:

A. Colonoscopy is used to screen for colorectal cancer and is not typically indicated for complications of hypertension or PKD.
B. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is used to evaluate the upper gastrointestinal tract and is not typically indicated for the complications of hypertension or PKD.

Further testing shows a large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels, and the patient is started on an appropriate treatment intravenously. After drug administration, the effects of the drug are monitored using a standard blood test. Surprisingly, the test results come back within normal parameters. The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms has which of the following modes of inheritance?",A,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of a pulmonary embolism (PE), which is a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs. The presence of a large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels on imaging, along with the symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, and hemoptysis (coughing up blood), support this diagnosis. While the question asks about the mode of inheritance of the underlying cause of the symptoms, it's important to note that pulmonary embolisms can occur in individuals without a genetic predisposition and are often caused by factors such as immobility, surgery, trauma, or other conditions that cause blood clots.

However, some genetic conditions can predispose individuals to blood clotting disorders, which could increase the risk of developing a pulmonary embolism. One such condition is Factor V Leiden mutation, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern (Option A). This mutation increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Other clotting disorders, such as deficiencies in proteins C and S, or prothrombin gene mutation, can also be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

The other modes of inheritance listed (B, C, D, E) are less likely to be directly associated with an increased risk of pulmonary embolism, although it is possible that other genetic conditions with these patterns of inheritance could indirectly contribute to clotting disorders.

Given the information provided, the most likely answer to the question, based on the options given, would be:

A. Autosomal dominant

However, it is important to emphasize that while genetic factors can contribute to the risk of developing a pulmonary embolism, many cases occur without a clear genetic predisposition.",Success

Explanation: The organism described in the question is likely Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which is a common cause of urethritis and is characterized by the symptoms and laboratory findings mentioned. Gonorrhea can recur in the same individual due to antigenic variation, which allows the bacteria to evade the host's immune response by changing the structure of surface antigens.

In addition, an S3 heart sound is also present. Bounding pulses are palpated at the radial arteries bilaterally. Which of the following diagnoses is most likely in this patient?",C,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of Aortic Regurgitation (Option C). The presence of a diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border is characteristic of aortic regurgitation. The bounding pulses (also known as Corrigan's pulse) are also a classic sign of aortic regurgitation, as they reflect the increased volume of blood returning to the left ventricle during diastole and the subsequent increased force of ejection during systole. The presence of an S3 heart sound can indicate left ventricular failure, which can be a complication of severe aortic regurgitation. The midsystolic murmur heard at the right upper sternal border may be due to the increased flow through the aortic valve during systole, and the late diastolic rumbling murmur heard at the apex could be due to mitral valve dysfunction secondary to the volume overload caused by the aortic regurgitation.

Her family members describe her as being very impulsive and frequently acting to manipulate people’s feelings. Since she was admitted to the hospital, she has spit at several staff members and alternated between sobbing and anger. She has no significant past medical history. The patient denies any history of smoking, alcohol use, or recreational drug use. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The most likely diagnosis in this patient is B. Borderline personality disorder. The patient's history of impulsive behavior, turbulent relationships, attempts to manipulate others' feelings, and her emotional instability (alternating between sobbing and anger) are all characteristic of borderline personality disorder.

"A 50-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor following an inguinal hernia repair. The patient reports no pain in his lower abdomen or groin, no constipation, and states that he enjoys his usual diet. He denies any use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. He has returned to work as a cruise ship attendant. Preoperative workup included chest radiography which demonstrated an opacification in his right middle lobe. The patient agrees to undergo computed tomography (CT) of his chest without contrast for further evaluation. The radiologist reports an 8 mm nodule in the patient's peripheral right middle lobe that has regular margins and appears calcified. One year later, the patient obtains another chest CT without contrast that reports the nodule size as 10 mm with similar characteristics. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The most appropriate next step in management for the described patient with a growing pulmonary nodule would be:

A. CT chest without contrast in 12 months

The rationale for this decision is as follows:

1. **Nodule Characteristics**: The nodule is described as calcified and peripheral, which is less concerning for malignancy. Calcification within a nodule often suggests a benign etiology, such as granuloma or hamartoma.

2. **Nodule Size and Growth**: The nodule has grown from 8 mm to 10 mm over a year. While growth is a concern, the rate of growth is not alarming. Solid nodules that grow at a rate of less than 2 mm per year have a lower likelihood of being malignant.

3. **Follow-up Strategy**: For a nodule that has grown slightly but has benign characteristics, the recommended approach is often serial imaging to monitor for further changes. The Fleischner Society guidelines suggest a follow-up CT scan at 12 months for a nodule that has grown less than 2 mm in diameter.

4. **Consideration of Other Options**:
   - Option B (CT chest without contrast in 24 months) might be too long to wait given the growth of the nodule.
   - Options C (PET of chest now), D (Right middle lobectomy now), and E (Bronchoscopy-guided biopsy now) are more invasive and are typically reserved for nodules with more concerning features or faster growth rates.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to continue monitoring the nodule with a CT chest without contrast in 12 months, which balances the need for surveillance with the patient's risk and the characteristics of the nodule.",Success
"A 29-year-old man comes in for evaluation of infertility. He has been trying to conceive for over 2 years with his wife and previous evaluation of his wife's fertility revealed no abnormalities. Physical exam reveals a tall man with long extremities, sparse body hair, gynecomastia, and small testes. Laboratory studies reveal increased serum follicle-stimulating hormone concentration and an increased estradiol:testosterone ratio. Genetic studies reveal a cytogenetic abnormality. If this abnormality was inherited from the patient's father, at which stage of spermatogenesis did this error most likely occur?",A,"The cytogenetic abnormality in this case is most likely Klinefelter syndrome, which is characterized by an extra X chromosome (47,XXY). If this abnormality was inherited from the patient's father, it would have occurred during meiosis, the process of cell division that produces gametes (sperm and eggs). The error would have occurred in the primary spermatocyte during the first meiotic division when the sex chromosomes failed to separate properly (nondisjunction). Therefore, the correct answer is:

A. Primary spermatocyte",Success
"A 13-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with severe knee, hip, and groin pain. The patient has a past medical history notable only for obesity and asthma. His temperature is 98°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 124/65 mmHg, pulse is 128/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an inability of the patient to bear weight on his left leg and limited range of motion of the left hip. Which of the following is the best management for this patient?",E,"The best management for this patient is D. Surgical drainage of the hip. The patient's symptoms of severe knee, hip, and groin pain, along with the inability to bear weight on his left leg and limited range of motion of the left hip, are indicative of a possible hip joint infection, such as osteomyelitis or septic arthritis. These conditions are medical emergencies that require prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent serious complications, such as joint destruction and sepsis. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but this does not rule out a serious underlying condition. Imaging studies, such as X-rays and MRI, and laboratory tests, such as complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein, are needed to confirm the diagnosis. If a hip joint infection is suspected, surgical drainage of the hip joint is the preferred treatment to remove the infected material and reduce the inflammation and pain. Antibiotics are also necessary to treat the infection. Casting and crutches (A) and immobilization of the hip in a Pavlik harness (B) are not appropriate for a suspected hip joint infection. Supportive therapy and observation (C) are not sufficient for a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment. Surgical pinning of the femoral head (E) is not indicated for a hip joint infection.",Success
"A 28-year-old man comes to the physician because of diarrhea and crampy abdominal pain for 5 weeks. He has had up to 4 bowel movements per day.

This patient's condition is most likely associated with which of the following findings?",C,"The symptoms described, including chronic diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, mucoid strings in the stool, abdominal bloating, and significant weight loss, suggest a condition that is likely inflammatory in nature, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. The presence of a painful rash, which could be erythema nodosum, a common extraintestinal manifestation of IBD, further supports this diagnosis.

Given these symptoms and the lack of other symptoms such as fever, cough, or bloody stools, which would suggest other possible diagnoses, the most likely associated finding is:

C. Stool leukocytes

The presence of leukocytes in the stool is a common finding in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, indicating active inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. This would be a more direct indicator of the inflammatory process than the other options provided.

A. Mucosal lactase deficiency would be associated with lactose intolerance, which would not typically present with the symptoms described.
B. Increased serum VIP (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide) is associated with VIPoma, a rare tumor that can cause watery diarrhea but typically does not present with crampy abdominal pain or mucoid strings in the stool.

The patient is prescribed a drug to treat the cause of his current symptoms. The drug's mechanism of action directly involves which of the following signaling pathways?""",D,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest that he is suffering from anemia, which is common in patients with chronic kidney disease. The anemia is likely due to a deficiency in erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates the production of red blood cells. The drug that would be prescribed to treat this anemia is likely an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), such as epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa.

The mechanism of action of these drugs involves the activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. ESAs bind to erythropoietin receptors on the surface of erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow, leading to the activation of JAK kinases. Activated JAK kinases then phosphorylate and activate STAT proteins, which translocate to the nucleus and promote the transcription of genes involved in erythropoiesis, including the genes for globin chains and enzymes involved in heme synthesis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. JAK/STAT.",Success
"A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of muscle cramping, decreased appetite, and diarrhea.

The patient's lab results show a metabolic acidosis, indicated by the low bicarbonate (HCO3-) level and the low pH. The low pCO2 suggests a compensatory respiratory response to the metabolic acidosis. Metformin, when used in patients with certain risk factors such as renal impairment, can lead to lactic acidosis, a condition characterized by an accumulation of lactic acid and a decrease in blood pH.

Neurological examination shows decreased strength in the right lower leg with normal strength in the other extremities. Fundoscopic examination shows several multinodular, calcified lesions in the retina bilaterally. A photograph of his skin findings is shown. This patient's condition is most likely due to a mutation in which of the following?",D,"The patient's symptoms and findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), which is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of non-cancerous tumors in multiple organs, including the brain, skin, heart, kidneys, and lungs. The presence of calcified subependymal nodules seen on fundoscopic examination, along with the skin findings (which are not described in detail but likely include ash-leaf spots, shagreen patches, or adenoma sebaceum), and the cardiac rhabdomyoma (holosystolic murmur) are all features of TSC. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D. TSC1 gene on chromosome 9

The TSC1 gene, along with the TSC2 gene on chromosome 16, are responsible for Tuberous Sclerosis Complex. Mutations in either of these genes can lead to the development of the disorder.

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's laboratory derangements?",D,"The patient's laboratory values show an elevated creatinine level (3.1 mg/dL), which is indicative of renal dysfunction. This is particularly concerning given the patient's history of diabetic nephropathy. Among the medications listed, acyclovir (option A) is known to potentially cause acute renal failure, especially in patients with pre-existing renal disease. Acyclovir is eliminated by the kidneys and can precipitate in the renal tubules, leading to acute tubular necrosis and renal failure.

The patient's other laboratory values also suggest a metabolic acidosis (low HCO3- at 11 mEq/L), which can be associated with renal failure. While metformin (option D) can cause lactic acidosis in patients with renal impairment, the presence of renal dysfunction as indicated by the creatinine level makes acyclovir the more likely culprit for the combination of renal failure and metabolic acidosis in this patient.

Therefore, the most likely etiology of this patient's laboratory derangements is acyclovir (option A).",Success

A positive PPD (purified protein derivative) skin test with 17 mm of induration in a healthcare worker (such as a nurse) is indicative of a significant exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB). While the patient does not exhibit any symptoms of active TB disease, such as cough, shortness of breath, or weight loss, the positive PPD test suggests a latent TB infection (LTBI).

Latent TB infection does not cause symptoms and is not contagious, but it can progress to active TB disease, which is contagious and can be severe. Treatment of LTBI with isoniazid (INH) or other appropriate medications can significantly reduce the risk of developing active TB disease.

The son reports that the patient was in her usual state of health until she complained of chest palpitations. This startled her while she was climbing down the stairs and lead to a fall. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Medications are lisinopril, metoprolol, and warfarin. Temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 152/96 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 12/min, and pulse oximetry is 98% on room air. On physical examination, she is disoriented and at times difficult to arouse, the left pupil is 6 mm and non-reactive to light, and the right pupil is 2 mm and reactive to light. A right-sided visual field defect is appreciated on visual field testing. There is 1/5 strength on the right upper and lower extremity; as well as 5/5 strength in the left upper and lower extremity. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head is shown. Which of the following most likely explains this patient’s symptoms?",A,"The patient's symptoms, including the unequal and non-reactive pupils, the right-sided visual field defect, and the weakness on the right side of the body, along with the CT scan results, suggest a significant intracranial event. The left pupil being 6 mm and non-reactive to light, while the right pupil is 2 mm and reactive, is indicative of a condition known as a ""blown pupil,"" which can occur in cases of increased intracranial pressure and brain herniation. The right-sided visual field defect and the weakness on the right side of the body suggest a left-sided lesion.

The CT scan is not provided in the question, but assuming it shows a left-sided intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect, the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms is:

A. Herniation of the uncus

The uncus is a part of the temporal lobe that can herniate through the tentorial notch due to increased pressure in the left hemisphere, compressing the brainstem and cranial nerves. This can result in the symptoms described, including the unequal pupils (anisocoria) and right-sided weakness. The uncus contains the oculomotor nerve (CN III), which is responsible for pupil constriction and eye movement, and compression of this nerve can lead to a dilated, non-reactive pupil on the side of the lesion (in this case, the left side).",Success
"A 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after the results of serum protein electrophoresis showed monoclonal gammopathy. A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Which of the following best describes this class of immune cells?",D,"The class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation, as described in the question, is best represented by option D: Natural killer cells. Natural killer (NK) cells are a type of lymphocyte that can recognize and kill virus-infected cells and tumor cells without prior sensitization. They play a critical role in the innate immune response and are known for their ability to lyse target cells directly, without the need for antibodies or prior sensitization.",Success
"A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive muscle weakness for five months. She feels that the muscles in her shoulders and hips have been getting weaker and sometimes feel sore. She now has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. She has also noticed new difficulty with swallowing solid foods, but has no trouble with liquids. She has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia controlled with fluvastatin. Her maternal uncle died at age 26 from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and her mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurologic examination shows moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:

Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""",A,"The most likely option to confirm the diagnosis in this case is C. Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy. The patient's symptoms of progressive muscle weakness, particularly in the shoulders and hips, difficulty in swallowing solid foods, and the laboratory findings of elevated creatine kinase, suggest a diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy, specifically polymyositis or dermatomyositis. The perifascicular and perivascular infiltration seen on muscle biopsy is characteristic of these conditions. The patient's history of hyperlipidemia and the family history of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and Hashimoto's thyroiditis may be coincidental but do not directly point to the diagnosis of an inflammatory myopathy.

"A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency room with sudden onset of blurry vision one hour ago. He states that he was resting at home when he noticed he had difficulty reading. Currently, he is also starting to see double, and is seeing two images on top of each other. Earlier today, he felt ill with nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, which he attributed to food he had eaten at a picnic the day before. When asked which foods he ate, he lists potato salad, a hamburger, deviled eggs, and pickles made by his neighbor. He also heard that his friend who went to the picnic with him has developed similar symptoms and was seen in another hospital earlier. While in the emergency room, the patient’s temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), pulse is 75/min, blood pressure is 122/84 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Cranial nerve exam is notable for fixed pupillary dilation, and difficulty depressing both eyes. The remainder of his exam is normal. Which of the following is the pathogenesis of this patient’s presentation?",A,"The patient's presentation is most consistent with botulism, which is caused by the ingestion of preformed botulinum neurotoxin. The toxin is produced by Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that can grow in improperly canned or preserved foods, such as the ones the patient consumed at the picnic. The pathogenesis of botulism involves the botulinum neurotoxin inhibiting the release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions and autonomic ganglia. This leads to a flaccid paralysis and autonomic dysfunction, which can manifest as the symptoms described by the patient, including blurry vision, double vision, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A. Decreased acetylcholine release",Success
"A 4-week-old female newborn is brought to the physician because of increasing yellowing of her eyes and skin for 2 weeks. The mother has noticed that the girl's stools have become pale over the past week.

"A 43-year-old man comes to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and progressive perioral numbness for the past 24 hours. 3 days ago, he underwent a total thyroidectomy for treatment of papillary thyroid cancer. His only medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes a spasm in the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck. Which of the following ECG findings are most likely in this patient?",B,"The symptoms and the recent history of a total thyroidectomy suggest that the patient may be experiencing hypocalcemia, which is a common complication after thyroid surgery due to damage or removal of the parathyroid glands. Hypocalcemia can cause symptoms such as perioral numbness, muscle cramps, and spasms, including the observed hand spasm (known as Chvostek's sign). Among the ECG findings listed, the most likely to be associated with hypocalcemia is:

B. QT prolongation

Hypocalcemia can lead to prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG, which can increase the risk of arrhythmias such as torsade de pointes. However, torsade de pointes itself (option A) is not a typical ECG finding in hypocalcemia but rather a potential complication of QT prolongation. Options C, D, and E are not typically associated with hypocalcemia. U waves can be associated with hypokalemia, peaked T waves with hyperkalemia, and PR prolongation with various conditions including conduction system abnormalities but not specifically with hypocalcemia.",Success

A 55-year-old man with a history of chronic glomerulonephritis due to IgA nephropathy presents to your office with bone pain. Which of the following laboratory findings would you most expect upon analysis of this patient's serum?,A,"A. Increased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, decreased calcitriol

In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), such as this patient with chronic glomerulonephritis due to IgA nephropathy, the kidneys' ability to regulate electrolytes and hormones becomes impaired. This can lead to a disturbance in calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D metabolism, which can result in secondary hyperparathyroidism (increased PTH). The PTH increase is the body's attempt to correct the low calcium levels (hypocalcemia) by increasing bone resorption and renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. At the same time, the increased PTH also leads to increased phosphate excretion in the urine, but in the setting of CKD, the phosphate levels in the blood can still be elevated (hyperphosphatemia) due to decreased renal clearance. Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3), which is essential for calcium absorption in the gut, is produced by the kidneys and its levels are often decreased in CKD, contributing to the hypocalcemia.",Success
"A medical researcher is studying the physiology of the immune system in order to better understand the effects of HIV on patients. He isolates a group of cells that are shown by flow cytometry to be positive for the cell surface marker CD8. He then mixes this cell population with a group of infected cells, crosslinks extracellular interactions, and immunoprecipitates the CD8 protein. He identifies a protein bound to CD8 that is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell. Which of the following best describes the primary function of the protein that was most likely identified?",C,"The protein that was most likely identified in this experiment is the Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC I) molecule. MHC I molecules are composed of two chains: a heavy chain (the MHC I molecule itself) and a beta-2 microglobulin light chain. They are responsible for presenting endogenous peptides (peptides derived from proteins synthesized within the cell) to CD8+ T cells. The peptides presented by MHC I are often derived from intracellular pathogens (like viruses) or from damaged or mutated proteins within the cell. These peptides are transported to the endoplasmic reticulum by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) channel, where they are loaded onto MHC I molecules. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C. Binds endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel.",Success
"A 61-year-old Caucasian male presents to your office with chest pain. He states that he is worried about his heart, as his father died at age 62 from a heart attack.

What is the most likely cause of this patient's pain?",D,"The most likely cause of this patient's chest pain, given the provided information, is:

D. Gastroesophageal junction incompetence

The patient's symptoms of chest pain worsening with large meals and spicy foods and improving with calcium carbonate (an antacid) suggest a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This condition is characterized by the backward flow of stomach acid into the esophagus, which can cause heartburn and chest pain. The improvement with antacids further supports this diagnosis, as they neutralize stomach acid.

C. Reassuring the parents and use of an enuresis alarm

The child's history and physical examination do not suggest any serious underlying medical condition. The lack of daytime incontinence, urgency, frequency, or hesitancy, along with a normal neurological and abdominal exam, and a negative urine culture, suggest that the bedwetting is likely primary nocturnal enuresis, which is common in children of this age. The use of an enuresis alarm can help in training the child to respond to bladder fullness at night.

"A 52-year-old man with a history of gastric cancer that was treated with subtotal gastrectomy dies in a motor vehicle collision. At autopsy, examination of the spinal cord shows unilateral atrophy of the neurons in the area indicated by the arrow. Neurological examination of the patient when he was still alive would most likely have shown which of the following findings?",D,"The area indicated by the arrow in the spinal cord is not described, but based on the options provided, we can infer that the question is likely referring to a lesion in the dorsal columns or lateral columns of the spinal cord. The dorsal columns carry sensory information regarding fine touch, vibration, and proprioception, while the lateral columns carry information regarding pain, temperature, and crude touch.

Given that the question mentions atrophy of neurons in the spinal cord, it suggests a chronic lesion. The dorsal columns are particularly susceptible to such lesions, and a unilateral lesion would affect the ipsilateral leg and contralateral arm due to the decussation (crossing over) of the dorsal column-medial lemniscal pathway at the level of the medulla.

Option D, ""Decreased positional sense in the ipsilateral leg,"" is the most likely finding because the dorsal columns carry proprioceptive information, including position sense, from the ipsilateral side of the body. This information would be diminished or lost on the side of the lesion (ipsilateral leg) due to the damage to the neurons in this pathway.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

D. Decreased positional sense in the ipsilateral leg.",Success
"A 24-year-old pregnant woman at 28 weeks gestation presents to the emergency department with complaints of fever with chills and pain in her knee and ankle joints for the past 2 days.

Past medical history is noncontributory. She takes a multivitamin with iron and folate every day and has been receiving regular prenatal care and the pregnancy is progressing normally. On examination, an erythematous rash is seen on her right arm, as shown in the accompanying photograph. Her obstetric examination is normal. Ultrasound of the fetus is reassuring with a normal heartbeat and no gross abnormalities. A specimen is collected to test for Lyme disease. What is the next best step for this patient?",D,"The next best step for this patient is to treat her with Doxycycline (Option B). Lyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted by ticks, and the erythematous rash described in the patient's presentation is consistent with erythema migrans, a characteristic sign of Lyme disease. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice for Lyme disease in adults and is considered safe to use in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. However, it should be noted that tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are generally avoided in pregnancy due to potential harm to the fetus, including tooth discoloration and skeletal abnormalities. However, in the case of Lyme disease, the benefits of doxycycline treatment may outweigh the risks, and it is often used under the guidance of an infectious disease specialist or obstetrician. Alternative antibiotics that are considered safer in pregnancy, such as amoxicillin, could also be used, but in this scenario, doxycycline is the most appropriate choice given the options provided. Ibuprofen (Option A) would be used for symptomatic relief of pain and fever but is not an appropriate treatment for Lyme disease. Tetracycline (Option C) is not recommended in pregnancy.

Serum cortisol 30 µg/mL (5-23 µg/dL)
Serum adrenocorticotropin-releasing hormone (ACTH) 2 pg/mL (> 5 pg/mL)

A 48-hour high dose dexamethasone suppression trial shows that her serum cortisol levels do not decrease. What is the best next step in management?",A,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by excessive cortisol production. The high serum cortisol levels, the lack of suppression with high-dose dexamethasone, and the low ACTH levels suggest an ectopic ACTH-producing tumor rather than a pituitary adenoma or adrenal adenoma. The next step in management should be to locate the source of the ectopic ACTH production.

Option A, an MRI of the adrenal glands, is less likely to be helpful in this scenario because the low ACTH levels suggest that the source of the problem is not the adrenal glands themselves but rather an ectopic source of ACTH production.

Option B, an MRI of the chest, is a reasonable choice because ectopic ACTH-producing tumors are often found in the thoracic region, particularly in small cell lung cancer, which is more common in smokers.

Option C, an MRI of the pituitary gland, is less likely to be helpful because the low ACTH levels suggest that the source of the problem is not the pituitary gland.

Option D, a low dose dexamethasone suppression test, has already been implied to be non-diagnostic in this case since the high dose dexamethasone suppression test was non-suppressive.

Option E, inferior petrosal sinus sampling, is a more invasive procedure used to differentiate between pituitary and ectopic ACTH production. Given that the patient's ACTH levels are low, this test is less likely to be helpful in localizing the source of ectopic ACTH production.

Therefore, the best next step in management would be Option B, an MRI of the chest, to look for an ectopic source of ACTH production, such as a small cell lung cancer or another thoracic tumor.",Success

However, among the options provided, the most specific finding for minimal change disease, which is the likely diagnosis here, would be the effacement of foot processes of podocytes, which can only be seen on electron microscopy, not light microscopy. 

Since the question asks for the most likely finding on a renal biopsy and option E incorrectly specifies light microscopy, the next best choice based on the information provided would be:

A. Mesangial proliferation on light microscopy

This is because mesangial proliferation can be seen in a variety of glomerulonephritis conditions, including post-infectious glomerulonephritis, which can occur after a streptococcal infection (such as a sore throat) and may present with proteinuria and edema.

His temperature is 98.1°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 162/103 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an elderly man who laughs inappropriately at times and who is a poor historian. When he is engaged in conversation, he exhibits word finding difficulty and is rather inattentive. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is B. Frontotemporal dementia. The patient's symptoms, which include inappropriate behavior, personality changes, and language difficulties, are characteristic of frontotemporal dementia, particularly the behavioral variant. The worsening memory and trouble caring for himself are also consistent with this diagnosis, although these symptoms can be present in other forms of dementia as well. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, which does not point to an acute medical condition causing the symptoms. While other forms of dementia such as Alzheimer's (Option A) and Lewy body dementia (Option D) can present with memory loss, the initial and prominent behavioral changes suggest frontotemporal dementia. Vascular dementia (Option E) is typically associated with a stepwise decline in cognitive function related to cerebrovascular events, which does not seem to be the case here.

"A 75-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her son because of a 2-day history of fever, headache, malaise, and dry cough. The patient lives with her son and his family and her son reports that other members of the family have had similar symptoms during the past week but that he has not had any symptoms. The result of a polymerase chain reaction test confirms that the woman is infected with a virus that has a helical capsid and a segmented genome. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the son being free of symptoms?",A,"The most likely explanation for the son being free of symptoms is Option D: Homozygous mutation in the CCR5 gene. However, this explanation is specific to HIV infection, which is not the case here since the patient is infected with a virus that has a helical capsid and a segmented genome, which is characteristic of influenza viruses. The correct answer should be related to immunity against influenza.

Given the context and the options provided, the answer that is most relevant to immunity against influenza is Option A: Serum antibodies against hemagglutinin. Hemagglutinin is a surface protein of the influenza virus, and antibodies against it can provide immunity by preventing the virus from binding to and entering host cells.

This patient is at greatest risk for developing which of the following complications?",A,"The patient's symptoms and the genetic analysis result suggest a diagnosis of lipoprotein lipase deficiency, which is a disorder caused by mutations in the LPL, APOC2, APOA5, or LMF1 genes. Among these, a mutation in the APOC2 gene is consistent with the diagnosis of lipoprotein lipase deficiency due to the lack of an essential cofactor for the enzyme. This condition leads to the accumulation of chylomicrons in the blood, resulting in lipemia and the characteristic ""milky"" appearance of the blood sample. The creamy supernatant layer that appears after refrigeration is due to the separation of the triglyceride-rich chylomicrons.

Among the given options, acute pancreatitis (Option A) is the most likely complication in this patient. Elevated levels of triglycerides, as seen in lipoprotein lipase deficiency, can lead to acute pancreatitis due to the accumulation of lipids in the pancreas, causing inflammation and tissue damage. The other options, such as myocardial infarction, corneal arci, cholesterol embolization syndrome, and cerebrovascular accident, are typically associated with other types of dyslipidemias or atherosclerosis, rather than lipoprotein lipase deficiency.",Success

"A 5-year-old boy of African descent is presented to the emergency department by his parents. The child is clutching his abdomen and crying about pain in his belly. His mother reports intermittent episodes of jaundice with joint and bone pain since he was 5 months old. At presentation, the patient’s vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals slight jaundice and pale conjunctiva. The spleen is tender and easily palpable. After a complete blood count with differential and an abdominal ultrasound, the patient is found to have sickle-cell disease with splenic infarct. A partial splenectomy is performed. After the operation, the physician provides vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The picture shows a slide obtained from the resected portion of the patient’s spleen. Dysfunction of the zone marked with which number predisposes the patient to the aforementioned infections?",D,"The spleen plays a critical role in the body's defense against encapsulated bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The spleen filters the blood and contains specialized areas where immune cells can detect and respond to pathogens. In the context of the provided information and the image, the numbers on the slide likely represent different zones of the spleen.

The spleen is composed of two main types of tissue: red pulp and white pulp. The white pulp is the site of immune cell activity and is further divided into periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths (PALS), which are rich in T cells, and lymphoid follicles, which contain B cells. The red pulp consists of splenic cords and sinuses, where macrophages filter the blood for pathogens.

The image is not provided, but assuming that the numbers correspond to the typical structure of a spleen, we can infer the following:

1. This number could represent the white pulp, which includes the lymphoid follicles and PALS. These areas are critical for the immune response to encapsulated bacteria.

2. This number could represent the red pulp, which is where macrophages filter the blood and remove old or damaged red blood cells, as well as pathogens.

3. This number could represent the marginal zone, which is a transitional area between the white and red pulp. The marginal zone contains a variety of immune cells and is an important site for the initial capture and processing of blood-borne pathogens.

In sickle-cell disease, the spleen can become dysfunctional due to the abnormal shape of red blood cells, which can lead to infarction and atrophy. This dysfunction can affect all areas of the spleen, including the white pulp, red pulp, and marginal zone. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is:

E. 1, 2, and 3

All areas of the spleen play a role in the immune response to encapsulated bacteria, and dysfunction in any of these zones can predispose the patient to infections by these pathogens.",Success

On physical exam, she has tender parotid glands bilaterally and dries mucous membranes. The presence of serum anti-Ro and anti-La autoantibodies is confirmed at high titers. In addition to her primary diagnosis, which of the following is this patient most at risk for developing in the future?",B,"The patient's symptoms of dry mouth and dry eyes, along with the presence of tender parotid glands and high titers of anti-Ro and anti-La autoantibodies, are indicative of Sjögren's syndrome. Among the options given, patients with Sjögren's syndrome are at increased risk for developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Option B). This is the correct answer.

Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of exocrine glands, leading to dry mouth and dry eyes. The presence of anti-Ro (SSA) and anti-La (SSB) autoantibodies is highly specific for Sjögren's syndrome. While the condition can be associated with an increased risk of several malignancies, non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the most commonly associated cancer. This is due to the chronic immune activation and inflammation that occurs in Sjögren's syndrome, which can lead to the development of lymphoproliferative disorders over time.",Success

"A type of fatal adrenal cancer has an average survival rate of 3 years after the onset of clinically significant symptoms. It is determined that patients have a 4-year asymptomatic period prior to developing clinical symptoms from this adrenal cancer. A new screening test is developed, and the cancer can now be detected 2 years prior to developing clinical symptoms. A new observational case-control study of screened and unscreened patients measures the median 5-year survival of patients who decline medical and surgical treatment. The screened population has statistically better outcomes. Which step should be undertaken to prevent bias in these conclusions?",B,"The correct answer is B. Using mortality rates in the analysis.

Explanation: The use of survival rates can be misleading in this scenario due to lead time bias. Lead time bias occurs when the apparent survival time is increased simply because the disease is detected earlier, not because the treatment or disease process has changed. In this case, the screening test detects the cancer 2 years earlier, which could artificially inflate the survival rate of the screened population. To avoid this bias, the study should use mortality rates, which measure the number of deaths within a specific time period, rather than survival rates, which measure the time from diagnosis to death.

"A 38-year-old G4P3 presents to her obstetrician’s office for her 20-week anatomy ultrasound. She reports that she feels well and has not experienced any contractions or vaginal bleeding. She also reports good fetal movement. The patient declined prenatal screening earlier in the pregnancy for religious reasons but would now like an anatomy ultrasound to ensure the fetus is growing appropriately. The patient’s previous pregnancies were uncomplicated, and she delivered three healthy babies at full term. On the ultrasound, the technician observes a male fetus with likely intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). She also notes microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, and clenched fists with overlapping fingers. The technician further notes a medium-sized ventricular septal defect (VSD). The amniotic fluid index (AFI) is 26 cm.

Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be observed in this fetus?",D,"Based on the described ultrasound findings, the fetus is exhibiting features consistent with a condition known as Potter sequence or Potter syndrome, which is often associated with renal agenesis or severe oligohydramnios. However, the AFI of 26 cm suggests polyhydramnios, which is not typically seen in Potter sequence. The features mentioned, such as microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and a ventricular septal defect (VSD), do not specifically point to any of the options given as the most likely additional finding. However, among the options provided, option B, epicanthal folds, is a common finding in several genetic syndromes and could potentially be associated with the constellation of findings in this fetus, although it is not specific to any of the conditions directly related to the findings described.

Given the complexity of the findings and the potential for multiple anomalies, it would be important to conduct further genetic testing and evaluation to determine the specific diagnosis. However, if we must choose from the options provided, epicanthal folds (option B) might be the most likely additional finding to be observed in this fetus, although it is important to note that none of the options are directly indicative of the conditions described in the ultrasound findings. A comprehensive evaluation by a geneticist or a fetal medicine specialist would be necessary to provide a more accurate diagnosis.",Success
"An 83-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with fever, weakness, and decreased responsiveness. He is diagnosed with urosepsis based on urinalysis and culture and started on ceftriaxone and intravenous fluids. By hospital day 3, he is clinically improving. During the evening, the patient becomes irritable. He is talking to someone despite nobody being present in the room. He is easily agitated and attempts to strike a nurse with a remote control to his TV. Subsequently, the patient keeps getting out of bed and trying to walk away despite being a fall risk. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The patient's symptoms suggest he may be experiencing delirium, a common complication in elderly patients, especially those with infections or other acute medical conditions. Delirium can manifest as altered mental status, agitation, and disorientation. The first step in managing delirium is to address the underlying cause, which in this case is likely the urosepsis. However, given that the patient's infection is being treated and he is still exhibiting symptoms, the next step would be to manage his delirium.

Among the options provided, olanzapine (Option C) is an atypical antipsychotic that can be used to manage delirium in hospitalized patients. It has a lower risk of causing extrapyramidal side effects compared to typical antipsychotics and can help control agitation and delirium symptoms.

Diphenhydramine (Option A) is an antihistamine that can cause sedation but is not typically used for delirium management due to its anticholinergic properties, which can worsen cognitive impairment.

Lorazepam (Option B) is a benzodiazepine that can be sedating but carries a risk of respiratory depression and may not be the best choice for an elderly patient with potential for falls and other complications.

Phenobarbital (Option D) is a barbiturate that is not commonly used for delirium management due to its high risk of respiratory depression and sedation.

Physical restraints (Option E) should be a last resort in managing delirium due to the risks of injury and psychological harm.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to administer olanzapine (Option C) to help manage the patient's delirium symptoms.",Success
"A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, weight loss, and muscle aches during the past 2 months. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. Her only medication is a multivitamin. A metyrapone stimulation test is performed and the results rule out a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Which of the following changes in laboratory findings are most likely to have been observed in this patient following the administration of the drug?",A,"The metyrapone stimulation test is used to assess adrenal function by inhibiting the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxylase, which is necessary for the final step in cortisol synthesis. By blocking this enzyme, metyrapone leads to an accumulation of the precursor 11-deoxycortisol and, in healthy individuals, a compensatory increase in the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary gland. This increase in ACTH is a response to the low cortisol levels that result from the inhibition of cortisol synthesis. In adrenal insufficiency, the adrenal glands are unable to produce cortisol in response to ACTH, and thus the cortisol levels would not increase as expected following metyrapone administration.

Given that the patient's metyrapone stimulation test ruled out a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, it is most likely that the test observed an appropriate compensatory increase in ACTH and an increase in the precursor hormone 11-deoxycortisol. However, since the question asks for the change that is most likely to have been observed, the correct answer is:

A. Increase in serum ACTH

This is because the test is designed to provoke an increase in ACTH as a response to the inhibited cortisol synthesis. The increase in 11-deoxycortisol is also expected, but it is not one of the options provided. The other options (B, C, D, and E) do not accurately describe the expected changes following a metyrapone stimulation test in a patient without adrenal insufficiency.",Success
An investigator conducts a study to determine whether earlier detection of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in patients increases survival time. One subset of study participants consists of asymptomatic individuals who were diagnosed with GBM after undergoing a screening MRI of the brain. The other subset of study participants was diagnosed with GBM only after they developed symptoms. Results from the study show that the asymptomatic patients who were diagnosed with screening MRI had an average survival time that was 6 weeks longer than that of the patients who were diagnosed after symptom onset. Which of the following statistical biases is most likely to have occurred as a result of the endpoint selected for this study?,E,"The statistical bias that is most likely to have occurred as a result of the endpoint selected for this study is E. Lead-time bias. Lead-time bias occurs when the survival time appears to be longer for a group of patients because the diagnosis was made earlier, even though the earlier diagnosis may not have any effect on the actual course of the disease. In this case, the asymptomatic patients who were diagnosed with GBM via screening MRI had an apparent increase in survival time, but this may simply be due to the fact that their disease was detected earlier, not because the earlier detection actually extended their life.",Success
"A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 25 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which he was the restrained driver.

His pulse is 93/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 91/65 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. He is able to move his extremities in response to commands. He opens his eyes spontaneously. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Examination shows multiple bruises over the trunk and extremities. There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) wound at the left fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. There is jugular venous distention. Decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance on percussion are noted on the left. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The most appropriate next step in management for this patient, given the clinical presentation and examination findings, is D. Needle decompression. The patient's symptoms of severe chest pain, mild dyspnea, and oxygen desaturation, along with the physical examination findings of decreased breath sounds, hyperresonance on percussion, and jugular venous distention on the left side, are highly suggestive of a tension pneumothorax. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention to relieve the pressure in the chest cavity.

A tension pneumothorax occurs when air accumulates in the pleural space and creates positive pressure, pushing the mediastinum to the opposite side and compromising venous return to the heart. This can lead to cardiovascular collapse if not treated promptly. Needle decompression is the initial treatment of choice in suspected cases of tension pneumothorax as it can rapidly relieve the pressure and improve the patient's condition while more definitive treatment, such as chest tube insertion, is arranged.

The other options listed are not as immediately necessary or appropriate in this situation:
A. CT scan of the chest would provide detailed imaging but would not address the immediate threat to the patient's life.
B. Bronchoscopy is used to inspect the airways and is not indicated for the management of a tension pneumothorax.
C. Emergency thoracotomy is a major surgical procedure and is not the first-line treatment for a tension pneumothorax.
E. X-ray of the chest would help confirm the diagnosis but does not provide immediate treatment. In cases of suspected tension pneumothorax, needle decompression should be performed before imaging if the diagnosis is highly suspected based on clinical presentation.",Success
"A novel type of PET radiotracer is being developed to evaluate patients with Parkinson’s disease. A clinical research study has enrolled 1,200 patients, half of whom have the disease. The scan is found to be positive in 590 of the 600 patients with known PD, and positive in 20 of the 600 patients without PD. What is the test’s overall specificity?",E,"The specificity of a test is defined as the proportion of true negatives (patients who do not have the disease and are correctly identified as not having the disease by the test) out of all the patients who actually do not have the disease.

In this case, we have:
- 600 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD)
- 600 patients without Parkinson's disease

Out of the 600 patients with PD:

Out of the 600 patients without PD:
- 20 are incorrectly identified as positive by the test (false positives)
- The rest, 580, are correctly identified as negative by the test (true negatives)

To calculate the specificity, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Specificity} = \frac{\text{Number of True Negatives}}{\text{Number of True Negatives} + \text{Number of False Positives}} \]

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is D. Osteoarthritis. The patient's history of bilateral wrist and knee pain, particularly in the context of a history as a professional athlete, suggests a degenerative joint disease. The presence of non-tender nodules on the distal interphalangeal joints (Heberden's nodes) and tenderness at the base of both thumbs (which could indicate basal joint arthritis) are also indicative of osteoarthritis. The patient's age and the absence of systemic symptoms and joint swelling further support this diagnosis over conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or gout. The morning stiffness lasting approximately 50 minutes is also consistent with osteoarthritis, as stiffness in this condition typically lasts less than an hour.",Success
"A 40-year-old businessman who was previously well is brought into the emergency department by his assistant with a complaint of left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation. He has never felt like this before. Past medical history is insignificant. His blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, pulse 86/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F). A T2-weighted MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. The patient is treated with cervical immobilization, a course of steroids, and physical therapy. What other finding will most likely be seen in this patient?",D,"The patient's symptoms and the MRI findings suggest that he has suffered an acute spinal cord injury at the level of C5, likely due to a vertebral artery dissection caused by the chiropractic neck manipulation. The left-sided weakness he is experiencing indicates that the injury has affected the right side of his body, as the spinal cord carries motor and sensory information across to the opposite side of the body.

Given the location of the lesion and the patient's symptoms, the most likely additional finding would be:

E. Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception

This is because the spinothalamic tract, which carries sensory information such as vibration and proprioception, crosses over at the level of the spinal cord before ascending to the brain. Therefore, a lesion at the C5 level on the left side would interrupt the right side's sensory pathways, leading to a loss of vibration and proprioception on the right side of the body.",Success

"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of dysuria and increased urinary frequency. Vital signs are within normal limits. Urinalysis shows cloudy, red urine. This patient's clinical presentation is best explained by an infection with a virus with which of the following features?",E,"The clinical presentation of the 6-year-old boy with dysuria and increased urinary frequency, along with cloudy, red urine, is suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs are typically caused by bacteria, not viruses. However, since the question asks which of the given viral features best explains the clinical presentation, we can infer that the question is aiming to identify a virus that could potentially affect the urinary tract, even though such viruses are less common.

Among the options provided, the one that could potentially cause symptoms related to the urinary tract is:

A. Non-enveloped with linear, single-stranded DNA

This description fits the profile of adenoviruses, which are known to cause infections in the urinary tract, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Adenoviruses can cause a range of illnesses, including respiratory infections, conjunctivitis, and gastroenteritis. However, certain strains of adenovirus (e.g., serotypes 11 and 21) have been associated with hemorrhagic cystitis (inflammation of the bladder that can cause blood in the urine), which could explain the patient's symptoms.

It's important to note that while adenoviruses can cause urinary tract symptoms, bacterial infections are much more common causes of UTIs in children. The symptoms described in the question are more indicative of a bacterial infection, such as Escherichia coli, which is the most common cause of UTIs in children.

Glandular tissue enlargement, which is commonly referred to as gynecomastia. Gynecomastia is the development of breast tissue in males and can occur due to hormonal changes, medication side effects, or underlying medical conditions. In this case, the patient's history of cryptorchidism (which can be associated with hormonal imbalances) and recent initiation of methylphenidate (which, although not commonly associated with gynecomastia, could potentially have an effect) are relevant. However, the description of a discrete, tender mass under the nipple is most consistent with a benign enlargement of glandular breast tissue, which is typical of gynecomastia.

The patient’s history of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the absence of clear provoking factors, such as recent surgery, trauma, or prolonged immobility, suggests an underlying thrombophilia. Protein C deficiency is a hereditary condition that predisposes individuals to thrombosis, particularly in the veins of the legs. Protein C is a natural anticoagulant that helps to inactivate factors Va and VIIIa, thereby regulating the coagulation cascade.

D. Seek a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy

This decision is based on the fact that the child is diagnosed with intermediate-risk neuroblastoma, a serious condition that requires prompt treatment to improve the chances of a cure. The parents' refusal of chemotherapy, despite understanding the risks and benefits, places the child at significant risk of harm or death. In cases where a child's health is endangered by parental decisions, healthcare providers have a duty to act in the best interest of the child, which may involve seeking legal intervention to override parental refusal.

"A laboratory primarily involved with studying cellular proofreading mechanisms is investigating the question of whether the ribosome can recognize a mischarged amino acid and still be incorporated into the growing peptide. In order to do so, they biochemically charge a Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine and insert the tRNA into the cell. They design an mRNA sequence that contains only codons for lysine. Which of the following will most likely occur?",C,"The most likely outcome in this scenario is that the mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated into the growing peptide at the codons that specify for lysine. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C. The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specificy for lysine

This is because the ribosome does not have the ability to proofread the amino acid attached to the tRNA as it enters the ribosome. The accuracy of the amino acid is largely determined by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that charges the tRNA in the first place. However, in this experimental setup, the tRNA has been mischarged with valine instead of lysine. When the ribosome encounters the codon for lysine, it will bind the mischarged tRNA based on the anticodon of the tRNA matching the codon, and the valine will be incorporated into the growing peptide chain. 

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:
A. The ribosome does not have the ability to remove amino acids from tRNAs.
B. The ribosome will not necessarily terminate protein translation due to a single misincorporated amino acid.
D. The proteasome is responsible for degrading proteins, not tRNAs.

On examination of the shoulder joint, severe tenderness was present localized to the greater tuberosity of the left shoulder joint along with biceps tendon tenderness over the bicipital groove. The range of motion was limited to the left side. An X-ray of the joint showed narrowing of the acromiohumeral space with sclerosis and spurring of the acromion. Routine blood test results are normal except for the rheumatoid factor, which is positive. What is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The most likely diagnosis for this patient is C. Rheumatoid arthritis. The patient's symptoms, including persistent shoulder pain that worsens with certain movements and positions, along with the physical examination findings of tenderness localized to the greater tuberosity and biceps tendon, suggest an inflammatory process affecting the shoulder joint. The positive rheumatoid factor in the blood test further supports the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of the joints. The X-ray findings of narrowing acromiohumeral space with sclerosis and spurring of the acromion are also consistent with rheumatoid arthritis, although these changes can also be seen in other conditions such as osteoarthritis.

Examination of the stillborn shows a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet. An x-ray shows the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition?",D,"The condition described in the question is consistent with sacral agenesis, which is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the absence of part or all of the sacrum and often associated with other anomalies such as spinal, pelvic, and limb malformations. Among the options given, chromosome abnormalities are known to be associated with such complex congenital anomalies.

Option C, Chromosome 13 trisomy (Patau syndrome), and Option E, Chromosome 18 trisomy (Edwards syndrome), are both associated with a wide range of severe congenital anomalies, including sacral agenesis. However, between the two, Chromosome 18 trisomy (Edwards syndrome) is more commonly associated with sacral anomalies, including sacral agenesis, than Chromosome 13 trisomy.

Therefore, the strongest predisposing factor for the condition described in the question is:

E. Chromosome 18 trisomy

It is important to note that other factors listed, such as maternal oligohydramnios, intrauterine alcohol exposure, and maternal diabetes, can also contribute to congenital anomalies, but they are not typically associated with the specific constellation of anomalies described in the question.",Success

The authors of the study have decided to conduct a follow-up analysis on their data. They decide to stratify their results by CD4+T-lymphocyte count at the time of diagnosis. Among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, cART adherence was a significant predictor of DLBCL risk (RR = 0.52, p = 0.01). However, among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3, no relationship was found between DLBCL risk and cART adherence (RR = 0.96, p = 0.36). Which of the following explains for the difference observed between the two strata?""",E,"The difference observed between the two strata (patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3 and above 200/mm3) in relation to the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk can be explained by:

E. Effect modification

Effect modification occurs when the effect of an exposure (in this case, cART adherence) on an outcome (DLBCL risk) varies at different levels of a third variable (CD4+ cell count). The fact that cART adherence is a significant predictor of DLBCL risk in patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3 but not in those with counts above 200/mm3 suggests that the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk is modified by the level of CD4+ cell count.",Success

"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician because of abdominal pain and constipation for 3 weeks. His mother says he has been increasingly irritable recently. His vocabulary consists of 50 words and he does not use sentences. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae and abdominal tenderness. He refers to himself by name but is unable to name body parts or count to three. Peripheral blood smear shows small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling. Which of the following processes is most likely impaired in this patient?",C,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are most consistent with iron deficiency anemia. The small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling on the peripheral blood smear are characteristic of iron deficiency anemia. Iron is essential for the synthesis of heme, which is a component of hemoglobin. The conversion of ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+) is necessary for the incorporation of iron into heme. Therefore, the most likely impaired process in this patient is the conversion of ferrous iron to ferric iron (Option A). The other options are not related to the clinical presentation of the patient. For example, the conversion of porphobilinogen to hydroxymethylbilane (Option B) and the conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen (Option C) are steps in the heme synthesis pathway, but they are not typically impaired in iron deficiency anemia. The conversion of homocysteine to methionine (Option D) is a step in the methionine cycle, which is not related to iron deficiency anemia. The conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III (Option E) is another step in the heme synthesis pathway, but it is not typically impaired in iron deficiency anemia.

"A group of researchers conducted a study to determine whether there is an association between folic acid supplementation before pregnancy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. The researchers retrospectively surveyed 200 mothers with children diagnosed with ASD during the first 4 years of life and 200 mothers with healthy children. All participants were interviewed about their prenatal consumption of folic acid using standardized questionnaires. A 94% response rate was obtained from the surveys. The study ultimately found that folic acid supplementation was associated with lower rates of ASD in offspring (OR = 0.3, p < 0.01). Which of the following type of bias is most likely to have influenced these results?",C,"The type of bias that is most likely to have influenced the results of the study is C. Recall bias. Recall bias occurs when there are differences in the accuracy or completeness of the memories recalled by study participants. In this case, mothers of children with ASD may be more likely to accurately recall and report their prenatal folic acid supplementation because they may have been more concerned about potential causes of their child's condition. This could lead to an overestimation of the association between folic acid supplementation and lower rates of ASD if mothers of healthy children are less likely to accurately remember their prenatal supplement use.",Success
"A student studying pharmacology is a member of a team that is conducting research related to the elimination of multiple anticoagulant medications. His duty as a member of the team is to collect serum samples of the subjects every 4 hours and send them for analysis of serum drug levels. He is also supposed to collect, document and analyze the data. For one of the subjects, he notices that the subject is eliminating 0.5 mg of the drug every 4 hours. Which of the following anticoagulants did this patient most likely consume?",A,"The information provided does not specify the half-life or the elimination rate of the anticoagulants in question, which are critical factors in determining which drug the subject is likely taking. However, we can make an educated guess based on the elimination characteristics of each drug and the context given.

A. Warfarin: This anticoagulant is eliminated primarily through hepatic metabolism, with a half-life of about 36-42 hours. It is unlikely that a patient would eliminate a consistent amount of Warfarin every 4 hours, as its elimination is not that rapid.

B. Enoxaparin: This is a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) that is eliminated primarily through renal excretion. Its half-life is about 4-5 hours, which is relatively short compared to other anticoagulants. Enoxaparin is eliminated in a relatively consistent manner over time, making it a possible candidate.

C. Dabigatran: This is a direct thrombin inhibitor with a half-life of about 12-14 hours. It is primarily eliminated through renal excretion. The elimination rate of Dabigatran does not fit the 4-hour elimination pattern described.

D. Fondaparinux: This is a synthetic pentasaccharide that acts as an anticoagulant by activating antithrombin. It has a half-life of about 17 hours and is eliminated primarily through renal excretion. Like Dabigatran, the elimination rate does not fit the 4-hour pattern described.

E. Apixaban: This is a direct factor Xa inhibitor with a half-life of about 12 hours. It is eliminated primarily through hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. The elimination rate does not fit the 4-hour pattern described.

Given the information, the most likely anticoagulant that the subject is taking, based on the pattern of elimination, is Enoxaparin (Option B). This is because Enoxaparin has a relatively short half-life and is eliminated consistently over time, which could potentially result in a consistent amount of the drug being eliminated every 4 hours. However, without additional information about the dosage and the specific elimination kinetics for each drug in the context of the study, this is an inference rather than a definitive answer.",Success
"A 40-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a checkup. She has felt weaker lately and has lost some weight. She denies any urinary issues. Her BUN at her last visit 4 months ago was 45 mg/dL, and her creatinine was 2.0 mg/dL. Her laboratory studies this visit are seen below:

The patient's symptoms of weakness and weight loss, along with her laboratory results showing anemia (low hemoglobin and hematocrit), hyperkalemia (high potassium), metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate), and elevated BUN and creatinine levels, are all indicative of chronic kidney disease. The fact that her BUN and creatinine levels have increased since her last visit also supports this diagnosis. Acute kidney failure would typically present with a sudden increase in BUN and creatinine, while obstructive uropathy and ascending pyelonephritis would likely present with urinary symptoms, which the patient denies. Renal cell carcinoma can present with anemia and weight loss, but the laboratory results are more indicative of chronic kidney disease.",Success
"A 28-year-old woman comes to the obstetrics and gynecology clinic because she has been unsuccessfully trying to conceive with her husband for the last 2 years. He has had 2 children from a previous marriage and has been tested for causes of male infertility. She has had prior abdominal surgery as well as a family history of endocrine abnormalities. Based on this history, a panel of tests are obtained and treatment is started. This treatment will be administered intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle. If the most likely drug prescribed in this case was administered in a different manner, which of the following conditions may also be treated by this drug?",E,"The most likely drug prescribed in this case, given the history of prior abdominal surgery, family history of endocrine abnormalities, and the timing of administration (one week before her normal menstrual cycle), is likely a medication that affects the menstrual cycle or fertility. The treatment timing suggests that it is related to ovulation induction or management of the menstrual cycle.

The drug that fits this description and can be administered intermittently as described is likely a form of progesterone or a medication that affects progesterone levels. Progesterone is often used to support the endometrial lining and prevent spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) in early pregnancy, and it can also be used to regulate the menstrual cycle in women with irregular periods or to treat luteal phase defects.

If this drug were administered in a different manner, it could also be used to treat Premature Labor (Option D). Progesterone is used as a weekly injection starting in the second trimester to prevent preterm birth in women with a history of preterm delivery or a short cervix.

Options A (Diabetes), B (Parkinson's disease), C (Polycystic ovarian syndrome), and E (Prostate cancer) are not typically treated with progesterone or similar drugs that would fit the description given in the question. However, it's worth noting that for Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), progesterone can be used to regulate menstrual cycles, but it is not a primary treatment for the condition itself. For prostate cancer, anti-androgens or drugs that lower testosterone levels are used, not progesterone.

Initial laboratory tests show an elevated serum creatinine (Cr) of 1.9 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 29 mg/dL. Which of the following findings would be expected in this patient’s urine?",B,"The patient's history of consuming antifreeze, along with his laboratory results, suggests a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. Ethylene glycol is a common ingredient in antifreeze and is highly toxic. It is metabolized in the body to oxalic acid, which can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine. These crystals can cause renal damage and may lead to acute kidney injury, as indicated by the elevated serum creatinine and BUN levels.

Therefore, the expected finding in this patient's urine would be:

Examination shows oily skin with numerous comedones, pustules, and scarring over the face and upper back. Long-term therapy is started with combined oral contraceptive pills. This medication decreases the patient's risk developing of which of the following conditions?",B,"The correct answer is B. Ovarian cancer.

Combined oral contraceptive pills (COCs) have been shown to decrease the risk of developing ovarian cancer. This protective effect is thought to be due to the suppression of ovulation and the reduction in the number of lifetime ovulatory cycles. The risk of ovarian cancer decreases with longer use of COCs and the protective effect persists even after discontinuation of the pills.

It is important to note that COCs do not decrease the risk of developing hypertension, malignant melanoma, cervical cancer, or breast cancer. In fact, COCs may slightly increase the risk of developing some of these conditions, although the overall risk remains low for most women.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

C. Cervical lymph nodes

Thyroid cancers, particularly papillary and follicular types, have a propensity to metastasize to the cervical lymph nodes. The presence of a hypoechoic nodule on ultrasound and a cytological report suggesting neoplasia further supports the suspicion of malignancy. The planned treatment with near-total thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine therapy is a common approach for thyroid cancers, especially those with a high risk of metastasis. The CT scan is likely being performed to assess for any distant metastases, as the lungs and bones are common sites for thyroid cancer spread beyond the cervical lymph nodes.",Success

A 10-year-old Caucasian female with Turner's syndrome underwent an abdominal imaging study and was discovered that the poles of her kidneys were fused inferiorly. Normal ascension of kidney during embryological development would be prevented by which of the following anatomical structures?,C,"The correct answer is C. Inferior mesenteric artery.

Explanation: The inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) can occasionally interfere with the normal ascension of the kidneys during embryological development, leading to anomalies such as fusion of the poles of the kidneys. The IMA arises from the anterior surface of the aorta at the level of the third lumbar vertebra and supplies the descending colon, sigmoid colon, and the upper part of the rectum. In some cases, the IMA can cross the path of the ascending kidneys, leading to their entrapment and subsequent fusion, a condition known as ""crossed fused ectopia"" or ""horseshoe kidney.""

Turner's syndrome is not directly related to the development of horseshoe kidney, but it is worth noting that individuals with Turner's syndrome may have an increased prevalence of renal anomalies.",Success

Endometrial cells obtained from study participants are plated on growth media and the distribution of cell cycle phase is measured with flow cytometry. Drug X, which is known to activate cyclin-dependent kinase 4, is administered to all the cells, and the distribution of cell cycle phase is measured again 1 hour later. Which of the following is most likely to result from the action of drug X on the Rb gene?",C,"The retinoblastoma (Rb) protein is a tumor suppressor that plays a critical role in controlling cell cycle progression. It is particularly involved in preventing cells from entering S phase (the phase of the cell cycle during which DNA replication occurs) until certain conditions are met. The Rb protein is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), particularly CDK4 and CDK6, which are activated by cyclin D. When CDK4 and CDK6 are active, they phosphorylate Rb, causing it to release its inhibitory effect on E2F transcription factors. This allows E2F to activate genes required for S phase entry.

Given that drug X is known to activate cyclin-dependent kinase 4, its administration would result in the phosphorylation of Rb. This phosphorylation would release the inhibition on E2F, allowing the cell to proceed from G1 phase to S phase. Therefore, the most likely result from the action of drug X on the Rb gene is the initiation of S phase.

Necrotizing inflammation of the renal glomeruli. The patient's history of chronic tension headaches and daily aspirin use, along with her symptoms of bilateral flank pain and reddish urine, suggest a possible renal pathology. The laboratory findings of an elevated serum creatinine concentration and microscopic hematuria (RBC > 16/hpf) without casts or dysmorphic RBCs are consistent with glomerular disease. The lack of significant proteinuria (as indicated by the 3+ protein in the urine) and white blood cells (WBC 2/hpf) also points away from a bacterial infection or tubular injury.

"A 37-year-old primigravid woman at 12 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and dull suprapubic pain for 3 hours. She has had spotting during the last 3 days. Her medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 89/65 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a dilated cervical os and a uterus consistent in size with an 11-week gestation. Ultrasonography shows an embryo of 4 cm in crown-rump length and no fetal cardiac activity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The most appropriate next step in management for this patient is likely D. Dilation and curettage (D&C). The patient's symptoms, examination findings, and ultrasound results are indicative of a missed abortion (also known as a missed miscarriage), which is a pregnancy where the embryo or fetus has died but has not been expelled from the uterus. The lack of fetal cardiac activity and the dilated cervical os are key findings that support this diagnosis.

In a missed abortion, the body may not spontaneously expel the pregnancy tissue, which can lead to complications such as infection or excessive bleeding. Dilation and curettage is a surgical procedure in which the cervix is dilated and the uterine lining is scraped to remove any remaining pregnancy tissue. This is often the preferred method of treatment in cases of missed abortion to prevent complications and to provide tissue for histopathological examination, which can help in determining the cause of the miscarriage.

While misoprostol therapy (option A) can be used to induce uterine contractions and expulsion of the pregnancy tissue, it is typically used in cases where the patient prefers a medical management approach or when surgical options are not readily available. Methotrexate therapy (option C) is used for treating ectopic pregnancies and is not indicated in this scenario. Follow-up ultrasonography (option B) might be appropriate if the diagnosis was uncertain or if the patient was hemodynamically stable and opted for expectant management, but in this case, the diagnosis is clear, and the patient is symptomatic. Complete bed rest (option E) is not an effective treatment for a missed abortion and does not address the need for removal of the nonviable pregnancy tissue.",Success

Dysfunction in the motility of respiratory cilia. This condition is known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), which can lead to recurrent respiratory infections, including pneumonia, due to impaired clearance of mucus and pathogens from the airways. The presence of a nasal polyp, chronic cough, and recurrent pneumonia are all consistent with PCD. The loose, foul-smelling stools may also suggest malabsorption, which can be associated with PCD due to involvement of the cilia in the fallopian tubes and the efferent ducts of the male reproductive tract, although it is less common.

Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this infant?",A,"The most appropriate next step in the management of this infant, given that the mother has HIV and received antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, is to perform HIV DNA testing (Option C). HIV DNA testing is a sensitive method to detect HIV infection in infants and is recommended for infants born to HIV-positive mothers, regardless of maternal antiretroviral therapy. This test can detect HIV infection in infants as early as 1-2 weeks after birth, and it is crucial for early diagnosis and initiation of treatment if necessary. Administering zidovudine (Option A) might also be considered as part of the infant's prophylactic treatment regimen, but this should be guided by the results of the HIV DNA test and the specific guidelines for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. HIV antibody testing (Option B) is not recommended in this scenario because infants born to HIV-positive mothers will have maternal antibodies that can give a false positive result until about 18 months of age. HIV RNA testing (Option D) can also be used for diagnosis, but HIV DNA testing is generally preferred in this context due to its higher sensitivity in detecting low-level viremia in infants. Reassurance and follow-up (Option E) are important but should not be the only actions taken given the potential for mother-to-child transmission of HIV.",Success

Treating the underlying illness. The patient's persistent hypotension, despite appropriate antibiotics for the E. coli infection, suggests that there may be other factors contributing to her condition that need to be addressed. The costovertebral tenderness suggests possible renal involvement, which could be contributing to her hypotension. The laboratory results show a slight decrease in creatinine, which is a positive sign, but her free T3 level is low, which could indicate thyroid dysfunction contributing to her hypotension. However, the TSH level is within normal range, indicating that the thyroid dysfunction may be secondary to her critical illness rather than a primary thyroid disorder.

The abdominal ultrasonography results, although not described in detail, are likely to show findings consistent with a liver abscess, given the context of the question.

The presence of diabetes mellitus as a comorbidity increases the risk of developing a liver abscess, especially if the patient has poor glycemic control. The fact that the stool test for Entamoeba histolytica antigen is negative rules out amoebic liver abscess, which is a common cause of liver abscess in endemic areas.

Given the clinical presentation and the likely diagnosis of a pyogenic liver abscess, the best initial step in management would be to start broad-spectrum antibiotics and consider percutaneous drainage. Metronidazole, which is effective against anaerobic bacteria, is often used in combination with other antibiotics that cover aerobic bacteria, such as a third-generation cephalosporin or a fluoroquinolone. This approach is in line with option D, which suggests antibiotics and drainage.

Options A, B, C, and E are not the best initial steps in this scenario:

A lymph node biopsy shows granuloma formation and large CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's laboratory findings?",D,"The most likely explanation for this patient's laboratory findings is E. Production of PTH-related peptide by malignant cells.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of hypercalcemia, which is often associated with malignancy. The presence of a progressively growing mass in the axilla, along with weight loss and fever, suggests a neoplastic process. The lymph node biopsy revealing granuloma formation and large CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei is characteristic of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Hypercalcemia in malignancy is often due to the production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) by the tumor cells. PTHrP has a similar amino acid sequence to PTH and can bind to the same receptors on bone and kidney cells, leading to increased bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption, resulting in hypercalcemia. The patient's low PTH concentration rules out increased release of PTH by parathyroid chief cells (Option B).

Option A (excessive intake of dietary ergocalciferol) is unlikely given the patient's only medication is a multivitamin, and dietary intake alone is usually insufficient to cause hypercalcemia. Option C (induction of focal osteolysis by tumor cells) could contribute to hypercalcemia but does not explain the low PTH levels. Option D (secretion of γ-interferon by activated T-lymphocytes) is not typically associated with hypercalcemia.",Success

Which of the following best explains this patient's laboratory findings?""",B,"The patient's laboratory findings are most consistent with option D: Previous hepatitis A infection. However, there is a critical error in interpreting the results as provided. Let's break down the results:

1. Anti-HAV IgM Positive: This indicates a recent or acute hepatitis A infection.
2. Anti-HAV IgG Negative: This is contradictory to an acute infection since Anti-HAV IgG usually appears during the convalescent phase and persists for life, indicating past infection. However, in the early stages of acute infection, Anti-HAV IgG may not yet be detectable. Therefore, this result might be due to the timing of the test in relation to the infection.
3. HBsAg Negative: This indicates the absence of an active hepatitis B infection.
4. Anti-HBs Positive: This indicates immunity to hepatitis B, which could be due to previous vaccination or a past infection.
5. HBcAg Negative: This is consistent with the absence of an active hepatitis B infection.
6. Anti-HBc Negative: This indicates no past or current hepatitis B infection.
7. HBeAg Negative: This is consistent with the absence of an active hepatitis B infection.
8. Anti-HBe Negative: This is also consistent with the absence of an active hepatitis B infection.
9. Anti-HCV Negative: This indicates no current or past hepatitis C infection.

Given the positive Anti-HAV IgM and the negative Anti-HAV IgG, the most likely explanation is that the patient has a recent or acute hepatitis A infection. The negative Anti-HAV IgG could be due to the early stage of infection, before the antibodies have fully developed. The positive Anti-HBs indicates immunity to hepatitis B, but the other negative hepatitis B markers rule out an active or chronic hepatitis B infection. The negative Anti-HCV rules out hepatitis C.

Therefore, the correct interpretation would be closest to option B: Active hepatitis A infection, considering the timing of the Anti-HAV IgG result. However, since the question does not provide an option for an ""active hepatitis A infection,"" and given the error in the Anti-HAV IgG result, the closest correct answer based on the provided options would be C: Previous hepatitis A infection, acknowledging that the Anti-HAV IgG result is likely to become positive as the infection progresses.",Success

Xeroderma pigmentosum is caused by defects in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, which is responsible for repairing DNA damage caused by UV light. Therefore, the process likely impaired in this patient is nucleotide excision repair (Option A).",Success
"A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a neck mass. He first noticed a firm mass on the anterior aspect of his neck approximately 4 months ago.

"A group of researchers decided to explore whether the estimates of incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were influenced by the number of years it took to examine administrative data. These estimates were not only based on hospital discharges, but also on physician billing codes. For study purposes, the researchers labeled incident cases at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases were those that were coded as harboring SLE at any time, with patients maintaining their diagnosis until death. Which statement is true regarding the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study?",B,"The correct answer is B. Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.

Explanation: Incidence rates are calculated as the number of new cases of a disease in a specified time period per population at risk. In shorter time periods, the denominator (population at risk) is likely to be smaller, which can result in a higher incidence rate. Conversely, in longer time periods, the denominator (population at risk) is larger, which can result in a lower incidence rate. This is because the incidence rate is a measure of the rate at which new cases occur in a population over time, and a longer time period allows for more time for new cases to develop, which can dilute the rate.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:
A. Examining successively longer time periods will not necessarily result in substantially lower prevalence estimates. Prevalence is the proportion of a population found to have a condition at a specific time, and it can increase over time as new cases accumulate and existing cases persist.
C. The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will not necessarily be overestimated. Prevalence can be accurately estimated in shorter time windows if the data are complete and the case definition is consistent.
D. The inclusion of attack rates would not increase incidence estimates in longer time periods. Attack rates are a measure of the proportion of a population that becomes ill during a specific time period, and they are not directly related to incidence rates.
E. The inclusion of attack rates would not decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods. Attack rates are not directly related to incidence rates, and they would not affect the calculation of incidence rates in shorter time periods.",Success
"A 48-year-old Caucasian female presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of progressive weakness and shortness of breath. She has had progressive shortness of breath over the last year with an intermittent non-productive cough. In addition, she complains of difficulty raising her arms to brush her hair. Her temperature is 99.6°F (37.6°C), pulse is 80/min, blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Neurologic exam shows 4/5 strength in the deltoid muscles bilaterally. Diffuse dry crackles are heard on lung auscultation. A faint erythematous rash is noted on the malar cheeks, periorbital areas, lateral proximal thighs, and the elbows. Which of the following tests is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",A,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is dermatomyositis, given the patient's symptoms of progressive weakness, shortness of breath, and the presence of a characteristic rash on the malar cheeks, periorbital areas, lateral proximal thighs, and elbows. Dermatomyositis is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the muscles and skin. The rash, known as a heliotrope rash, is a hallmark of dermatomyositis. The patient's respiratory symptoms and lung findings on examination (diffuse dry crackles) suggest possible interstitial lung disease, which is a common complication of dermatomyositis.

To confirm the diagnosis of dermatomyositis, a combination of tests may be required. However, the most specific test to confirm dermatomyositis is:

A. Muscle biopsy

A muscle biopsy can show characteristic histopathological features of dermatomyositis, such as perifascicular atrophy and inflammation. This is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis.

Other tests that may be useful in supporting the diagnosis or assessing the extent of the disease include:

D. Serum ANA titer

A positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer is common in patients with dermatomyositis, although it is not specific to this condition. Elevated levels of muscle enzymes such as creatine kinase (CK) may also be present.

C. Pulmonary function tests

Pulmonary function tests can help assess the extent of lung involvement in patients with dermatomyositis, which can guide treatment and management.

B. CT scan

A CT scan of the chest may be used to evaluate lung involvement and can help identify interstitial lung disease, which is common in dermatomyositis.

E. Skin biopsy

A skin biopsy can also be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of dermatomyositis, as it can show characteristic changes such as perivascular and interstitial inflammation, atrophy of the epidermis, and degeneration of the basal layer.

In summary, while all of the listed tests can be useful in the evaluation of this patient, the most specific test to confirm the diagnosis of dermatomyositis is a muscle biopsy (option A).",Success

"A 41-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with abdominal pain. He says that the pain “comes and goes” throughout the day and usually lasts 20-30 minutes per episode. He can point to the spot 1-2 inches above the umbilicus where he feels the pain. He denies any feeling of regurgitation or nighttime cough but endorses nausea. He reports that he used to eat three large meals per day but has found that eating more frequently improves his pain. He tried a couple pills of ibuprofen with food over the past couple days and thinks it helped. He has gained four pounds since his past appointment three months ago. The patient denies any diarrhea or change in his stools. He has no past medical history. He drinks 5-6 beers on the weekend and has a 20 pack-year smoking history. He denies any family history of cancer. On physical exam, he is tender to palpation above the umbilicus. Bowel sounds are present. A stool guaiac test is positive. The patient undergoes endoscopy with biopsy to diagnose his condition.

Which of the following is most likely to be found on histology?",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and the positive stool guaiac test, which indicates the presence of blood in the stool, the most likely diagnosis is a peptic ulcer disease, possibly caused by Helicobacter pylori infection. The presence of tenderness above the umbilicus, improvement of pain with more frequent eating, and the history of smoking and alcohol use are all consistent with this diagnosis.

The most likely finding on histology would be:

A. Mucosal defect in the stomach

This is because peptic ulcers can cause mucosal defects in the stomach or duodenum. The patient's symptoms and the positive stool guaiac test are consistent with bleeding from an ulcer. Additionally, the fact that the patient found that eating more frequently improved his pain is also indicative of peptic ulcer disease, as food can help buffer stomach acid and reduce ulcer pain.

While H. pylori infection (option B) is often associated with peptic ulcer disease, the question asks for the most likely finding on histology, which would be the mucosal defect itself (option A). H. pylori may be present, but the question does not specifically ask for the cause of the ulcer, only the histological finding.",Success

She has Tanner stage I breast development and pubic hair.

This patient is most likely to have which of the following additional findings?",A,"The patient's clinical presentation does not provide clear evidence for any of the additional findings listed in the options. However, given her history of moderate persistent asthma, recent diagnosis of myopia, and the physical exam findings of a low hairline and a broad chest, which can be associated with certain genetic conditions, option B (elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level) might be considered if there is a suspicion of a bone-related disorder that could be associated with these features. Elevated alkaline phosphatase can be seen in conditions such as hypophosphatasia or rickets, which can affect bone development and potentially lead to skeletal abnormalities.

However, none of the options provided are strongly indicated by the information given. The patient's weight and height percentiles being consistent with her growth curve suggest that she is growing normally, and her Tanner stage I breast development and pubic hair are also consistent with her age.

C. Initiate a different statin

The patient's symptoms are consistent with statin-induced myopathy, a known side effect of statin use. Since the symptoms resolved upon discontinuation of rosuvastatin, it is reasonable to try a different statin at a potentially lower dose, as different statins have varying potencies and side effect profiles.

Activation of which of the following best explains the pathogenesis of this condition?",C,"The correct answer is D. Phosphoprotein p53.

Explanation: Carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix is often associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The E6 and E7 proteins of high-risk HPV types inactivate the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), respectively. This inactivation leads to loss of cell cycle control, genomic instability, and ultimately to the development of cervical cancer. The p53 protein plays a critical role in preventing the development of cancer by regulating the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis in damaged cells. When p53 is inactivated, cells with damaged DNA can continue to divide uncontrollably, leading to the development of cancer.",Success
"A research group has developed a low-cost diagnostic retinal imaging device for cytomegalovirus retinitis in a population of HIV-infected patients. In a pilot study of 50 patients, the imaging test detected the presence of CMV retinitis in 50% of the patients. An ophthalmologist slit lamp examination, which was performed for each patient to serve as the gold standard for diagnosis, confirmed a diagnosis of CMV retinitis in 20 patients that were found to be positive through imaging, as well as 1 patient who tested negative with the device. If the prevalence of CMV retinitis in the population decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, how will positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the diagnostic test be affected?",B,"Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is the proportion of patients with a positive test result who actually have the disease. Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is the proportion of patients with a negative test result who do not have the disease.

In the given scenario, the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy. This means that there are fewer actual cases of the disease in the population.

The initial PPV can be calculated as follows:
- True Positives (TP) = 20
- False Positives (FP) = (50% of 50 patients tested positive, but only 20 were confirmed by the gold standard) = 25 - 20 = 5
- PPV = TP / (TP + FP) = 20 / (20 + 5) = 20 / 25 = 0.8 or 80%

The initial NPV can be calculated as follows:
- True Negatives (TN) = 50 - 50% (positive) - 1 (false negative) = 50 - 25 - 1 = 24
- False Negatives (FN) = 1
- NPV = TN / (TN + FN) = 24 / (24 + 1) = 24 / 25 = 0.96 or 96%

As the prevalence decreases, the number of true positives will decrease because there are fewer cases of the disease. However, the number of false positives will likely remain relatively unchanged unless the specificity of the test changes, which it does not in this scenario.

This will result in a lower PPV because the ratio of true positives to the total number of positive tests (true positives + false positives) will decrease.

The NPV will increase because with fewer actual cases of the disease, the number of true negatives will increase, and the ratio of true negatives to the total number of negative tests (true negatives + false negatives) will increase.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

B. PPV decreases, NPV increases",Success

Which of the following is the best initial course of treatment for this patient?",A,"The patient's belief in an impending 'invasion of the mole people' and the use of bear traps and a garlic necklace to protect herself from these perceived threats suggests a delusional disorder. Delusional disorders are characterized by non-bizarre delusions, which are beliefs that are not implausible but are false and held with strong conviction despite evidence to the contrary. The patient's lack of past psychiatric history and denial of hearing voices or seeing objects rules out schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders that typically include hallucinations.

Given the patient's presentation, the best initial course of treatment would be:

D. A brief trial of antipsychotic therapy

Antipsychotic medications can be effective in treating delusional disorders by reducing the intensity of delusional thinking. A brief trial would be appropriate to assess the patient's response to medication and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can also be beneficial in conjunction with medication, but it is not the first-line treatment for a delusional disorder.

The primary care provider recommends keeping a sleep journal and provides a questionnaire for the patient’s wife. The patient returns one month later to report no changes to his condition. The sleep journal reveals that the patient is getting sufficient sleep and wakes up rested. The questionnaire reveals that the patient does not snore nor does he stop breathing during his sleep. A sleep study reveals mean sleep latency of 6 minutes. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient’s condition?",A,"Based on the information provided, the patient appears to have excessive daytime sleepiness without evidence of sleep-disordered breathing or poor sleep hygiene. The mean sleep latency of 6 minutes on the sleep study suggests a diagnosis of narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia. Given the patient's symptoms and the results of the sleep study, the best course of treatment would be a medication that can help improve wakefulness.

Option A, Methylphenidate, is a stimulant that can be used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in conditions like narcolepsy. It is a common first-line treatment for such conditions due to its effectiveness in promoting wakefulness.

Option B, Sodium oxybate, is also used in the treatment of narcolepsy, particularly for cataplexy, which the patient does not seem to have based on the information provided.

Option C, Imipramine, is a tricyclic antidepressant that is not typically used for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness.

Option D, Increasing daytime naps, could potentially help the patient feel more rested, but it does not address the underlying cause of the excessive sleepiness.

Option E, Changing career, is not a medical treatment and does not address the patient's medical condition.

Given that the patient does not have cataplexy (as indicated by the absence of mention and the fact that his wife did not report any abnormal behaviors during sleep), the best course of treatment would be to start with a stimulant that can help improve wakefulness without the need for a medication that targets cataplexy.

What is the most appropriate next step in the management of the patient?,A,"The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is A. Surgical debridement.

The patient's presentation of wound dehiscence, presence of dead necrotic tissue, and pus suggests a surgical site infection. The CT findings of a small fluid collection with fat stranding in the perisurgical soft tissues further support this diagnosis. Surgical debridement is necessary to remove the necrotic tissue and any foreign material that may be contributing to the infection, and to provide tissue for culture to guide antibiotic therapy.

"A routine newborn screening test for phenylketonuria in a male neonate shows a serum phenylalanine concentration of 44 mg/dL (N < 20). He is started on a special diet and the hyperphenylalaninemia resolves. At a routine well-child examination 4 months later, the physician notices that he has persistent head lag. On examination, he has blue eyes, pale skin, blonde hair, and generalized hypotonia. His serum prolactin level is markedly elevated. Supplementation of which of the following substances is most likely to prevent further complications of this patient's condition?",D,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is required for the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood and tissues, which can cause severe neurological damage.

The patient's symptoms of persistent head lag, blue eyes, pale skin, blonde hair, and generalized hypotonia, as well as the markedly elevated serum prolactin level, are all consistent with the clinical presentation of PKU. The treatment for PKU involves a low-phenylalanine diet and supplementation with tyrosine, which is the product of the phenylalanine hydroxylation reaction that is deficient in PKU.

Therefore, the substance that is most likely to prevent further complications of this patient's condition is tyrosine (Option A). Tyrosine supplementation can help to maintain adequate levels of this essential amino acid, which is required for the synthesis of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine, and can help to prevent the neurological damage that can occur in untreated PKU. 

The other options (B-E) are not directly related to the treatment of PKU and are therefore less likely to be effective in preventing further complications in this patient.",Success
"A 36-year-old nursing home worker presents to the clinic with the complaints of breathlessness, cough, and night sweats for the past 2 months. She further expresses her concerns about the possibility of contracting tuberculosis as one of the patients under her care is being treated for tuberculosis. A PPD skin test is done and reads 11 mm on day 3. Chest X-ray demonstrates a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe. The standard anti-tuberculosis medication regimen is started. At a follow-up appointment 3 months later the patient presents with fatigue. She has also been experiencing occasional dizziness, weakness, and numbness in her feet. Physical exam is positive for conjunctival pallor. Lab work is significant for a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume of 68 fl. What is the most likely cause of her current symptoms?",E,"The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is B. Inhibition of ferrochelatase. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, weakness, and numbness in her feet, along with her lab results showing a low hemoglobin level and a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV), suggest that she is suffering from anemia. The specific type of anemia indicated by her lab results is microcytic anemia, which is often caused by iron deficiency. One of the medications used in the treatment of tuberculosis, isoniazid, can inhibit the enzyme ferrochelatase, which is involved in the production of heme from iron. This can lead to a decrease in the production of heme and, subsequently, a decrease in the production of hemoglobin, resulting in anemia.",Success
"A 23-year-old woman is referred to a genetic counselor. She is feeling well but is concerned because her brother was recently diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis. All first-degree relatives were encouraged to undergo genetic screening for any mutations associated with the disease. Today, she denies fever, chills, joint pain, or skin hyperpigmentation. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 123/78 mm Hg. Her physical examination is normal. Her serum iron, hemoglobin, ferritin, and AST and ALT concentrations are normal. Gene screening will involve a blood specimen. Which of the following genes would suggest hereditary hemochromatosis?",D,"The gene that would suggest hereditary hemochromatosis is the HFE gene. This gene is responsible for regulating iron absorption in the body, and mutations in this gene can lead to excessive iron absorption and accumulation, which is characteristic of hereditary hemochromatosis. Therefore, the correct answer is D. HFE gene.",Success
"A 16-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with constant abdominal pain over the past 8 hours. The pain is in her right lower quadrant (RLQ), which is also where it began. She has had no nausea or vomiting despite eating a snack 2 hours ago. She had a similar episode last month which resolved on its own. Her menstrual cycles are 28–30 days apart with 3–5 days of vaginal bleeding. Her last menses ended 9 days ago. Her blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 78/min, the respirations are 15/min, and the temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F). Abdominal examination shows moderate pain on direct pressure over the RLQ which decreases with the release of pressure. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 12.5 mg/dL
Leukocyte count 6000/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 55%
Lymphocytes 39%
Platelet count 260,000/mm3
Serum  
C-reactive protein 5 mg/L (N < 8 mg/L)
Urine  
RBC 1-2 phf
WBC None
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"Based on the patient's symptoms and the physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is appendicitis. The pain in the right lower quadrant, the fact that the pain does not resolve with eating, and the absence of other symptoms such as nausea or vomiting are all indicative of appendicitis. The normal vital signs and the laboratory results, including a normal white blood cell count and a slightly elevated C-reactive protein, do not rule out appendicitis but suggest that the inflammation may not be severe.

However, the absence of leukocytosis (an elevated white blood cell count) and the presence of a normal platelet count and hemoglobin level are not typical for a severe acute inflammatory process such as appendicitis. The normal urine analysis also does not suggest a urinary tract infection, which could also present with RLQ pain.

Given the patient's history of a similar episode last month that resolved on its own, it is possible that she may have a recurrent condition that could be appendicitis, or another condition that presents with similar symptoms. The absence of severe signs of inflammation and the lack of other concerning findings on examination could suggest a less urgent situation, but appendicitis must still be ruled out due to the potential for rapid progression and complications such as rupture.

The most appropriate next step in management would be to obtain an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan to further evaluate the right lower quadrant for signs of appendicitis or other pathology. This would help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

However, the options provided do not include imaging. Among the options given, none are directly indicated for appendicitis, but if we must choose from the list:

- A. Methotrexate is used for certain types of cancer and autoimmune diseases, not appendicitis.
- B. Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic used for urinary tract infections, which is not indicated in this case.
- C. Reassurance could be appropriate if the diagnosis is not appendicitis and the condition is self-limiting, but appendicitis must first be ruled out.
- D. Referral for surgery is a possibility if appendicitis is confirmed, but imaging should be performed first to confirm the diagnosis.
- E. Tamsulosin is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia and is not indicated in this case.

Given the options, the most appropriate would be C. Reassurance, but with the understanding that imaging should be performed immediately to rule out appendicitis before providing reassurance. If imaging confirms appendicitis, then referral for surgery (option D) would be the next appropriate step.",Success
"A 30-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a complaint of abdominal pain. The patient states he was at a barbecue around noon. Lunch was arranged as a buffet without refrigeration. Within 2 to 3 hours, he had abdominal pain with 3 episodes of watery diarrhea. On exam, vital signs are T 99.1, HR 103, BP 110/55, RR 14. Abdominal exam is significant for pain to deep palpation without any rebounding or guarding. There is no blood on fecal occult testing (FOBT). What is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?",C,"The most likely cause of this patient's presentation is Staphylococcus aureus (Option C). Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning typically has a short incubation period of 2-6 hours, which matches the patient's timeline of symptom onset after eating at the barbecue. Symptoms usually include sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps, and watery diarrhea is also common. The lack of rebound tenderness and guarding on physical examination suggests that there is no peritonitis, which is consistent with food poisoning rather than a more severe gastrointestinal infection or inflammatory process. The other options listed typically have longer incubation periods or present with different symptoms or complications.",Success
"A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by staff of the group home where he resides because of worsening confusion for the past week. He has a history of major depressive disorder and had an ischemic stroke 4 months ago. Current medications are aspirin and sertraline. He is lethargic and disoriented. His pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 135/88 mm Hg. Physical examination shows moist oral mucosa, normal skin turgor, and no peripheral edema. While in the waiting room, he has a generalized, tonic-clonic seizure. Laboratory studies show a serum sodium of 119 mEq/L and an elevated serum antidiuretic hormone concentration. Which of the following sets of additional laboratory findings is most likely in this patient?
 $$$ Serum osmolality %%% Urine sodium %%% Serum aldosterone $$$",E,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion (SIADH). SIADH is characterized by an inappropriately high level of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to water retention and a dilutional hyponatremia. In SIADH, the kidneys retain water despite normal or low serum osmolality, resulting in a low serum sodium concentration.

In SIADH, the serum osmolality is typically low because of the excess water retention. The urine sodium is often high because the kidneys are still excreting sodium even as they retain water. The serum aldosterone level can be normal or low because the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is suppressed in the setting of volume expansion from water retention.

Therefore, the most likely set of additional laboratory findings in this patient would be:

D. ↓ ↑ ↑

This indicates a low serum osmolality (↓), a high urine sodium (↑), and an elevated serum aldosterone level (↑), although aldosterone is often normal or low in SIADH, so the last ↑ might not be the most typical finding. However, among the given options, D is the closest match to the typical laboratory findings in SIADH.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman presents with severe fear reactions to seeing dogs after moving into a new suburban neighborhood. She states that she has always had an irrational and excessive fear of dogs but has been able to avoid it for most of her life while living in the city. When she sees her neighbors walking their dogs outside, she is terrified and begins to feel short of breath. Recently, she has stopped picking up her children from the bus stop and no longer plays outside with her children in order to avoid seeing any dogs. Which of the following would be the best definitive treatment for this patient?",C,"The best definitive treatment for this patient would be C. Systematic desensitization. This is a type of therapy that is often used to treat phobias, which is what the patient appears to be experiencing. Systematic desensitization involves gradually exposing the patient to the feared object or situation in a controlled way, allowing them to confront and overcome their fear. This is often done in conjunction with relaxation techniques to help the patient manage their anxiety.

Option D, Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), could also be effective for this patient. CBT is a type of therapy that helps patients identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors. It can be used to treat a variety of mental health conditions, including phobias. However, systematic desensitization is a specific type of CBT that is particularly well-suited for treating phobias, so it would likely be the more effective treatment in this case.

Options A, B, and E are not the best definitive treatments for this patient. SSRIs (option A) are a type of antidepressant medication that can be used to treat anxiety disorders, but they are not a definitive treatment for phobias. Short-acting benzodiazepines (option B) are a type of medication that can be used to manage anxiety symptoms in the short term, but they do not address the underlying fear and are not a definitive treatment for phobias. Dialectical behavioral therapy (option E) is a type of therapy that is often used to treat borderline personality disorder and other complex mental health conditions, but it is not typically used to treat phobias.",Success
"A 45-year-old man arrives by ambulance to the emergency room after being involved in a very severe construction accident. The patient was found unconscious with a large metal spike protruding from his abdomen by a coworker who was unable to estimate the amount of time the patient went without medical aid. Upon arrival to the ER, the patient was unconscious and unresponsive. His vital signs are BP: 80/40, HR: 120 bpm, RR: 25 bpm, Temperature: 97.1 degrees, and SPO2: 99%.He is taken to the operating room to remove the foreign body and control the bleeding. Although both objectives were accomplished, the patient had an acute drop in his blood pressure during the surgery at which time ST elevations were noted in multiple leads. This resolved with adequate fluid resuscitation and numerous blood transfusions. The patient remained sedated after surgery and continued to have relatively stable vital signs until his third day in the intensive care unit, when he experiences an oxygen desaturation of 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute. On auscultation air entry is present bilaterally with the presence of crackles. A 2/6 systolic murmur is heard. Readings from a Swan-Ganz catheter display the following: central venous pressure (CVP): 4 mmHg, right ventricular pressure (RVP) 20/5 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP): 20/5 mmHg. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP): 5 mm Hg. A chest x-ray is shown as Image A. The patient dies soon after this episode.

"A 76-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents complaining of 3 weeks of cough and progressive dyspnea on exertion in the setting of a 20 pound weight loss. He is a 60 pack-year smoker, worked as a shipbuilder 30 years ago, and recently traveled to Ohio to visit family. Chest radiograph shows increased bronchovascular markings, reticular parenchymal opacities, and multiple pleural plaques. Labs are unremarkable except for a slight anemia. Which of the following is the most likely finding on this patient's chest CT?",E,"Based on the patient's history of COPD, significant smoking history, and the presence of pleural plaques on chest radiograph, the most likely finding on chest CT would be:

A. Nodular mass spreading along pleural surfaces

This finding is suggestive of mesothelioma, a type of cancer that affects the lining of the lungs and is often associated with asbestos exposure. The patient's history of working as a shipbuilder 30 years ago increases the likelihood of asbestos exposure, which is a major risk factor for mesothelioma. The presence of pleural plaques on the chest radiograph also supports this diagnosis, as pleural plaques are often seen in individuals with asbestos exposure.

However, it is important to note that without further diagnostic tests, such as a biopsy, the exact nature of the nodular mass cannot be confirmed. Other findings such as honeycombing (B), which is often seen in interstitial lung diseases, or a lower lobe cavitary mass (E), which could indicate a lung abscess or a cavitating lung cancer, cannot be ruled out without additional information. An air bronchogram (C) is a radiographic sign that can be seen in lung consolidation and is not specific to any particular diagnosis. A granulomatous nodule (D) could be seen in infections or sarcoidosis, but it is less likely given the patient's history and radiographic findings.",Success

Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilateral, a barrel-shaped chest, and measured breathing through pursed lips. A chest X-ray reveals a flattened diaphragm and no signs of consolidation. Pulmonary function testing reveals FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%. Arterial blood gases (ABG) of this patient are most likely to reveal which of the following?",B,"The patient's history and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The decreased FEV1/FVC ratio is consistent with airflow obstruction, which is typical in COPD. The patient's smoking history and symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and recent worsening of symptoms are also indicative of COPD.

In COPD, the patient may develop hypercapnia (increased CO2 levels) due to the reduced ability of the lungs to effectively exhale carbon dioxide. This leads to a primary respiratory acidosis, characterized by an increase in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) and a decrease in pH. The kidneys compensate for this respiratory acidosis by retaining bicarbonate (HCO3-) and excreting hydrogen ions (H+), which can result in a normal or near-normal pH.

Given this context, the most likely arterial blood gas (ABG) finding in this patient would be:

B. Primary respiratory acidosis

The other options are less likely in this scenario:

A. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: This could occur in the setting of renal failure or other conditions but is not the primary disturbance expected in COPD.
C. Primary respiratory alkalosis: This would be characterized by a low PaCO2, which is not expected in a patient with COPD exacerbation.
D. Compensatory respiratory acidosis: This term is not typically used to describe the primary disturbance; it would be a description of the compensatory mechanism in response to metabolic alkalosis, which is not present in this case.
E. Anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis: This would suggest a metabolic acidosis (e.g., due to lactic acidosis or renal failure) and a compensatory respiratory alkalosis, which is not the primary disturbance expected in COPD.",Success
A 34-year-old male suffers from inherited hemophilia A. He and his wife have three unaffected daughters. What is the probability that the second daughter is a carrier of the disease?,E,"The correct answer is C. 50%.

Explanation: Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder. Since the man has hemophilia A, he has an affected X chromosome (Xh) and a Y chromosome. His wife, who is unaffected, has two normal X chromosomes (XX). When they have children, each daughter will receive one X chromosome from the father and one X chromosome from the mother. Since the father's only X chromosome is the affected one, each daughter will receive the affected X chromosome from him. However, they have a 50% chance of receiving a normal X chromosome from the mother and a 50% chance of receiving the affected X chromosome from the mother. Therefore, each of their daughters has a 50% chance of being a carrier of hemophilia A. The fact that their first three daughters are unaffected does not change the probability for the second daughter, as each child's genetic makeup is determined independently.",Success

The patient's history of progressive hearing loss, tinnitus (constant ear ringing), and difficulty understanding speech in background noise are all characteristic of sensorineural hearing loss. The fact that air conduction is greater than bone conduction (as demonstrated by the Rinne test) also supports this diagnosis, as conductive hearing loss would typically show better bone conduction than air conduction. The tympanic membrane, malleus, incus, and stapes (options A-D) are more commonly associated with conductive hearing loss, which is not suggested by the patient's examination findings.",Success

Which of the following tests are indicated to determine the cause of the abnormal dipstick test results?",B,"The abnormal dipstick test results showing 1+ glucose in the urine of a pregnant woman can be indicative of gestational diabetes, which is a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. The presence of glucose in the urine (glycosuria) when blood glucose levels are normal is not typical, but in pregnancy, the renal threshold for glucose can be lowered, leading to glycosuria at lower blood glucose levels. Given the patient's concern and the potential implications for the health of both the mother and the fetus, it is important to investigate further.

The tests indicated to determine the cause of the abnormal dipstick test results are:

A. HbA1c measurement - This test measures the average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months. It is not specific for diagnosing gestational diabetes but can provide useful information about the patient's glucose control.

D. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) - This is the gold standard test for diagnosing gestational diabetes. It involves measuring the blood glucose levels after fasting and then again 1 and 2 hours after consuming a glucose-rich drink. An OGTT is typically recommended for pregnant women with risk factors for gestational diabetes, including those with a BMI over 25 kg/m², and those with a positive dipstick test for glucose.

E. Random plasma glucose - While this test can be used to screen for hyperglycemia, it is not as specific as the OGTT for diagnosing gestational diabetes. However, it can be used as an initial screening tool if the OGTT is not immediately available.

C. Urinalysis - This test can confirm the presence of glucose in the urine but does not determine the cause. It is not a specific test for diagnosing gestational diabetes but can be useful in monitoring the patient's condition.

B. No tests required - This is not an appropriate response given the patient's symptoms and the potential implications of untreated gestational diabetes.

"A 60-year-old man with a history of osteoarthritis has been awaiting hip replacement surgery for 3 years. During his annual physical, he reports that he has been taking over the counter pain medications, but that no amount of analgesics can relieve his constant pain. Laboratory results reveal that his renal function has deteriorated when compared to his last office visit 2 years ago. Serum creatinine is 2.0 mg/dL, and urinalysis shows 1+ proteinuria. There are no abnormalities seen on microscopy of the urine. A renal biopsy shows eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's deterioration in renal function?",D,"The most likely explanation for this patient's deterioration in renal function is D. Toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis. The patient's history of chronic pain management with over-the-counter analgesics, particularly if these include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can lead to nephrotoxicity. The renal biopsy findings of eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation are consistent with a toxic injury to the renal tubules and interstitium, which is characteristic of toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis. This condition can be caused by the prolonged use of certain medications, including NSAIDs, which are commonly used for pain relief in osteoarthritis.",Success

Sensory examination shows decreased sensation to pinprick below the T4 dermatome. He is unable to lie recumbent due to severe pain. An x-ray of the chest shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",B,"The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is:

B. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy

The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of a spinal cord compression due to metastatic disease, likely from lung cancer given his history of smoking and the presence of multiple round opacities in both lungs on chest x-ray. The weakness, hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, and sensory loss below the T4 dermatome are consistent with spinal cord involvement. The pain and inability to lie recumbent are also indicative of significant spinal pathology.

Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation and edema around the spinal cord, potentially alleviating some of the symptoms of spinal cord compression. This therapy is often used in conjunction with other treatments, such as radiation therapy, which may also be necessary in this case. However, among the options given, dexamethasone is the most immediately appropriate to address the patient's symptoms and the potential spinal cord compression.

Options A, C, D, and E are not as appropriate as the initial step in managing this patient's condition:

A. Radiation therapy may be necessary to treat the metastatic disease causing the spinal cord compression, but it is not the immediate treatment to relieve symptoms.

C. Intravenous acyclovir therapy is used to treat viral infections such as herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus. There is no indication that this patient has a viral infection.

D. Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy is used to treat bacterial infections. There is no evidence of a bacterial infection in this patient's presentation.

E. Oral ibuprofen therapy may help with pain management but does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms or the potential spinal cord compression.",Success

He went on a family vacation 15 years ago, and during the flight there was turbulence and a “rough landing”. Since then he has avoided flying. He did not go to his cousin’s wedding because it was out of the country. He also was unable to visit his grandmother for her 80th birthday. The last time his job asked him to meet a client out of state, he drove 18 hours instead of flying. Two years ago he promised his fiancé they could fly to Florida. Upon arrival at the airport, he began to feel dizzy, lightheaded, and refused to go through security. During the clinic visit, the patient appears anxious and distressed. He recognizes that his fear is irrational. He is upset that it is affecting his relationship with his wife.

B. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)

This patient presents with a specific phobia (fear of flying), which is characterized by an intense, irrational fear of a specific object or situation. Cognitive behavioral therapy, particularly exposure therapy, is the most effective treatment for specific phobias. CBT helps the patient confront and manage their fear by gradually exposing them to the feared object or situation in a controlled environment, while teaching them coping strategies to manage their anxiety.

Options A, C, and E (Alprazolam, Fluoxetine, and Zolpidem) are medications that can help manage anxiety symptoms but do not address the underlying phobia or teach the patient coping strategies.

What is the mechanism of action of the prescribed medication?",B,"The symptoms and examination findings described in the case are consistent with heart failure, particularly left-sided heart failure with pulmonary congestion and right-sided heart failure with peripheral edema. The patient's breathlessness, especially on exertion and when lying flat (orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), distended neck veins, and bilateral leg swelling are all indicative of heart failure.

The medication prescribed to the patient, which changes his cardiac physiology as depicted by the dashed line post-medication, likely aims to improve cardiac function and reduce the symptoms of heart failure. Among the options given, the most likely mechanism of action for this medication is:

C. Preferential dilatation of capacitance vessels

This mechanism is characteristic of vasodilators, which can be used in the management of heart failure. Vasodilators, such as nitrates or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, can reduce the preload (volume load) on the heart by dilating the veins (capacitance vessels), which decreases venous return to the heart and, in turn, reduces the workload on the heart. This can help alleviate symptoms such as dyspnea and peripheral edema in heart failure patients.

Options A, B, D, and E are not the primary mechanisms for managing heart failure symptoms in this context:

A. Decrease in the slope of the pacemaker potential would slow down heart rate, which might be beneficial in some cases, but it is not the primary mechanism for improving symptoms in heart failure.

B. Decrease in transmembrane sodium gradient is related to the action of sodium channel blockers, which are not typically used in heart failure.

D. Inhibition of aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption is a mechanism of action for diuretics and aldosterone antagonists, which can be used in heart failure to reduce fluid retention but do not directly change cardiac physiology as described.

E. Reduction in myocardial contractility would be counterproductive in heart failure, as the goal is often to improve contractility to enhance cardiac output.",Success

Neuroblastomas are a type of cancer that develops from immature nerve cells, often found in the adrenal gland or along the spine in the sympathetic nervous system. They can also occur in the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis. Given the location of the mass in the upper right abdomen, it is likely that this is an adrenal neuroblastoma.

The histopathologic examination of a neuroblastoma typically shows small, round, blue cells that are arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil (option D). The cells are small and round with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios, and they often have stippled chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. The rosette formation is characteristic of neuroblastomas and is due to the cells' tendency to surround a central neuropil-like substance.

Among the options provided, the one most directly associated with an increased risk in a patient with PCOS is:

B. Endometrial carcinoma

Women with PCOS are at increased risk for endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer due to chronic anovulation (lack of ovulation) leading to unopposed estrogen exposure. The lack of regular ovulation means that the endometrium (lining of the uterus) is not regularly shed through menstruation, which can lead to a buildup and increased risk of precancerous changes and cancer. Therefore, it is important for women with PCOS to be monitored for signs of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.

Dermatopathology determines that the lesion contains neoplastic cells of melanocytic origin. Which of the following characteristics of the lesion would likely be found on physical examination?",A,"A. Brown-black color in one area of the lesion to red-white in a different area

The presence of neoplastic cells of melanocytic origin suggests a diagnosis of melanoma, which is a type of skin cancer that can arise from melanocytes (the cells that produce pigment). One of the key characteristics of melanoma is its irregular pigmentation, which can manifest as different colors within the same lesion. This can range from brown to black in one area, to red or white in another area, making option A the most likely characteristic of the lesion on physical examination.

Melanomas often exhibit the ABCDE criteria, which stands for Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter greater than 6mm, and Evolving change in size, shape, color, or symptoms. The options provided can be evaluated against these criteria:

- B (Macule that is 5mm in diameter) and E (Symmetrical ovoid macule) do not fit the typical characteristics of a melanoma, as they do not meet the size criteria (greater than 6mm) and do not exhibit asymmetry or irregular borders.
- C (Well-circumscribed papule with smooth borders) is also unlikely, as melanomas typically have irregular borders.

The most appropriate next step in management would be to restrict fluid intake to decrease the amount of water being retained by the kidneys and allow the serum sodium to increase. Therefore, the answer is D. Fluid restriction.",Success
"An 18-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her mother for vaginal bleeding. The mother states that she noticed the bleeding today, which appeared as brown discharge with clots in the patient’s diaper. The mother denies frequent nosebleeds or easy bruising. She also denies any known trauma. She does mention that the patient has been limping and complaining of left leg pain since a fall 2 months ago. On physical exam, there are multiple 2-3 cm hyperpigmented patches on the patient’s trunk. There is bilateral enlargement of the breasts but no pubic hair. The vaginal orifice is normal and clear with an intact hymen. A plain radiograph of the left lower leg shows patchy areas of lytic bone and sclerosis within the femoral metaphysis. Which of the following is associated with the patient’s most likely diagnosis?",E,"The patient's symptoms and findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of McCune-Albright syndrome, which is characterized by the triad of precocious puberty, café-au-lait spots, and bone lesions. The bone lesions in this syndrome are often due to fibrous dysplasia. The plain radiograph showing patchy areas of lytic bone and sclerosis within the femoral metaphysis is consistent with this diagnosis. Of the options given, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (Option E) is the finding most associated with the patient's likely diagnosis. However, it should be noted that McCune-Albright syndrome is not explicitly listed among the options, but polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is a key component of this syndrome.",Success
A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital for treatment of unstable angina. Cardiac catheterization shows occlusion that has caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery. Resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased by what factor relative to a vessel with no occlusion?,B,"The correct answer is B. 16.

The relationship between the diameter of a vessel and its resistance to blood flow can be described by the Poiseuille's Law, which states that the resistance (R) is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius (r) of the vessel:

\[ R \propto \frac{1}{r^4} \]

If the diameter of the artery is reduced by 50%, then the radius is also reduced by 50%. Let's say the original radius is \(r\). After the reduction, the new radius is \(0.5r\). We can calculate the change in resistance as follows:

\[ R_{original} \propto \frac{1}{r^4} \]

\[ R_{new} \propto \frac{1}{(0.5r)^4} = \frac{1}{(0.5)^4r^4} = \frac{1}{0.0625r^4} = 16 \cdot \frac{1}{r^4} \]

\[ \frac{R_{new}}{R_{original}} = 16 \]

Therefore, the resistance to blood flow in the vessel has increased by a factor of 16 relative to a vessel with no occlusion.",Success
"A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an irregular gait 3 days after receiving age-appropriate vaccinations. Examination of the lower extremities shows no redness or swelling. When the child stands on his right leg, his left leg drops and his pelvis tilts towards the left. Sensation to light touch is normal in both legs. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to the injection of the vaccine into which of the following locations?",D,"The symptoms described in the question suggest that the child has developed a condition known as sciatic nerve palsy, which can occur as a rare complication of an injection in the buttock area. The sciatic nerve is the largest nerve in the body and runs from the lower back down through the buttock and into the leg. If it is injured or compressed during an injection, it can lead to symptoms such as weakness or paralysis in the leg, as well as altered gait.

The sciatic nerve runs through the lower part of the buttock, exiting the pelvis through the greater sciatic notch. It is particularly vulnerable to injury when injections are given in the lower (inferior) part of the buttock, especially in the lateral (outer) aspect, where it is less protected by muscle.

Given that the child's symptoms are more pronounced when he stands on his right leg, with his left leg dropping and his pelvis tilting towards the left, it suggests that the left leg is affected. This indicates that the injection most likely occurred in the buttock on the opposite side, which is the right buttock in this case.

Considering the location of the sciatic nerve and the symptoms presented, the injection that most likely caused the sciatic nerve palsy was given in the inferolateral quadrant of the right buttock.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A. Inferolateral quadrant of the right buttock",Success
"A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of decreased appetite and abdominal pain for the last several weeks. Physical examination shows a well-appearing toddler with a palpable left-sided abdominal mass that does not cross the midline. A CT of the abdomen shows a large, necrotic tumor on the left kidney. Histological examination of the kidney mass shows primitive blastemal cells and immature tubules and glomeruli. This tissue is most likely derived from the same embryological structure as which of the following?",D,"The tissue described in the question is most likely derived from the same embryological structure as the adrenal medulla (Option B).

Explanation: The clinical presentation and the histological findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Wilms' tumor, a type of kidney cancer that occurs in children. Wilms' tumor is characterized by the presence of blastemal, stromal, and epithelial elements, which are derived from the metanephric blastema, the embryonic precursor of the kidney. The adrenal medulla, like the kidney, is derived from the intermediate mesoderm, which is the embryonic structure that gives rise to the urogenital system. The other options listed (carotid body, thyroid gland, papillary muscles, and anterior pituitary) are derived from different embryological structures and are not related to the intermediate mesoderm.",Success
"A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an increasing difficulty in hearing over the past several months. His mother says they have to speak at a higher volume for him to understand them. He also complains of having difficulty reading his favorite books because he is not able to see the words clearly. His father received a renal transplant in his 20s. The vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:

Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive hearing loss, ocular abnormalities, and renal disease. The renal involvement often presents with hematuria, proteinuria, and can progress to renal failure. The bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss and anterior lenticonus noted in the ophthalmologic examination are also typical features of Alport syndrome. The family history of renal transplantation in the father further supports this diagnosis, as Alport syndrome can be inherited in an X-linked, autosomal recessive, or autosomal dominant pattern.",Success
"A 16-year-old female presents to her primary care physician due to lack of menstruation. She has never had a period and is anxious that she is not “keeping up” with her friends. She states that her breasts began developing when she was 13, and she had a growth spurt around the same time. Review of systems reveals that she has also been getting headaches every few months over the last year with some photosensitivity and nausea each time. Ibuprofen relieves her symptoms. The patient is a competitive ice skater and has never been sexually active. Her mother has a history of migraine headaches, and her older sister has a history of bipolar disorder. Both underwent menarche at age 15. At this visit, the patient’s temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 118/65 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Her body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Both breasts are Tanner IV with no expressable discharge. Pelvic and axillary hair growth is also Tanner IV. The patient is unable to tolerate a full pelvic exam, but the part of the vaginal canal that is examined is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are ordered and are below:

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
K+: 4.1 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL
Glucose: 73 mg/dL
Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL

Mg2+: 1.7 mEq/L
AST: 11 U/L
ALT: 11 U/L
Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH): 16.2 mIU/mL (4.7-21.5 mIU/ml)
Estrogen: 240 pg/mL (64-357 pg/mL)

Abdominal ultrasound is performed and shows a normal uterus and ovaries. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is E. Normal development. The patient's history of breast development at age 13 and a growth spurt around the same time, along with her current Tanner staging for breast and pubic hair development (Tanner IV), suggests that she is progressing through puberty. The fact that her mother and sister also had late onset of menarche (age 15) suggests that there may be a familial pattern of delayed puberty.

The laboratory results are within normal limits, except for slightly elevated FSH levels (16.2 mIU/mL, normal range 4.7-21.5 mIU/mL) and normal estrogen levels (240 pg/mL, normal range 64-357 pg/mL). Elevated FSH can indicate that the ovaries are not responding as expected to the hormone, but in the context of her late-onset puberty and normal estrogen levels, this may simply reflect her current stage of development.

The abdominal ultrasound showing a normal uterus and ovaries further supports the diagnosis of normal development. The other options (A. Hypothalamic amenorrhea, B. Hyperprolactinemia, C. Imperforate hymen, D. Vaginal septum) do not seem to fit the clinical presentation as well, given the lack of symptoms or findings that would suggest these conditions.

The patient's headaches with photosensitivity and nausea are likely migraines, given her mother's history of migraines and the fact that they are relieved by ibuprofen. These symptoms are not directly related to her amenorrhea and may be coincidental.",Success

The next morning on rounds, he complains of eleven episodes of diarrhea and near-constant flatulence overnight. His mental status has improved and his hand tremor has resolved. Which of the following medications did this patient most likely receive after admission?",B,"The patient's symptoms and the improvement in his condition suggest that he was likely treated with lactulose (Option B). Lactulose is used in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, a condition characterized by altered mental status, flapping tremor (asterixis), and often, jaundice (scleral icterus) due to liver failure. Lactulose works by reducing the absorption of ammonia and other toxins in the gut that can lead to hepatic encephalopathy.

His temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 16/min. A review of the patient’s medical record reveals colonoscopy results from 1 year ago. Relevant findings included multiple small, pedunculated polyps which were removed, multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings, and no other masses. This patient’s condition is most strongly associated with which of the following disorders?",C,"The patient's symptoms and medical history are most strongly associated with a condition that is not listed among the options provided. Given the patient's history of abdominal pain, constipation, and the findings from his previous colonoscopy, the most likely diagnosis is diverticulitis. Diverticulitis is a condition where the diverticula (small, bulging sacs that can form in the lining of the colon) become inflamed or infected. This can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, particularly in the lower left side of the abdomen, but in some cases, the pain can be on the right side. Constipation is also a common symptom. The patient's history of multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings (diverticula) on colonoscopy supports this diagnosis.

However, among the options provided, none directly relates to diverticulitis. If we must choose from the given options, none of them are strongly associated with the patient's symptoms and medical history. But for the sake of answering the question, we can eliminate options that are clearly unrelated:

A. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs and liver, not the colon.
B. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disorder affects the kidneys, not the colon.
C. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders affecting the connective tissues, but it is not typically associated with abdominal pain or constipation.
D. Goodpasture syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease that primarily affects the kidneys and lungs.
E. Menetrier disease is a rare disorder characterized by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the gastric mucosa, which does not typically present with the symptoms described.

Given these options, none of them are a clear fit for the patient's symptoms and history. However, if we must choose, the least unrelated option might be Menetrier disease (E), as it involves the gastrointestinal tract, but it is still not a strong association with the patient's presentation.

"A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with sudden onset of slurred speech. The patient’s eldest daughter says that he couldn’t move his arm during the episode. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and a hemorrhagic stroke 6 years ago, which was treated surgically. After admission, the patient gets increasingly worse and loses consciousness. A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain. The patient’s daughter is asked to consent to a non-emergent, life-saving operation since the patient is in a comatose state. She does not consent to the operation even though the physician stresses it would be life-saving. Upon further discussion, the physician finds out that the patient was abusive and neglectful to his children, and the daughter wants “to live in peace.” The patient has no written advanced directive. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?",C,"The most appropriate course of action in this scenario is to refer the case to the court (Option B). Given the complex ethical issues at play, including the patient's lack of a written advanced directive, the daughter's refusal of consent based on personal reasons, and the life-saving nature of the proposed surgery, a court can provide a legal framework for decision-making. A judge may appoint a guardian or conservator to make medical decisions on behalf of the patient if there is no clear legal directive or if the existing family members are unable or unwilling to consent.

A 50-year-old man with congestive heart failure (CHF) was started on an experimental analog of atrial natriuretic peptide. Which of the following would he expect to experience?,C,"The correct answer is C. Increased glomerular filtration rate, restricted aldosterone release, vascular smooth muscle dilation.

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) has several effects that are beneficial in congestive heart failure (CHF). ANP causes vasodilation by relaxing vascular smooth muscle, which decreases the preload and afterload on the heart, making it easier for the heart to pump. It also inhibits the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), reducing aldosterone release, which decreases sodium and water reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to a decrease in blood volume and blood pressure. Additionally, ANP increases glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which helps to eliminate excess sodium and water from the body.",Success

On physical examination, the patient is unconscious with a GCS of 9/15 and is cyanotic. There are open fractures of the left femur and left tibia, a likely shoulder dislocation, multiple contusions on the limbs and thorax, and a puncture wound on the left side of his chest. There are no breath sounds on the left side and there is hyperresonance to percussion on the left. Preparations are made for an emergency needle thoracostomy to be performed to treat this patient’s likely tension pneumothorax. Which one of the following is the best choice to provide informed consent for this procedure?",D,"In the scenario provided, the patient is unconscious and in a critical condition requiring immediate medical intervention. In such situations, where the patient is unable to provide informed consent and there is an immediate threat to life, medical professionals are typically guided by the principle of implied consent. Implied consent allows healthcare providers to perform life-saving procedures without explicit consent from the patient or their family when there is no time to obtain it and the patient's condition is critical.

Given the urgency of the situation and the need to perform an emergency needle thoracostomy to treat the likely tension pneumothorax, the correct answer is:

D. Informed consent is not needed in this case

However, it is important to note that once the patient's condition is stabilized or as soon as possible thereafter, efforts should be made to involve the patient's family or legal representatives in decision-making processes regarding the patient's care. In cases where the patient is incapacitated and no immediate family or legal representatives are available, hospitals may have policies in place regarding who can make medical decisions on behalf of the patient, which may involve the hospital ethics committee or other legal mechanisms.",Success
A group of researchers wants to evaluate how often the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is related to high-risk behaviors in female sex workers from their country. An additional aim is to evaluate the association between HIV acquisition and certain sociodemographic factors. The researchers collect data through interviewer-administered questionnaires (for behavioral and sociodemographic data) as well as through clinical and serological evaluation/screening methods for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Which of the following could be the main outcome measure of their study?,B,"The main outcome measure of their study could be either A. Incidence or B. Prevalence, depending on the specific research question they are trying to answer.

A. Incidence would be the measure of new cases of HIV among female sex workers over a specific period of time. This would be useful to understand the rate at which HIV is being acquired in this population.

B. Prevalence would be the measure of the total number of existing cases of HIV among female sex workers at a particular point in time or during a specified period. This would give an idea of the burden of HIV in this population.

Both measures could be relevant, but if the researchers are particularly interested in understanding the rate of new HIV infections in relation to high-risk behaviors and sociodemographic factors, then incidence would be the more appropriate measure. If they are interested in the overall presence of HIV in this population, then prevalence would be more relevant. 

For the association between HIV acquisition and certain sociodemographic factors, they might also use D. Relative risk or E. Attributable risk as additional outcome measures. Relative risk compares the risk of HIV acquisition in the exposed group (those with certain high-risk behaviors or sociodemographic factors) to the risk in the unexposed group. Attributable risk measures the proportion of HIV cases that can be attributed to specific risk factors.",Success

Among the options given, the process most likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition is:

D. Impaired degradation of β-catenin

This is because colorectal cancer is often associated with mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, which leads to the accumulation of β-catenin. β-catenin is a key protein in the Wnt signaling pathway, and its accumulation can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and division, contributing to the development of colorectal cancer.",Success

Examination shows a distended, rigid abdomen and hypoactive bowel sounds. Fluid resuscitation is initiated. In addition to complete bowel rest, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?",D,"The most appropriate next step in management of this patient is an abdominal CT scan with contrast (Option B). This imaging modality will help evaluate the extent of the ulcerative colitis, assess for complications such as toxic megacolon, and rule out other causes of acute abdomen. Given the patient's worsening symptoms, fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, there is a concern for a severe flare-up or complication of her ulcerative colitis, and a CT scan can provide crucial information for guiding further management.",Success
"A 55-year-old man recovering from knee replacement surgery complains of breathlessness in the postoperative ward. He has been confined to bed for the past 5 days and is under observation. He felt a sudden difficulty in breathing and called for the ward nurse. He says that he is unable to take deep breaths and has a sharp pain on the right side of his chest with each inspiration. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.8°F), the pulse is 111/min, the respirations are 31/min, and the blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. He experiences pain in his right calf on dorsiflexion. There are no other prominent findings on physical examination. His chest X-ray does not show anything significant. The ECG reveals sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the best course of management at this time?",A,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible pulmonary embolism (PE), which is a serious complication that can occur after surgery, especially in patients who have been bedridden for an extended period. The symptoms of sudden breathlessness, chest pain on inspiration, and tachycardia are consistent with PE. Additionally, the pain in the right calf on dorsiflexion could indicate a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a common source of emboli that can lead to PE.

Given the clinical presentation, the best initial step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis of PE. A CT scan with contrast (CT pulmonary angiogram) is the gold standard for diagnosing PE and should be performed as soon as possible. Therefore, option B (CT scan) is the correct choice.

Options A (subcutaneous fondaparinux), C (inferior vena cava filter), and D (ventilation-perfusion scan) are all potential treatments or diagnostic tests for PE, but they should be considered after a diagnosis has been confirmed. Option E (lower extremity doppler) could be useful to diagnose a DVT, which might be the source of the embolus, but it does not address the immediate concern of a possible PE.

Therefore, the best course of management at this time is:

B. CT scan",Success
"A 62-year-old man is brought to his primary care physician by his wife who is concerned about the patient's frequent falls. Approximately 6 months ago, she started noticing that he was walking more slowly than usual. He has fallen more than 6 times in the past month, and she is worried that he will sustain a serious injury if he does not stop falling. The patient is a retired banking executive and was active as a triathlete until the age of 60. He does not smoke and drinks 2-3 alcoholic beverages per day. His family history is notable for normal pressure hydrocephalus in his mother and Alzheimer dementia in his father. His temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 131/81 mmHg, pulse is 68/min, and respirations are 19/min. On exam, his movements appear slowed and forced. He shuffles his feet when he walks. Tone is increased in his upper and lower extremities bilaterally. This patient's condition is most strongly associated with which of the following histologic findings on brain autopsy?",D,"The patient's symptoms, including slow movements, shuffling gait, and increased tone in the upper and lower extremities, are most consistent with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the presence of intracellular inclusions known as Lewy bodies, which are primarily composed of aggregated alpha-synuclein protein. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D. Intracellular inclusions of alpha-synuclein

The other options are associated with different neurological conditions. For example, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by extracellular aggregates of amyloid beta (option C) and intracellular inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau (option E). Normal pressure hydrocephalus, which the patient's mother had, is not typically associated with specific histological findings on brain autopsy but rather with ventricular enlargement on imaging studies.",Success
"A 16-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a regular check-up. His mother says that he has not yet begun to walk. He is exclusively breastfed. He is at the 20th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 50th percentile for head circumference. Physical examination shows erosion of the enamel on the lingual surface of the incisors and carious molars. He has frontal bossing. His wrists are widened, his legs appear bowed, and there is beading of the ribs. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?",C,"The patient's presentation, including enamel erosion, carious teeth, frontal bossing, widened wrists, bowed legs, and beading of the ribs, is most consistent with rickets. Rickets is a disease that results from vitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus deficiency, which affects bone mineralization in growing children. The bowing of the legs and beading of the ribs are characteristic signs of rickets. The patient's dietary history of being exclusively breastfed is relevant because breast milk is relatively low in vitamin D, and without supplementation, vitamin D deficiency can occur, leading to rickets.

Option C, ""Impaired growth plate mineralization,"" is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition, as it directly relates to the pathophysiology of rickets. Rickets occurs when there is a failure of mineralization at the growth plates due to a lack of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphorus, leading to the characteristic skeletal deformities and dental abnormalities seen in this patient.

Options A, B, D, and E are not as directly related to the clinical presentation described. A deficiency of the cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase (option A) would affect collagen synthesis but would not typically present with the specific signs of rickets. A defect in type I collagen (option B) would be associated with a connective tissue disorder such as osteogenesis imperfecta, which has a different presentation. Impaired osteoclast-mediated bone resorption (option D) would lead to conditions like osteopetrosis, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation. A mutation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (option E) is associated with skeletal dysplasias such as achondroplasia, which also has a different presentation from rickets.",Success

Labs are obtained and pending. Which of the following therapies is most likely indicated?",B,"The patient's symptoms of dysarthria (slurred speech) and left-sided facial droop are indicative of a stroke, specifically an ischemic stroke, which occurs when a blood vessel supplying blood to the brain is obstructed. Given the urgency of the situation and the potential for alteplase to be effective if given within the appropriate time window (typically within 3-4.5 hours of symptom onset), the most likely indicated therapy in this case is:

A. Alteplase

Alteplase is a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that helps dissolve the blood clot causing the stroke. It is crucial to administer this medication as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms to improve outcomes and reduce the risk of permanent brain damage. The patient's history of sickle cell disease does not preclude her from receiving alteplase if she meets the other criteria for treatment.

The right knee is swollen. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",E,"The most appropriate next step in management for this patient would be A. Focussed assessment sonography for trauma (FAST). This is a quick and non-invasive ultrasound examination used to detect the presence of free fluid in the pericardial space or abdominal cavities, which could indicate internal bleeding. Given the patient's history of acute myeloid leukemia and chemotherapy, he may be at increased risk for bleeding and his multiple injuries suggest potential internal injuries. The FAST scan can help prioritize further diagnostic steps and guide the need for immediate surgical intervention.

However, it's important to note that the patient's decreased breath sounds over the right lung base and tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall also suggest the possibility of a pneumothorax or hemothorax, which would require immediate attention. If the FAST scan does not reveal immediate life-threatening injuries, option B. Insertion of intercostal chest tube, may also be necessary to address potential chest injuries.

Additionally, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score of 10 (E3M6V1) indicates moderate to severe head injury, making option C. CT scan of the head and neck, a necessary step in the management of this patient to rule out intracranial injuries.

Given the patient's multiple injuries and altered mental status, option E. Intubation and mechanical ventilation, may also be necessary to protect the airway and ensure adequate oxygenation.

The constellation of symptoms is consistent with opioid withdrawal. 

Given this context, the appropriate treatment for this patient's symptoms would be an agent that can help manage opioid withdrawal. Among the options provided, Clonidine (option A) is commonly used in the treatment of opioid withdrawal due to its ability to reduce the sympathetic overdrive that is characteristic of withdrawal symptoms. Clonidine can help alleviate symptoms such as agitation, anxiety, hypertension, tachycardia, sweating, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

Options B, C, D, and E are not specifically indicated for the treatment of opioid withdrawal:
- Diazepam taper (option B) might be used to manage anxiety or seizures in some withdrawal scenarios but is not the first-line treatment for opioid withdrawal.

She wants to overcome her extreme and irrational fear. Which of the following is the most effective treatment to overcome this patient’s arachnophobia?",A,"The most effective treatment to overcome the patient’s arachnophobia is:

A. Desensitization

Desensitization, also known as exposure therapy, is a form of psychotherapy that is particularly effective for treating phobias such as arachnophobia. This technique involves gradually exposing the patient to the feared object or situation in a controlled environment, allowing them to confront and eventually overcome their fear. Desensitization can be conducted through various methods, including in vivo (real-life) exposure, virtual reality, or imaginal exposure. The goal is to help the patient learn to manage their anxiety and develop coping strategies when faced with the feared stimulus.

While medications such as paroxetine (B), metoprolol (C), and alprazolam (D) can help manage anxiety symptoms, they do not address the underlying fear and are not considered first-line treatments for phobias.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",E,"Based on the patient's symptoms and the CT scan results, which are not shown here but presumably indicate some form of brain pathology, the most appropriate next step in management would be:

C. Cerebral shunting

The patient's symptoms of increasing forgetfulness, unsteadiness, and falls, along with the worsening of symptoms after each fall, suggest a possible diagnosis of Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH). NPH is characterized by gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment. The presence of a bruise over the left temple and the Babinski sign on the left could indicate increased intracranial pressure or a localized neurological deficit. A CT scan can help confirm the diagnosis by showing ventricular enlargement without significant cortical atrophy.

Cerebral shunting, specifically a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, is a surgical procedure used to treat NPH by draining excess cerebrospinal fluid from the ventricles of the brain to the peritoneal cavity, thus relieving symptoms. This is the most appropriate next step in management given the described symptoms and likely findings on the CT scan.

Options A, B, D, and E are not as appropriate for the management of this patient's condition:

D. Tetrabenazine therapy is used for the treatment of chorea, which is not a symptom of NPH.

E. Cognitive training may be beneficial for dementia patients, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which appears to be NPH. Cognitive training could be considered as an adjunct to treatment after addressing the primary neurological issue.",Success
"A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 39 weeks gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. On examination, the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated. After 5 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration of the fetal heart rate to 90/min. A decision to perform an episiotomy is made to expedite vaginal delivery. The anesthesiologist locates the ischial spines by palpating the posterolateral vaginal sidewall and administers an anesthetic. Three minutes later, pinching the posterior vulva does not provoke pain. The anesthetized nerve most likely also supplies which of the following structures?",C,"The anesthetized nerve most likely also supplies the external anal sphincter (Option C). The nerve that is typically anesthetized in this scenario is the pudendal nerve, which provides sensory innervation to the perineum, including the skin of the perineum, the external anal sphincter, and the lower part of the rectum. The other options do not receive innervation from the pudendal nerve.",Success
"A 55-year-old woman with a history of HIV presents to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea, fever, and dry cough for the past 4 days. She has not been compliant with antiretroviral or prophylactic medication. On evaluation, the patient is in moderate respiratory distress. The temperature is 38.8°C (102.0°F), the blood pressure is 124/82 mm Hg, the pulse is 96/min, and the respiratory rate is 20/min. Pulse oximetry is 92% on 4 L oxygen by nasal cannula. Her CD4 count is 180 cells/μL. IV antibiotics and glucocorticoids are administered. After 30 minutes, the patient develops severe respiratory distress. Repeat vital signs show: temperature 38.3°C (101.0°F), blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg, pulse 104/min, respiration rate 32/min and pulse oximetry 85% on nasal cannula. The trachea deviates to the left. Breath sounds are absent on the right side and the neck veins are distended. Telemetry shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?",D,"The best next step in the management of this patient is D. Needle thoracostomy. The patient's sudden severe respiratory distress, deviation of the trachea, absent breath sounds on the right side, and distended neck veins suggest the possibility of a tension pneumothorax, which is a medical emergency. Needle thoracostomy is an appropriate immediate intervention to relieve the tension and stabilize the patient's condition before definitive treatment can be arranged.",Success
A 22-year-old woman with polycystic ovarian syndrome comes to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of left lower abdominal pain that began suddenly while she was running. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. Physical examination shows tenderness to palpation over the left adnexa and rebound tenderness in the left lower quadrant. There is no tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Urine pregnancy test is negative. An ultrasound is ordered to confirm the diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst. Visualization of fluid in which of the following locations would be most consistent with this diagnosis?,B,"B. Rectouterine pouch

A ruptured ovarian cyst would most likely result in fluid accumulation in the rectouterine pouch (also known as the pouch of Douglas), which is the lowest part of the peritoneal cavity in the female anatomy. This area is directly posterior to the uterus and is where fluid or blood would gravitate if there were a rupture of an ovarian cyst.",Success
"A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She has noticed trembling of her hands for the past 5 months. These movements are only present when she reaches to pick up an object or answer the phone. She has a history of major depressive disorder but has been off medications for the past 3 years. Her father had Parkinson's disease and died 6 months ago. She drinks a glass of wine daily. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 118/74 mm Hg. A low-frequency tremor is present that worsens as she reaches out for an object. She consistently overshoots her target. There is no tremor present when her arms are held outstretched. There is increased tone in the lower extremities and Babinski's sign is positive bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"The patient's symptoms, including a low-frequency tremor that worsens with intentional movements, overshooting her target, and increased tone in the lower extremities with positive Babinski's sign, are most consistent with a diagnosis related to the central nervous system with features of both a tremor and signs of upper motor neuron disease. The presence of a positive Babinski's sign, which is an upward-going plantar reflex, is a clear indicator of upper motor neuron involvement, typically seen in conditions affecting the corticospinal tract.

Given the constellation of symptoms and the patient's history, the most likely cause of her symptoms is not essential tremor (Option D), which would not explain the increased tone and positive Babinski's sign, nor is it likely to be cerebellar demyelination (Option A), which would typically present with ataxia and a different type of tremor (intention tremor) without the upper motor neuron signs.

Options B (degenerated substantia nigra) and E (subthalamic nucleus stroke) both involve structures in the basal ganglia and could potentially explain the tremor. However, only Option B (degenerated substantia nigra) is consistent with Parkinson's disease, which is known to run in families and is suggested by the patient's family history. Parkinson's disease can present with a resting tremor, but it can also present with a postural or action tremor, as well as rigidity and bradykinesia. The positive Babinski's sign and increased tone in the lower extremities could be secondary to the basal ganglia dysfunction affecting the corticospinal tract.

Option C (degenerated caudate nucleus) is less likely because the caudate nucleus is part of the striatum, and its degeneration is more commonly associated with movement disorders like Huntington's disease, which typically presents with chorea rather than the symptoms described.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is:

B. Degenerated substantia nigra

This diagnosis is consistent with Parkinson's disease, which can present with a variety of motor symptoms including tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, as well as non-motor symptoms such as anxiety. The involvement of the corticospinal tract, indicated by the positive Babinski's sign, could be secondary to the disease process affecting the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits.",Success
"A 52-year-old man comes to the physician because of generalized pruritus and raised, erythematous plaques on the skin over his hands, chest, and legs for 6 hours. He reports having clear liquid discharge from his nose and sneezing. He says that his symptoms began suddenly the previous night, 30 minutes after he had dinner at a seafood restaurant. He has had similar symptoms occasionally in the past as well. Four months ago, he had an episode of narrow-angle glaucoma. He takes no medications. His vital signs are within normal limits. Nasal exam shows clear, serous secretions, with edematous and erythematous mucosa and turbinates. Paranasal sinuses are not tender to palpation. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",C,"The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms is:

C. Fexofenadine

The patient's symptoms of generalized pruritus, erythematous plaques, clear liquid nasal discharge, and sneezing that began suddenly after eating at a seafood restaurant suggest an allergic reaction, likely to the seafood. Fexofenadine is a second-generation antihistamine that is effective for treating allergic symptoms such as hives, itching, and nasal symptoms. It is preferred over first-generation antihistamines like diphenhydramine because it causes less sedation and does not have anticholinergic side effects.

Amoxicillin (option B) is an antibiotic and would not be appropriate for treating an allergic reaction. Vitamin K (option D) is used to treat bleeding disorders and would not be relevant to this patient's symptoms. Calamine lotion (option E) can be used topically for symptomatic relief of itching but does not address the underlying allergic reaction or nasal symptoms.",Success

Which of the following psychological defense mechanisms is he demonstrating?",C,"The psychological defense mechanism that the 19-year-old man is demonstrating is most likely C. Reaction formation. Reaction formation is a defense mechanism in which a person unconsciously represses unacceptable impulses or desires and instead acts in a way that is the opposite of those impulses. In this case, the man may have repressed his own same-sex attractions and instead joined a hate group and participated in an attack on a gay couple, which is the opposite of accepting and acting on those attractions. This behavior is a way for him to distance himself from his own unacceptable impulses and to prove to himself and others that he is not gay.",Success

A. Primary hyperparathyroidism

Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by the overproduction of PTH by one or more of the parathyroid glands, which leads to hypercalcemia. This condition can cause symptoms such as kidney stones (nephrolithiasis), bone pain, and fatigue, which are consistent with the patient's presentation.

A 23-year-old woman presents to her psychiatrist concerned about her mood. She has felt tired and unwilling to engage in any activities lately. She states that her limbs feel heavy all the time and that completing any activity takes tremendous effort. She no longer finds any happiness in activities that she previously enjoyed. She also states that she really struggles to sleep and at times can't sleep for several days. The patient is started on appropriate first-line therapy and sent home. She returns 1 week later stating that her symptoms have not improved. She is requesting help as her performance at work and school is suffering. Which of the following is the best next step in management?,D,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with a major depressive disorder. She has been started on appropriate first-line therapy, which is typically an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) or an SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor). Since she has not responded to the initial treatment after one week, it is important to note that antidepressants can take several weeks to show full effects. However, if the patient is still experiencing significant distress and functional impairment, it may be necessary to adjust her treatment plan.

Option A, adding lithium to the treatment regimen, is not typically the first choice for augmentation in depression. Lithium is more commonly used for bipolar disorder and sometimes for treatment-resistant depression, but it is not usually added this early in the treatment course.

Option B, changing treatment to duloxetine, could be considered. Duloxetine is an SNRI and may be effective for this patient, especially if she was initially started on an SSRI. However, switching medications may not be necessary at this early stage.

Option C, changing treatment to lithium, is not indicated as a first-line treatment for major depressive disorder.

Option D, continuing current therapy, is reasonable given that antidepressants can take 4-6 weeks to reach full efficacy. However, since the patient is reporting significant distress and functional impairment, it may be necessary to consider additional interventions.

Option E, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), is an effective treatment for severe depression, especially when medication has failed or when there is a need for a rapid response due to severe symptoms. However, ECT is typically considered after multiple medication trials have failed, not after one week of treatment.

Given the urgency of the patient's situation and her request for help due to suffering at work and school, the best next step would be to consider augmenting her current therapy with a medication that has a different mechanism of action or to consider a more rapid-acting intervention. Since changing medications or adding lithium is not the best first step, and ECT is too extreme at this stage, the most reasonable option is to consider adding a medication that can complement the current therapy, such as a medication with a different mechanism of action or a medication that can help with sleep, which is a significant issue for the patient.

However, none of the options provided exactly match this recommendation. If we must choose from the given options, Option B, changing treatment to duloxetine, could be considered if the patient was initially on an SSRI, as duloxetine has a different mechanism of action and may help with her symptoms, including sleep. But it is important to note that this decision should be made in the context of a thorough evaluation and discussion with the patient about the potential benefits and side effects of this change.",Success
"A 16-year-old patient presents to the physician’s office with an absence of menstruations. Her last period was 6 months ago.

A bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits. Which statement about this patient’s condition is correct?",C,"The correct statement about this patient's condition is:

C. Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient.

Explanation: The patient's history of intentional weight loss through diet restriction and intensive exercise, along with her amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), suggests a diagnosis of hypothalamic amenorrhea due to low body weight. The loss of 18 kg (39.7 lb) and her decreased adiposity can lead to hypoestrogenemia, which is a decrease in estrogen levels. Estrogen is produced in adipose tissue, and a significant loss of body fat can result in lower estrogen production, leading to menstrual irregularities or cessation.

Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Abdominal ultrasonography show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?""",A,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is A. Factitious disorder. The patient's symptoms, including fatigue, lower abdominal pain, and her conviction that she has cancer, along with her request for a diagnostic laparoscopy, could suggest that she is intentionally producing or exaggerating symptoms. The physical examination findings of pale conjunctivae, dry mucous membranes, and the presence of numerous crusts along the course of her left arm veins (which could indicate self-inflicted injuries or repeated self-injections) support this diagnosis. Additionally, her laboratory results do not indicate any acute small bowel hemorrhage, and her abdominal ultrasonography is normal, ruling out E. Acute small bowel hemorrhage. Her serum calcium level is low, which does not suggest D. Primary hyperparathyroidism. The absence of any clear organic cause for her symptoms, along with her psychological state (tiredness, depressed mood), makes B.

The patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and liver biopsy results are consistent with hemolytic anemia leading to liver damage. The jaundice, elevated bilirubin levels (both total and direct), and the presence of hemoglobin in the blood (indicated by the hemoglobin count) suggest that there has been significant red blood cell destruction. The anemia could have been triggered by the transfusion she received, possibly due to an incompatible blood type or an immune reaction to the transfused blood.

"A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by the police. He was found unconscious and covered in bruises outside of a local bar. The patient has a past medical history of polysubstance abuse, depression, multiple suicide attempts, neuropathic pain, and schizophrenia.

PaO2: 70 mm Hg
Bicarbonate: 24 mEq/L

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s current presentation?",E,"The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.29, which is indicative of acidosis, a PaCO2 of 95 mm Hg, which is significantly elevated suggesting hypoventilation, a PaO2 of 70 mm Hg, which is low indicating hypoxemia, and a bicarbonate level of 24 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. The combination of these findings is most consistent with respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation.

Given the patient's history of polysubstance abuse and the context of the presentation (found unconscious outside a bar), we need to consider substances that can cause respiratory depression and hypoventilation. Among the options provided, heroin (option E) is a strong candidate because it is an opioid that can cause profound respiratory depression, which can lead to hypoventilation, acidosis, and hypoxemia.

Alcohol (option A) can also cause respiratory depression, but the degree of hypoventilation seen in this case is more severe than what is typically seen with alcohol alone. Cocaine (option C) is a stimulant and is less likely to cause hypoventilation. Ethylene glycol (option D) is a toxic alcohol that can cause metabolic acidosis, but it does not typically cause the degree of respiratory acidosis seen in this case. Amitriptyline (option B) is a tricyclic antidepressant that can cause anticholinergic effects, but it is less likely to cause significant hypoventilation.

Therefore, the most likely etiology of this patient's current presentation is heroin (option E).",Success

"A 6-month-old boy presents to his pediatrician for a wellness examination. The mother reports that her child has difficulty rolling from his back to his front and sitting unsupported. The patient is able to smile and furrow his brow normally, but she has noticed that he has a weak cry and suck. He was born at 38 weeks gestation via a spontaneous vaginal delivery without any complications. The mother said that the patient appeared ""normal"" until the past few weeks. On physical exam, his extraocular muscle movements are intact, and a symmetric smile is seen. He has symmetric flaccid weakness of both his upper and lower extremities. He also has a bell-shaped chest. Deep tendon reflexes are diminished. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"The patient's symptoms, which include symmetric flaccid weakness of both upper and lower extremities, a bell-shaped chest, diminished deep tendon reflexes, and a weak cry and suck, are most consistent with a neuromuscular disorder affecting the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. This condition is typically characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy, decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, and may involve respiratory muscles, which could explain the bell-shaped chest (a sign of respiratory muscle weakness). The fact that the patient was normal until a few weeks ago and is now showing signs of weakness suggests a rapidly progressive or acute onset condition.

Given the options provided:

A. Anterior horn cell degeneration - This is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Anterior horn cell degeneration can be seen in conditions such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), which is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy due to degeneration of the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord. The rapid onset and the patient's age suggest a type of SMA that presents in infancy.

B. Axonal demyelination - This refers to conditions like Guillain-Barré syndrome, which typically presents with ascending muscle weakness and areflexia. While it can present in infants, the progression is usually more rapid than what is described here, and the bell-shaped chest is not a typical feature.

C. Decreased acetylcholine receptor density - This is seen in myasthenia gravis, which is characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability. However, myasthenia gravis does not typically present with a bell-shaped chest or the degree of muscle weakness described.

D. Impaired acetylcholine release - This could refer to conditions like botulism or Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, which affect neuromuscular transmission. However, these conditions typically present with different symptoms and are less likely to cause the degree of muscle weakness and respiratory involvement described.

E. Myonecrosis - This refers to muscle cell death, which would typically present with localized muscle pain, swelling, and possibly myoglobinuria (dark urine). It does not typically present with the generalized muscle weakness and respiratory involvement described.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is **A. Anterior horn cell degeneration**, which could be due to a type of spinal muscular atrophy.",Success

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The most appropriate next step in management for this newborn with symptoms of irritability, restlessness, increased bowel movements, tachycardia, and a midline neck swelling in the context of maternal Graves' disease and propylthiouracil use during pregnancy is:

A. Methimazole and propranolol therapy

This newborn is likely experiencing symptoms of neonatal hyperthyroidism, which can be exacerbated by maternal thyroid-stimulating antibodies or thyroid hormone crossing the placenta. Methimazole is an antithyroid medication that can be used to manage hyperthyroidism in newborns, and propranolol can help control symptoms such as tachycardia.",Success

He has also had pain in the right ankle for 3 days and pain and swelling in the left knee for 1 day. Two weeks ago, he had several days of fever and bloody diarrhea, for which he was treated with antibiotics. Examination shows a small left knee effusion and bilateral conjunctival injection. Which of the following is the most likely additional finding in this patient?",D,"The most likely additional finding in this patient is D. Tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. The patient's symptoms and history suggest a diagnosis of reactive arthritis, which can be associated with inflammation of the tendons, particularly the Achilles tendon. This condition often follows an infection, such as the one the patient had two weeks ago, and can involve joint pain and swelling, conjunctivitis, and urethritis.",Success
"A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a painless lump on her neck for 3 months that has increased in size. She appears healthy. Examination shows a 2.5-cm (1-in) firm, irregular swelling on the left side of the neck that moves with swallowing. There is painless cervical lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound of the neck shows a solitary left lobe thyroid mass with increased vascularity and hyperechogenic punctate regions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy is scheduled for the following week. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The most likely diagnosis given the patient's history, examination findings, and ultrasound characteristics is D. Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. This type of cancer is the most common form of thyroid cancer and often presents as a painless lump in the neck. It is characterized by increased vascularity and may show hyperechogenic punctate regions on ultrasound, which can represent calcifications. Additionally, the presence of painless cervical lymphadenopathy suggests possible lymph node involvement, which is common in papillary thyroid cancer.",Success
"A 34-year-old man currently staying at an addiction center presents to the staff psychiatrist with diarrhea and painful muscle cramps. He has been discontinuing heroin over the last month as part of his treatment plan. He is HIV positive, hepatitis B (HBV) positive, and was recently treated for an infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. He reports pain over his abdomen, knees, and shoulder. To comprehensively treat these symptoms, which of the following would be the best therapy?",A,"The best therapy for this patient would be A. Methadone. Methadone is a long-acting opioid agonist that is used in the treatment of opioid addiction. It can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms such as diarrhea and muscle cramps by binding to the same receptors in the brain as heroin but without producing the same level of euphoria. This can help the patient manage his symptoms while he continues his treatment and recovery process at the addiction center.

Options B, C, D, and E are not as suitable for the comprehensive treatment of this patient's symptoms:

B. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used to reverse the effects of opioids in cases of overdose. It is not used to manage withdrawal symptoms.

C. Alvimopan is used to treat postoperative ileus (delayed recovery of normal bowel function after abdominal surgery) and is not indicated for the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms.

D. Morphine is an opioid agonist like heroin, but it is not used for long-term management of opioid addiction due to its high potential for abuse and dependence.

E. Loperamide is an anti-diarrheal medication that can help with the diarrhea, but it does not address the other symptoms such as muscle cramps and is not used to manage opioid withdrawal.",Success
"A 26-year-old man presents to his physician with a history of diarrhea and vomiting for the past 24 hours. On physical examination, his temperature is 36.9ºC (98.4ºF), pulse rate is 110/min, blood pressure is 102/74 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 16/min. A resident working under the physician plots a Darrow-Yannet diagram for the patient. The diagram is shown in the picture where the green dotted line represents the new fluid status. Which of the following is most likely to show increased secretion in this patient?",D,"The Darrow-Yannet diagram is used to assess fluid and electrolyte status in patients. In this case, the green dotted line represents the new fluid status of the patient, who has diarrhea and vomiting. The position of the line suggests that the patient is experiencing fluid loss, which is consistent with the symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting. 

The question asks which of the given options is most likely to show increased secretion in this patient. Among the options provided, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is the most relevant to the scenario described. VIP is a neurotransmitter and hormone that is produced in the gastrointestinal tract and has several functions, including increasing the secretion of water and electrolytes in the intestines. In the context of diarrhea, VIP levels may be elevated as part of the body's response to the gastrointestinal disturbance.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

E. Vasoactive intestinal peptide",Success
"A 28-year-old female comes to the physician’s office with a complaint of episodic chest pain. She describes the pain as squeezing and tightness in her chest. This pain has been happening every few days for 3 months. She says there is no association of the pain with food or exercise. She is able to climb up to her fourth floor apartment daily without issue. Her only past medical history is migraines for which she takes appropriate medication. Here temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. She has no known family history. The patient is not in pain on presentation and EKG in the office is normal. 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely. The mechanism of this patient’s chest pain is most similar to the mechanism behind which of the following?",A,"The mechanism of this patient's chest pain is most similar to the mechanism behind Option A: Raynaud's phenomenon. However, it is important to clarify that Raynaud's phenomenon typically affects the extremities (fingers and toes) due to vasospasm in response to cold or stress, causing color changes and sometimes pain. The chest pain in this case is more likely related to a variant form of angina pectoris called Prinzmetal's angina, which is characterized by transient ST elevations on ECG during episodes of pain. This type of angina is caused by vasospasm of the coronary arteries, leading to transient ischemia of the heart muscle. This scenario does not fit well with the other options provided, as they do not involve the mechanism of vasospasm leading to ischemia.",Success
"A 22-year-old gravida 1 presents to her physician at 15 weeks gestation for a prenatal appointment. She complains of a rash involving her chest, face, and arms, a watery nasal discharge, and mild bilateral knee pain. She has had these symptoms for about 5 days. The symptoms do not seem to bother her too much, but she is concerned for the baby. She had contact with her younger sister, who also had a rash and was diagnosed with rubella infection about 10 days ago at a family gathering. She cannot confirm her vaccination history. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 89/min; respiratory rate, 12/min; and temperature, 37.6℃ (99.7℉). Examination shows a moderately dense maculopapular lacy rash spread over the patient’s trunk, extremities, and face. No lymph node, liver, or spleen enlargement is noted. The knee joints appear normal.
Serology performed 1 year ago Current serology
Rubella IgM - negative Rubella IgM - negative
Rubella IgG - 1:128 Rubella IgG - 1:64
Rubella IgG avidity - high Rubella IgG avidity - high
What is the proper next step in the management of this woman?",D,"Given the patient's history of contact with a confirmed rubella case, her symptoms, and the serologic results, the most appropriate next step in management would be to test for rubella virus PCR (Option E). This test will help confirm an active rubella infection, which is crucial given the potential teratogenic effects of rubella on the fetus, especially in the first trimester and early second trimester.

The patient's previous serology shows that she has a high avidity IgG antibody, which indicates a past infection or vaccination. However, the drop in IgG titer from 1:128 to 1:64 and the presence of symptoms suggest a possible recent reactivation or reinfection. The negative IgM result does not rule out an active infection, as IgM may not be detectable in all cases of recent infection, especially in individuals with pre-existing immunity.

Rubella infection during pregnancy can lead to congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in the fetus, which can cause serious birth defects. Therefore, confirming the diagnosis is critical to assess the risk to the fetus and provide appropriate counseling and management.

Options A, B, and C are not the immediate next steps. Option A is not appropriate because the patient's vaccination status is unknown, and she may currently have an active infection. Option B is not indicated without confirming the diagnosis and assessing the risk to the fetus. Option C, chorionic villus sampling, is an invasive procedure that carries its own risks and is not the first-line approach for diagnosing rubella infection in pregnancy.

Option D, testing for parvovirus B19, is not the most appropriate next step because the patient's symptoms and exposure history are more consistent with rubella. However, it could be considered if rubella PCR results are negative and the clinical suspicion for parvovirus B19 is high based on symptoms or additional clinical findings.",Success

"A 47-year-old female undergoes a thyroidectomy for treatment of Graves' disease. Post-operatively, she reports a hoarse voice and difficulty speaking. You suspect that this is likely a complication of her recent surgery. What is the embryologic origin of the damaged nerve that is most likely causing this patient's hoarseness?",E,"The nerve that is most likely causing the patient's hoarseness and difficulty speaking is the recurrent laryngeal nerve. This nerve is responsible for innervating the majority of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, which are crucial for phonation and voice production. Damage to this nerve can result in hoarseness or loss of voice, a condition known as dysphonia.

The recurrent laryngeal nerve originates from the vagus nerve (CN X), which develops from the 4th pharyngeal arch (Option D). Therefore, the correct answer is D. 4th pharyngeal arch.",Success

Physical examination demonstrates wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields. The child is started on supplemental oxygen and a nebulized bronchodilator. Which of the following is a downstream effect of this medication?",E,"The downstream effect of the nebulized bronchodilator that is most likely to occur in this scenario is E. Increased adenylate cyclase activity. Nebulized bronchodilators, such as beta-agonists, work by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors on the smooth muscle cells of the bronchi. This stimulation leads to an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP), which is produced by adenylate cyclase. The increased cAMP then activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates myosin light-chain kinase, leading to bronchodilation. This mechanism helps to relieve the severe shortness of breath experienced by the patient with asthma.",Success

B. Chest radiography

The patient's symptoms of fever, cough, localized crackles, and decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung field suggest a possible pneumonia. A chest radiograph can help confirm the presence of pneumonia and guide antibiotic therapy. While other tests such as blood cultures, sputum culture, and urine antigen tests may also be useful in identifying the causative organism, chest radiography is the most immediate and direct way to assess the lung pathology in this case.

C. Herpes simplex keratitis

The patient's symptoms of progressive pain, blurry vision, and difficulty opening the eye, combined with the fact that he wears contact lenses, point towards a corneal infection. Herpes simplex keratitis is a common cause of corneal infections, especially in contact lens wearers. The unilateral presentation and the absence of symptoms in the other eye also support this diagnosis. However, without the visual examination or the photograph, it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis. Other options like Pseudomonas keratitis could also be considered given the patient's contact lens use, but the typical presentation of Herpes simplex keratitis aligns more closely with the symptoms described.",Success

"A 22-year-old man with sickle cell disease is brought to the emergency room for acute onset facial asymmetry and severe pain. He was in school when his teacher noted a drooping of his left face. His temperature is 99.9°F (37.7°C), blood pressure is 122/89 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for facial asymmetry and 4/5 strength in the patient's upper and lower extremity. A CT scan of the head does not demonstrate an intracranial bleed. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",B,"The patient's presentation is consistent with a stroke, which is a known complication of sickle cell disease. The facial asymmetry and motor weakness in the extremities are classic signs of a stroke. Since the CT scan of the head does not demonstrate an intracranial bleed, the patient is not at immediate risk of hemorrhage, which rules out options that might exacerbate bleeding, such as Alteplase (A), Heparin (C), and Warfarin (E).

In the context of sickle cell disease, an exchange transfusion (B) can be used to treat a stroke by rapidly lowering the proportion of sickle hemoglobin in the blood, thereby reducing the risk of further vaso-occlusive events. This is the most appropriate treatment for this patient, given his acute presentation and the need for urgent intervention to prevent further neurological damage.

Hydroxyurea (D) is a medication that can help reduce the frequency of painful crises and the need for blood transfusions in patients with sickle cell disease by increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin. However, it is not an immediate treatment for an acute stroke.

Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",D,"The presence of white plaques on the tongue and palate, along with the systemic symptoms and signs of infection, suggest a possible diagnosis of oral thrush, which is often associated with a weakened immune system in infants. The most likely test to confirm a diagnosis related to the symptoms and signs described would be:

E. T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC) analysis

TREC analysis is used to diagnose severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which can present with recurrent infections, failure to thrive, and oral thrush in infants. This test measures the number of TREC in the blood, which reflects the number of newly generated T cells. A low TREC count can indicate a problem with T cell production, which is a hallmark of SCID and other primary immunodeficiencies.

The other options are less likely to confirm the diagnosis based on the symptoms presented:

A. Karyotyping of infant's chromosomes would be used to diagnose chromosomal abnormalities, which do not appear to be relevant to the symptoms described.

B. DNA test for CFTR mutation would be used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, which typically presents with symptoms such as chronic lung disease and malabsorption, but does not typically present with the specific symptoms described in the question.

C. Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test would be used to diagnose syphilis, which can present with lymphadenopathy, but the other symptoms do not specifically point to syphilis.

An ELISA for HIV is negative. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""",E,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with acute viral hepatitis. The high levels of liver enzymes (AST and ALT), jaundice, and the recent travel history to Sudan suggest a possible viral etiology. Among the options given, Anti-HEV IgM (Option E) is the most likely to confirm the diagnosis of acute viral hepatitis in this case.

HEV (Hepatitis E Virus) is common in developing countries and can be contracted through contaminated food or water. Sudan, being a developing country, has a higher prevalence of HEV. The presence of Anti-HEV IgM antibodies indicates a recent infection with HEV, as IgM antibodies are typically the first to appear in response to a new infection.

The other options are less likely to confirm the diagnosis in this scenario:
A. HBsAg (Hepatitis B Surface Antigen) would indicate a current or chronic Hepatitis B infection, which is less likely given the acute presentation.
B. Anti-HAV IgG (Hepatitis A Virus IgG) would indicate a past infection with Hepatitis A, not an acute one, as IgG antibodies appear later in the infection and persist long after recovery.
C. HCV RNA (Hepatitis C Virus RNA) would confirm an active Hepatitis C infection, but this is less likely given the acute presentation and lack of risk factors such as blood product exposure.
D. Anti-HCV IgG (Hepatitis C Virus IgG) would indicate a past or current Hepatitis C infection but would not necessarily confirm an acute infection.",Success

Which of the following is the best explanation of this patient's current presentation?",B,"The patient's presentation is most consistent with heart failure, given his symptoms of shortness of breath and cough that came on suddenly while sleeping, along with physical exam findings of bipedal edema and jugular venous distention (JVD). The lab values do not suggest a classic presentation of any of the renal tubular acidosis (RTA) types listed. However, the question seems to ask for the explanation of the presentation rather than a diagnosis.

Given the context, the best explanation for the patient's presentation is not directly related to the options provided (A through E). However, if we are to choose the option that might be relevant to his presentation, it would be:

A. Furosemide

This is because furosemide is a loop diuretic commonly used in the treatment of heart failure to reduce fluid overload. The patient's symptoms improved rapidly with medical therapy, which likely included furosemide, given the context of his presentation.

It's important to note that the patient's hypokalemia (low potassium level) could be related to diuretic therapy, particularly if he has been taking furosemide or another diuretic like hydrochlorothiazide (option B) chronically. However, the question does not provide information on whether the patient is taking furosemide, and his medication list does not include it. The other options (C through E) refer to different types of renal tubular acidosis, which do not seem to be the primary explanation for his current presentation based on the information provided.",Success
"A 23-year-old woman is seen by her primary care physician for fatigue. She says that she has always felt a little short of breath compared to her friends; however, she did not think that it was abnormal until she started trying a new exercise regimen. On physical exam, she is found to have mild conjunctival pallor and a peripheral blood smear is obtained showing echinocytes but no intracellular accumulations. Upon further questioning, she recalls that several relatives have had similar issues with fatigue and pallor in the past. Which of the following is true about the rate limiting enzyme of the biochemical pathway that is affected by this patient's most likely condition?",C,"The patient's symptoms and the presence of echinocytes (spur cells) on her peripheral blood smear, along with the history of similar issues in her relatives, suggest a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. However, the description of her condition and the options provided do not directly relate to hereditary spherocytosis but rather to the regulation of glycolysis, the metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose for energy.

The rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which catalyzes the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. This step is crucial because it commits glucose to the glycolytic pathway and is regulated by several factors.

Option A: PFK is not directly stimulated by ATP. In fact, ATP acts as an allosteric inhibitor of PFK at high concentrations, as it signals an abundance of energy.

Option B: Citrate does not directly stimulate PFK. Citrate is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle and can inhibit phosphofructokinase indirectly by increasing the concentration of ATP.

Option C: PFK is inhibited by protein kinase A activity. Protein kinase A (PKA) can phosphorylate and inactivate PFK, reducing its activity. This is part of the hormonal regulation of glycolysis, where hormones like glucagon and epinephrine can activate PKA, leading to the inhibition of PFK and a decrease in glycolysis.

Option D: Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate is a potent activator of PFK, not an inhibitor. This compound is produced by the enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2) and is a key regulator of glycolysis.

Option E: AMP is an activator of PFK. When energy levels are low, the AMP/ATP ratio increases, and AMP binds to PFK, stimulating its activity to increase glycolysis and energy production.

Given the options, the correct answer is:

C. It is inhibited by protein kinase A activity.",Success
"A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because she feels depressed, has difficulty sleeping, a poor appetite, and low concentration for the past 3 months. During this time, she has also had low energy and lost interest in playing the guitar. During high school, the patient went through similar episodes of low mood and poor sleep. At that time, she would repeatedly engage in binge eating and purging behavior, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. The physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should most be avoided in this patient?",C,"The patient's history of binge eating and purging behavior during high school, which is indicative of an eating disorder, is a critical piece of information in this question. Among the options given, Bupropion (Option C) should most be avoided in this patient due to its potential to exacerbate eating disorders. Bupropion can potentially increase the risk of seizures, and it has been associated with the induction or worsening of bulimia and other eating disorders. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Bupropion.",Success
"A 5-month-old boy is brought to the physician with a 3-day history of fever and cough. His mother reports that he has had multiple episodes of loose stools over the past 3 months. He has been treated for otitis media 4 times and bronchiolitis 3 times since birth. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation, and the neonatal period was uncomplicated. He is at the 10th percentile for height and 3rd percentile for weight. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 126/min, and respirations are 35/min. Examination shows an erythematous scaly rash over his trunk and extremities. The white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa bleed when scraped. Inspiratory crackles are heard in the right lung base. An X-ray of the chest shows an infiltrate in the right lower lobe and an absent thymic shadow. Which of the following is the most likely definitive treatment for this patient’s condition?",A,"The patient's history of recurrent infections, failure to thrive, and the physical examination findings, including the rash, oral candidiasis (indicated by the white patches that bleed when scraped), and the absent thymic shadow on chest X-ray, suggest a primary immunodeficiency. The absence of a thymic shadow is particularly concerning as it is often associated with DiGeorge syndrome (also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome) or other thymic aplasia/hypoplasia conditions.

DiGeorge syndrome is a complex condition that can involve multiple systems, including the immune system, heart, and parathyroid glands. It is characterized by a failure of the thymus to develop properly, leading to a deficiency in T-lymphocytes, which are crucial for the immune response. This can result in recurrent infections, as seen in this patient.

Given the severity of the immunodeficiency and the potential involvement of other systems, the most likely definitive treatment for this patient's condition would be hematopoietic cell transplantation (Option A). Hematopoietic cell transplantation can potentially correct the underlying immunodeficiency by replacing the patient's hematopoietic stem cells with healthy ones, allowing for the development of a functional immune system.

Options B through E are not definitive treatments for the underlying condition:

B. Interferon-γ therapy is used for conditions like chronic granulomatous disease, but it does not address the underlying T-cell deficiency.

C. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) can provide temporary passive immunity but does not correct the underlying T-cell deficiency.

D. Leucovorin supplementation is used in conditions like megaloblastic anemia or to counteract the effects of methotrexate; it is not a treatment for immunodeficiency.

E. Thymic transplantation is an experimental treatment for DiGeorge syndrome and may be considered in select cases, but hematopoietic cell transplantation is currently the more established definitive treatment for severe immunodeficiencies.",Success

Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?""",E,"The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms is B. Phagocytosis of autoantibody-opsonized platelets. This scenario is indicative of a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which is a complication that can occur in patients receiving heparin therapy. The drop in platelet count, the presence of new thrombotic events (hematomas, leg pain, and swelling), and the timing of symptoms (5-10 days after starting heparin) are all consistent with HIT. In HIT, antibodies form against a complex of heparin and platelet factor 4 (PF4), leading to platelet activation and aggregation, which can result in thrombocytopenia and paradoxically, thrombosis. The presence of hematomas and leg pain in this patient suggest that she may have developed HIT and possibly a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her right leg.",Success
A 55-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B virus infection comes to the physician because of generalized fatigue and a 5.4 kg (12 lb) weight loss over the past 4 months. Physical examination shows hepatomegaly. Laboratory studies show an α-fetoprotein concentration of 380 ng/ml (N < 10 ng/mL). A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast shows a solitary mass in the left lobe of the liver that enhances in the arterial phase. Which of the following is the most likely underlying pathogenesis of this patient's current condition?,E,"The most likely underlying pathogenesis of this patient's current condition is E. Integration of foreign DNA into host genome. The patient's history of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, along with the presence of a solitary mass in the liver, hepatomegaly, and an elevated α-fetoprotein level, suggests the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

"A 28-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presents to her primary care physician with increased menstrual bleeding over the past three months. She also notes easy bruising and bleeding from her gums when brushing her teeth. She is sexually active with multiple partners and has no history of intravenous drug use. Physical exam is remarkable for petechiae and scattered ecchymoses on the patient's bilateral upper and lower extremities. Urine beta-HCG is negative. Laboratory results are as follows: Hgb 13.0 g/dL, WBCs 6,000/mL, platelets 95,000/mL, PT 13.2s, aPTT 30s. Peripheral blood smear shows normocytic, normochromic red blood cells and few platelets with no morphologic abnormalities. Which diagnostic study should be performed next?",D,"Given the patient's symptoms of increased menstrual bleeding, easy bruising, bleeding gums, and the physical exam findings of petechiae and ecchymoses, along with the laboratory results showing a platelet count of 95,000/mL (which is slightly low but not severely so), the next diagnostic study should focus on evaluating for causes of bleeding disorders and potential platelet dysfunction. 

Options B (Vitamin B12 and folate levels) and D (HIV and HCV testing) are relevant for general health and could be considered as part of a broader workup, but they do not directly address the bleeding symptoms or the platelet count.

Option E (Bone marrow aspiration) could be considered if there were significant abnormalities in the blood smear or if the patient had symptoms or signs suggestive of bone marrow failure or malignancy, but the blood smear is described as showing normocytic, normochromic red blood cells and no morphologic abnormalities in the platelets, which lessens the immediate need for this invasive procedure.

Option C (Measurement of ADAMTS13 activity) is relevant for the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), but the platelet count is not low enough to strongly suggest this diagnosis, and there are no other typical symptoms of TTP mentioned, such as fever, neurologic symptoms, or renal failure.

Option A (Serum factor VIII levels and von Willebrand factor activity) is the most appropriate next step in this scenario. Von Willebrand disease (vWD) is a common inherited bleeding disorder that can present with symptoms similar to those described by the patient, including menorrhagia, easy bruising, and bleeding gums. The laboratory findings are also consistent with vWD, as the platelet count is not severely reduced, and there are no abnormalities in the PT or aPTT that would suggest other coagulation disorders. Therefore, measuring factor VIII levels and von Willebrand factor activity is the best initial approach to further evaluate the cause of her bleeding symptoms.",Success
"A 6-year-old boy is brought in by his parents to a pediatrician’s office for persistent fever. His temperature has ranged from 38.6°C–39.5°C (101.5°F–103.1°F) over the past week. He was diagnosed with a gene defect on chromosome 7, which has caused dysfunction in a transmembrane protein. This defect has resulted in several hospitalizations for various respiratory infections. At the present time, he is struggling with a cough with thick purulent sputum. A sputum sample is sent for culture and the patient is started on vancomycin.The pediatrician tells the patient’s family that there is a collection of mucus in the respiratory tree which increases the patient's chances of future infections. He will have to undergo chest physiotherapy and they should report any signs of infection immediately to a medical professional. Which of the following pathogens will most likely infect this patient in adulthood?",B,"The patient's history and symptoms, along with the mention of a gene defect causing dysfunction in a transmembrane protein and resulting in respiratory infections, suggest a diagnosis consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene, which is located on chromosome 7. This genetic defect leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus that can clog the lungs and lead to recurrent respiratory infections.

Given the patient's history and the fact that he is already being treated with vancomycin, which is an antibiotic used to treat serious bacterial infections, the most likely pathogen to infect this patient in adulthood is **B. Pseudomonas**.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis and is known to cause chronic lung infections in these patients. It is a Gram-negative bacterium that can thrive in the thick mucus found in the lungs of CF patients, leading to persistent and recurrent infections. Pseudomonas infections in CF patients can be particularly difficult to treat and can contribute significantly to the decline in lung function over time.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

B. Pseudomonas",Success
"An 8-week-old male presents with his mother to the pediatrician for a well visit. The patient has been breastfed since birth, and usually feeds for 30 minutes every 2-3 hours. The patient’s mother is concerned that her milk production is not keeping up with the patient’s nutritional requirements. She reports that about two weeks ago the patient began regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds. She reports that he seems mildly upset during the episodes of regurgitation but usually settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. The patient’s mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of the regurgitation. She denies any diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. Her older son had a similar problem with vomiting that resolved around 12 months of age. Four weeks ago, the patient’s height and weight were in the 40th and 34th percentiles, respectively. His height and weight are now respectively in the 37th and 36th percentiles. On physical exam, the patient is cooing in his mother’s lap and smiles reciprocally with her. He lifts his head and shoulders off the examination table when placed in the supine position. His abdomen is soft, non-tender and non-distended. Bowel sounds are normoactive.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",C,"The patient's history and physical exam findings are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux (GER), a common condition in infants. The fact that the patient is growing appropriately and that the regurgitation is not associated with other concerning symptoms (such as diarrhea, hematochezia, or failure to thrive) suggests that this is likely a benign condition that can be managed conservatively. The patient's improvement with smaller feed volumes also supports this diagnosis.

Given the benign nature of the condition and the patient's overall good health and growth, the best next step in management is likely reassurance and counseling on positioning (Option C). This includes keeping the infant upright for 20-30 minutes after feeding and elevating the head of the bed during sleep, which can help reduce reflux episodes. There is no indication for aggressive medical therapy such as a proton pump inhibitor (Option A) at this time, as the symptoms are not severe and the patient is growing appropriately. An abdominal ultrasound (Option B) is not necessary unless there are concerning symptoms or signs of a more serious underlying condition, which is not the case here. Modifying the mother's diet (Option D) or switching to a hydrolyzed formula (Option E) may be considered if there is a suspicion of a food allergy or intolerance, but this is not indicated based on the information provided.

What changes should be made to his current asthma treatment regimen?",C,"Based on the information provided, the six-year-old boy's asthma symptoms have worsened, as indicated by increased use of his albuterol inhaler, nighttime awakenings due to asthma, and difficulty keeping up with his friends during play. These signs suggest that his asthma is not well-controlled under his current treatment regimen. The presence of bilateral late expiratory wheezes on auscultation further supports this assessment.

The goal of asthma management is to achieve and maintain control of the disease, minimize symptoms, and maintain normal activity levels. When asthma control is inadequate, as in this case, the treatment plan should be stepped up according to the guidelines of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP).

Option C: Add fluticasone daily is the most appropriate choice. Fluticasone is an inhaled corticosteroid that reduces airway inflammation, which is a key component of asthma. Daily use of an inhaled corticosteroid is recommended for persistent asthma to achieve better control. This would be a step up from his current as-needed albuterol use, which is a short-acting beta agonist used for quick relief of symptoms.

Options B, D, and E are not the first-line choices for stepping up treatment in a patient with worsening asthma control. Cromolyn (option B) is a mast cell stabilizer and is not typically used as a primary controller medication.

These results are consistent with a respiratory acidosis, which is typically caused by hypoventilation leading to a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood.

Option E, Chronic Obstructive Bronchitis (COPD), is the most likely cause of these ABG results. COPD can lead to hypoventilation due to airway obstruction, causing increased pCO2 levels and potentially leading to respiratory acidosis. The compensatory mechanism for this type of acidosis is an increase in bicarbonate (HCO3) levels, which is also seen in the patient's ABG results.

Here is a brief explanation of why the other options are less likely:

A. Panic attack: While a panic attack can cause changes in breathing, it typically leads to hyperventilation, which would result in a respiratory alkalosis (low pCO2) rather than the respiratory acidosis seen in this patient.

B. Mechanical ventilation: If set improperly, mechanical ventilation could potentially lead to hypoventilation and respiratory acidosis. However, since the patient is presenting from home, it is less likely that he is on mechanical ventilation.

C. Diabetic ketoacidosis: This condition causes metabolic acidosis, which would be reflected in a low pH and low bicarbonate level, not the respiratory acidosis seen in the patient's ABG results.

D. Pulmonary embolus: This condition can cause respiratory distress and hypoxemia, but it does not typically lead to the significant increase in pCO2 and the compensatory increase in bicarbonate that is seen in this patient's ABG results.

Therefore, the most likely answer is E. Chronic obstructive bronchitis.",Success
"A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with fever, chest discomfort, tachypnea, pain, needle-like sensations in the upper extremities, and profuse sweating. He also complains of a gradual decrease in vision over the past 3 months. He is a bodybuilding competitor and has a competition coming up in 1 week. The man reports that his symptoms appeared suddenly, 30 minutes after he took 2 foreign-manufactured fat-burning pills instead of the 1 he usually takes. His blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, heart rate is 137/min, respiratory rate is 26/min, and temperature is 39.9°C (103.8°F). Physical examination reveals a reddish maculopapular rash over the patient’s trunk, diminished lung and heart sounds, tenderness to palpation in his abdomen, and rotational bilateral nystagmus with an alternating gaze-dependent fast component. Ophthalmologic examination shows bilateral cataracts. The patient’s total blood count is as follows:
Erythrocytes 4.4 x 109/mm3
Hb 12 g/dL
Total leukocyte count  3750/mm3
Neutrophils 57%
Lymphocyte 37%
Eosinophil 1%
Monocyte 5%
Basophil 0%
Platelet count 209,000/mm3
Which of the following statements best describes the pathogenesis of this patient’s condition?",B,"The patient’s symptoms are most consistent with a drug-induced hypermetabolic state, which is likely caused by the consumption of the foreign-manufactured fat-burning pills. The pathogenesis of this condition is best described by option B: The drug caused uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. This type of drug can lead to an increase in metabolic rate, causing symptoms such as fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia. The uncoupling of the electron transport chain can lead to increased heat production and hyperthermia, which is consistent with the patient's high fever. The other symptoms, such as the rash, decreased vision, and nystagmus, may be secondary to the drug's effects on various organ systems. The decreased total leukocyte count and the presence of cataracts may also be related to the drug's toxicity. Therefore, option B is the most likely explanation for the patient's condition. However, it is important to note that the specific drug involved and its mechanism of action would need to be confirmed through further investigation and analysis.",Success
"A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive fatigue and painful swelling of her right knee for 3 weeks. She works as a professional ballet dancer and says, “I'm always trying to be in shape for my upcoming performances.” She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 45 kg (99 lb); BMI is 17 kg/m2. Physical examination shows tenderness and limited range of motion in her right knee. Oral examination shows bleeding and swelling of the gums. There are diffuse petechiae around hair follicles on her abdomen and both thighs. Laboratory studies show a prothrombin time of 12 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 35 seconds, and a bleeding time of 11 minutes. Arthrocentesis of the right knee shows bloody synovial fluid. The patient’s condition is most likely associated with a defect in a reaction that occurs in which of the following cellular structures?",B,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a bleeding disorder, specifically a deficiency in one of the coagulation factors. The prolonged bleeding time and the presence of petechiae, along with the bloody synovial fluid from the arthrocentesis, point towards a problem with platelet function or coagulation factors. The prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) being prolonged also indicate a coagulation disorder.

The coagulation factors are synthesized in the liver, and their synthesis is associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), where they undergo post-translational modifications such as glycosylation and the addition of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues, which are essential for their function.

Therefore, the defect in the reaction that leads to this patient's condition is most likely associated with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The correct answer is:

B. Rough endoplasmic reticulum",Success
A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician because she had unprotected intercourse with her boyfriend the previous day. She has had regular menses since menarche at the age of 12. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago. She has no history of serious illness but is allergic to certain jewelry and metal alloys. She takes no medications. A urine pregnancy test is negative. She does not wish to become pregnant until she finishes college in six months. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,C,"The most appropriate next step in management for this patient is to administer ulipristal acetate (Option C). Ulipristal acetate is an emergency contraceptive pill that can be taken up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse to prevent pregnancy. It is specifically designed for situations like this where a patient has had unprotected sex and wishes to avoid pregnancy.

After using ulipristal acetate, the patient should be advised on long-term contraceptive options. Since she wishes to avoid pregnancy for the next six months, an option such as a copper-containing intra-uterine device (IUD) (Option A) could be considered. Copper IUDs can also be used as emergency contraception if inserted within 5 days of unprotected intercourse and can provide effective long-term contraception for several years.

However, for the immediate need to prevent pregnancy following unprotected sex, ulipristal acetate is the most appropriate choice among the options given.",Success

"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 6-month history of mild episodic abdominal pain. The episodes occur every 1–2 months and last for a few hours. The pain is located in the epigastrium, radiates to his back, and is occasionally associated with mild nausea. His mother is concerned that his condition might be hereditary because his older sister was diagnosed with congenital heart disease. He is otherwise healthy and has met all developmental milestones. He is at the 75th percentile for height and the 65th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows no abdominal distention, guarding, or rebound tenderness. Which of the following congenital conditions would best explain this patient's symptoms?",E,"The symptoms described in the case of the 6-year-old boy with episodic abdominal pain, located in the epigastrium and radiating to his back, occasionally associated with mild nausea, do not specifically point to any of the congenital conditions listed as options. However, among the options provided, Pancreas divisum (Option E) could potentially explain his symptoms, as it is a congenital anomaly that can cause recurrent abdominal pain, although it is not typically associated with a hereditary pattern like the mother's concern about a hereditary condition might suggest.

Pancreas divisum is a condition where the two parts of the pancreas (the dorsal and ventral buds) do not fuse properly during embryonic development, resulting in separate ductal systems. This can lead to incomplete drainage of the pancreatic ducts, causing recurrent abdominal pain, pancreatitis, and other related symptoms. The pain can be epigastric and may radiate to the back, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms.

The other options are less likely to explain the symptoms:

A. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis typically presents in the first few weeks of life with projectile vomiting and failure to thrive, not episodic abdominal pain in a 6-year-old.

B. Biliary cysts can cause abdominal pain, but they are not typically associated with hereditary patterns and would not necessarily explain the episodic nature of the pain.

C. Tracheoesophageal fistula usually presents in the neonatal period with respiratory distress and feeding difficulties, not episodic abdominal pain in a 6-year-old.

D. Intestinal malrotation can cause abdominal pain and other symptoms, but it is often associated with more severe symptoms such as volvulus, which would likely present with more acute and severe symptoms than described.

Given the options, Pancreas divisum (Option E) is the most plausible diagnosis based on the symptoms described, although further diagnostic workup would be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.",Success
"A healthy, full-term 1-day-old female is being evaluated after birth and is noted to have a cleft palate and a systolic ejection murmur at the second left intercostal space. A chest radiograph is obtained which reveals a boot-shaped heart and absence of a thymus. An echocardiogram is done which shows pulmonary stenosis with a hypertrophic right ventricular wall, ventricular septal defect, and overriding of the aorta. Which of the following additional features is expected to be seen in this patient?",A,"The patient described in the question has features consistent with DiGeorge syndrome (also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome), which is characterized by a combination of congenital defects including cardiac anomalies, thymic aplasia, and parathyroid dysfunction. The clinical presentation includes:

- Cleft palate
- Cardiac defects (pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta)
- Absence of the thymus (thymic aplasia)

Given these features, the additional feature expected to be seen in this patient is:

A. Seizures due to hypocalcemia

This is because DiGeorge syndrome often involves hypoparathyroidism, which can lead to hypocalcemia. The parathyroid glands are responsible for regulating calcium levels in the blood, and their absence or dysfunction can result in low calcium levels. Hypocalcemia can cause symptoms such as seizures, muscle cramps, and tetany. The other options listed (catlike cry, hyperthyroidism from transplacental antibodies, webbing of the neck, and increased phenylalanine in the blood) are not typically associated with DiGeorge syndrome.",Success

Results of a lipid panel are: Total cholesterol is 280 mg/dl, triglycerides are 110 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol is 40 mg/dl, and LDL cholesterol is 195 mg/dl. Her physician considers starting her on atorvastatin. Which of the following will most likely decrease after initiating this medication?",A,"The correct answer is D. LDL cholesterol. Atorvastatin is a medication that belongs to the class of statins, which are used to lower cholesterol levels. Statins work by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is involved in the production of cholesterol in the liver. By inhibiting this enzyme, statins reduce the production of LDL cholesterol, which is often referred to as ""bad"" cholesterol because high levels are associated with an increased risk of heart disease and stroke. Atorvastatin will not decrease mevalonate, acetoacetyl-CoA, or diacylglycerol, and it may actually increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is often referred to as ""good"" cholesterol.",Success

Which of the following receptors are targeted by the pathogen most likely responsible for this patient’s condition?",C,"The image is not provided in the text, but based on the clinical presentation and the patient's exposure to bats, the most likely diagnosis is rabies. Rabies is caused by the rabies virus, which is a neurotropic virus that targets the central nervous system. The rabies virus primarily targets neurons and can bind to several receptors, including the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, the acetylcholine receptor.

A 44-year-old woman with hypothyroidism comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of tingling in her feet and poor balance. Her only medication is levothyroxine. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor and an ataxic gait. Proprioception and sense of vibration are decreased in her toes bilaterally. Laboratory studies show macrocytic anemia and normal thyroid hormone levels. Histological evaluation of tissue samples obtained by esophagogastroduodenoscopy reveals atrophic changes of the gastric body and fundus with normal antral mucosa. Which of the following structures is most likely being targeted by antibodies in this patient?,C,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of pernicious anemia, which is characterized by macrocytic anemia, atrophic gastritis, and vitamin B12 deficiency. The presence of ataxia, decreased proprioception, and sense of vibration in the toes are consistent with subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, a neurological complication of vitamin B12 deficiency. The histological evaluation showing atrophic changes in the gastric body and fundus with normal antral mucosa is also consistent with pernicious anemia.

In pernicious anemia, the autoimmune destruction of parietal cells in the gastric mucosa leads to a deficiency of intrinsic factor, a protein necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum. Without intrinsic factor, vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed, leading to megaloblastic anemia and neurological symptoms.

Therefore, the structure most likely being targeted by antibodies in this patient is:

C. Parietal cells",Success
"A 26-year-old female complains of frequent, large volume urination. This negatively affects her sleep, as she has to frequently wake up at night to urinate. She also complains of increased thirst.

Which of the following best explains this patient’s serum and urine osmolality?",C,"The patient's symptoms of frequent, large volume urination, increased thirst, and the laboratory findings of high serum osmolality (425 mOsm/kg) and low urine osmolality (176 mOsm/kg) are indicative of a condition known as nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. This condition is characterized by the kidneys' inability to respond to antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to an inability to concentrate urine. 

Given that the patient has been treated with lithium for 3 years and lithium is a known cause of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the most likely explanation for her symptoms and laboratory findings is:

C. ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts

Lithium can interfere with the action of ADH on the collecting ducts of the kidney, leading to a resistance to the hormone's effects and thus an inability to concentrate urine effectively. This results in the production of large volumes of dilute urine, which can lead to dehydration and increased thirst.",Success

Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The patient's serum sodium level is 154 mEq/L, which indicates hypernatremia. Hypernatremia can be caused by excessive water loss or excessive sodium intake. In this case, the patient has a significant output from surgical drains, which is likely causing a significant water loss. The patient's clinical presentation, including being difficult to arouse and having dry skin and mucous membranes, also suggests dehydration.

The best initial treatment for hypernatremia due to dehydration is to replace the free water loss. However, since the patient is in the ICU and may have limited oral intake, oral free water replacement (Option E) is not the best choice. Instead, intravenous fluids should be used to correct the dehydration and hypernatremia.

Option A (0.45% saline IV) and Option B (0.9% saline IV) are both isotonic saline solutions that contain sodium. Using these solutions would not correct the hypernatremia and could potentially worsen it. Option C (5% dextrose IV) is a hypotonic solution that can be used to correct hypernatremia by providing free water. Option D (5% dextrose IV with 0.45% saline IV) also contains free water but also includes some sodium, which may not be ideal in this case of significant hypernatremia.

Given the patient's hypernatremia and dehydration, the best initial treatment would be to provide free water replacement with a hypotonic solution to correct the sodium imbalance. Therefore, the best next step in management would be Option C, 5% dextrose IV. However, it is important to monitor the patient's serum sodium levels closely and adjust the rate of fluid administration to avoid overcorrection, which can lead to cerebral edema.",Success

Which of the following is the most likely pathogen?",E,"The most likely pathogen in this case is E. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). This is because ETEC is a common cause of traveler's diarrhea, especially in individuals returning from areas with poor sanitation such as some parts of India. The symptoms described, including watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and the onset after eating, are consistent with ETEC infection. The lack of fever and relatively normal vital signs also support this diagnosis, as ETEC infections are often not associated with high fever. Other options like Giardia intestinalis and Shigella species can also cause diarrhea, but they are less likely in this scenario given the patient's recent travel and the nature of her symptoms. Staphylococcus aureus can cause food poisoning with rapid onset of symptoms, but the symptoms are usually more severe and include vomiting, which is not prominent in this case.

"A research group has created a novel screening test for a rare disorder. A robust clinical trial is performed in a group of 100 subjects comparing the new screening test against the gold standard. The results are given in the table below:
Screening test\gold standard Disease present Disease absent
Positive 45 15
Negative 5 35
Which of the following is most correct regarding the statistical power of this new screening test?",E,"To determine which option is most correct regarding the statistical power of the new screening test, let's first define statistical power and analyze the given data.

Statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. In the context of a screening test, it is the probability of correctly identifying those with the disease (true positive rate, which is also the sensitivity of the test).

Given data:
- True positives (TP): 45
- False positives (FP): 15
- False negatives (FN): 5
- True negatives (TN): 35

We can calculate the sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) of the screening test as follows:

Sensitivity (True Positive Rate, TPR) = TP / (TP + FN) = 45 / (45 + 5) = 45 / 50 = 0.9 or 90%
Specificity (True Negative Rate, TNR) = TN / (TN + FP) = 35 / (35 + 15) = 35 / 50 = 0.7 or 70%

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A. The new screening test has greater statistical power than the gold standard.
- This statement is not necessarily true. The gold standard is usually the most accurate test available, and comparing statistical power between the new screening test and the gold standard requires additional information.

B. Repeating the study would have no effect on the statistical power of the screening test.
- This statement is false. Repeating the study with a larger sample size could increase the statistical power of the test.

C. The power of the test is 0.8.
- This statement is not directly supported by the given information. The power of the test is related to the sensitivity and specificity, but it also depends on the prevalence of the disease, the sample size, and the significance level (alpha). Without this information, we cannot directly calculate the power.

D. If the specificity of this screening test were increased, the statistical power would increase.
- This statement is not necessarily true. Increasing specificity might lead to a decrease in sensitivity, which could potentially decrease the power of the test. The power of the test is more directly related to sensitivity (true positive rate) than to specificity.

E. If the sensitivity of this screening test were decreased, the statistical power would decrease.
- This statement is true. The statistical power of a screening test is directly related to its sensitivity (true positive rate). Decreasing sensitivity would decrease the power of the test to detect true positives.

Therefore, the most correct statement regarding the statistical power of this new screening test is:

E. If the sensitivity of this screening test were decreased, the statistical power would decrease.",Success
"A 25-year-old woman presents to her new family physician for a follow-up appointment. She previously presented with itching, as well as frequent and painful urination. A vaginal swab was taken and sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. Diplococci were seen on Gram stain and were grown on Thayer-Martin agar. When discussing her infection, the patient says that she uses safe sex practices. Her history is significant for meningitis and for infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Which of the following best describes the component that is likely deficient in this patient?",D,"The patient's history of meningitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, and the current sexually transmitted infection (likely Neisseria gonorrhoeae based on the laboratory findings) suggests a possible deficiency in the complement system, which is part of the innate immune system. Among the options provided, the one that best describes the component that is likely deficient in this patient is:

D. Creates pores in the cell membrane

This refers to the membrane attack complex (MAC), which is formed by the terminal components of the complement system (C5b-C9).

"A 55-year-old woman with papillary thyroid carcinoma underwent total thyroidectomy. She has no significant medical history. On postoperative day 1, she develops perioral numbness and a tingling sensation, along with paresthesia of the hands and feet. The physical examination reveals that she is anxious and confused. Her pulse is 90/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, the respirations are 22/min, and the temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F). Latent tetany (carpal spasm) is evident in the right arm. This is observed when the sphygmomanometer cuff pressure is raised above the systolic blood pressure and held for 3 minutes. The laboratory test results are as follows:
Serum calcium 6.7 mg/dL
Serum sodium 143 mEq/L
Serum potassium 4.4 mEq/L
Serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL
Blood urea 16 mg/dL
Serum magnesium 1.1 mEq/L
What is the most likely cause of this condition?",A,"The most likely cause of the patient's condition is A. Inadvertent surgical removal of parathyroid glands. The symptoms of perioral numbness, tingling sensation, paresthesia of the hands and feet, anxiety, confusion, and the presence of latent tetany (carpal spasm) are consistent with hypocalcemia. The low serum calcium level (6.7 mg/dL, normal range is typically 8.5-10.2 mg/dL) further supports this diagnosis.

Hypocalcemia following a total thyroidectomy is a common complication, often due to the inadvertent removal or damage to the parathyroid glands during surgery. The parathyroid glands are responsible for producing parathyroid hormone (PTH), which plays a critical role in maintaining calcium homeostasis. Damage or removal of these glands can lead to a decrease in PTH production, resulting in hypocalcemia.

The other options are less likely:
B. Congenital absence of parathyroid glands is rare and typically presents much earlier in life.
C. DiGeorge syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the absence or hypoplasia of the parathyroid glands, thymus, and other structures derived from the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches. It is usually diagnosed in childhood and is not typically associated with postoperative complications.
D. Chronic hypomagnesemia can contribute to hypocalcemia, but it is not the primary cause in this scenario. The patient's serum magnesium level is within the normal range, and there is no history or clinical evidence to suggest chronic hypomagnesemia.
E. Hungry bone syndrome is a rare complication that can occur after parathyroidectomy in patients with severe primary hyperparathyroidism. It is characterized by a rapid shift of calcium from the circulation into the bones, leading to hypocalcemia. However, the patient underwent a thyroidectomy, not a parathyroidectomy, and there is no mention of pre-existing hyperparathyroidism.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is the inadvertent surgical removal of parathyroid glands during the total thyroidectomy.",Success

"A 78-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of painful enlarging bruises and skin ulceration over his thighs and external genitalia. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, mitral regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation. Three days ago, he was started on treatment with warfarin. His only other medications are metformin and lisinopril. His temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 108/min and irregularly irregular, and blood pressure is 155/89 mm Hg. Examination of the skin shows large purpura, hemorrhagic bullae, and areas of skin necrosis over his anterior legs, gluteal region, and penis. This patient is most likely to benefit from treatment with which of the following?",B,"The patient's presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of warfarin-induced skin necrosis, which can occur in patients starting anticoagulation therapy, particularly in those with underlying risk factors such as advanced age, diabetes, and valvular heart disease. The treatment of choice in this scenario is to stop the warfarin and administer vitamin K to reverse its anticoagulant effects. However, this option is not listed among the choices provided.

Given the options available, the most appropriate choice for this patient would be:
D. Tranexamic acid
Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent that can help reduce bleeding by inhibiting the breakdown of fibrin clots. While it does not reverse the anticoagulant effects of warfarin, it can help to control bleeding in the acute setting. Vitamin K should also be administered to reverse the effects of warfarin, but since this option is not available, tranexamic acid is the next best choice to help control the bleeding while awaiting the effects of vitamin K.

Options A, B, C, and E are not appropriate for this patient's condition:
A. Hyperbaric oxygen is used to treat conditions such as carbon monoxide poisoning, decompression sickness, and some types of non-healing wounds, but it is not indicated for warfarin-induced skin necrosis.
B. Protein C concentrate is used to treat patients with hereditary or acquired protein C deficiency, which is not relevant to this patient's condition.
C. Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor used as an alternative anticoagulant, and would not be appropriate in this scenario where the patient is already experiencing bleeding complications from warfarin.
E. Vancomycin is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections and would not be appropriate for this patient's condition, which is related to warfarin-induced bleeding and not an infection.",Success
"A 15-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation of a learning disability.

"A 65-year-old woman presented to the emergency room due to progressive dyspnea. She is a known hypertensive but is poorly compliant with medications. The patient claims to have orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and easy fatigability. On physical examination, the blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. There is prominent neck vein distention. An S3 gallop, bibasilar crackles, and grade 3 bipedal edema were also detected. A 2d echo was performed, which showed a decreased ejection fraction (32%). Which of the following drugs should not be given to this patient?",C,"The patient in question is presenting with symptoms and signs consistent with decompensated heart failure, including hypotension (blood pressure of 80/50 mmHg), orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, easy fatigability, neck vein distention, an S3 gallop, bibasilar crackles, and bilateral pedal edema. The 2D echo showing a decreased ejection fraction (32%) further supports the diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Given the patient's hypotension, the drug that should not be given to this patient is:

C. Metoprolol

Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can decrease heart rate and contractility, which can further lower blood pressure. In a patient with severe hypotension, such as the one described, beta-blockers could exacerbate the hypotension and potentially lead to shock. Beta-blockers are typically contraindicated in patients with symptomatic heart failure and hypotension unless there are specific indications and the patient can be closely monitored in an intensive care setting. 

The other options can be considered in the management of heart failure under the right circumstances:

A. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that can help reduce fluid overload and improve symptoms in heart failure.

B. Nesiritide is a B-type natriuretic peptide analog that can be used to relieve symptoms and improve hemodynamics in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

D. Digoxin can be used to help control heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation and can improve symptoms in some patients with heart failure.

E. Dobutamine is an inotropic agent that can increase cardiac output and is often used in patients with severe heart failure and hypotension to improve hemodynamics. However, it should be used with caution due to potential side effects, including arrhythmias and worsening of heart failure symptoms.",Success

Neurological examination is within normal limits. Arterial blood gases analysis shows the following results:
pH 7.49
PaO2 58 mm Hg
PaCO2 30 mm Hg
HCO3-  22 mEq/L
Based on the given data, which of the following could cause respiratory failure in this patient?",A,"The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings suggest that she is experiencing respiratory failure. The most likely cause of her respiratory failure, based on the given options, is:

D. Depression of the respiratory center via opioid receptors activation

The patient has a history of opioid abuse, which can lead to respiratory depression by affecting the brain's respiratory centers, causing hypoventilation and potentially respiratory failure. However, it is important to note that other factors could contribute to her condition, such as her smoking history, which could lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and her recent surgery, which might have led to pulmonary embolism or atelectasis. The bilateral rales over the lower lobes and the presence of an S3 heart sound also suggest possible heart failure, which could contribute to respiratory distress. Nonetheless, given the options provided, opioid-induced respiratory depression is the most likely cause of respiratory failure in this patient. 

However, the arterial blood gases analysis also indicates a type I respiratory failure (hypoxemia without hypercapnia), which could be due to a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, possibly related to pulmonary embolism or heart failure, which can also be a contributing factor in this case. 

The other options (A, B, C, and E) could potentially cause respiratory failure in different scenarios but are less likely based on the information provided.",Success
"A 27-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with acute onset bloody diarrhea. The patient has had severe abdominal pain throughout her entire life with occasional episodes of bloody diarrhea. She has recently lost 7 pounds and has felt generally ill for the past 2 days.

Cocaine: Positive
Marijuana: Positive

Which of the following is the best explanation for this patient's laboratory findings?",E,"The patient's laboratory findings do not specifically point to a single cause, but given her history of impetigo (a streptococcal skin infection), recent generalized seizures, and the presence of bloody diarrhea, option B, an immune response to streptococcal infection, could be a contributing factor to her symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. However, her history of cocaine use and binge drinking also contribute to her condition.

Here's a breakdown of how each of the options relates to the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings:

A. Alcohol-induced liver injury: The patient's history of binge drinking could contribute to liver injury, which is reflected in the elevated AST and ALT levels (62 U/L and 80 U/L, respectively). However, these values are not extremely high, suggesting that while alcohol may be a factor, it is not the sole cause of her symptoms.

B. Immune response to streptococcal infection: The patient's history of impetigo, a skin infection caused by streptococcus or staphylococcus bacteria, could have triggered an immune response that led to systemic inflammation. This could explain her abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. However, the laboratory findings do not specifically point to this as the cause.

C. Intestinal IgA deficiency: This is not supported by the provided information. Intestinal IgA deficiency is typically associated with celiac disease and would not explain the patient's acute symptoms or laboratory findings.

D. Myoglobin toxicity: This is typically associated with muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis) and would present with elevated creatine kinase levels, which are not reported. The patient's creatinine level is elevated (1.8 mg/dL), but this could be due to dehydration or other factors.

E. Protein deposition: This could refer to conditions like amyloidosis, which can affect multiple organs, including the gastrointestinal tract. However, there is no specific evidence in the patient's history or laboratory findings to suggest protein deposition as the primary cause of her symptoms.

Given the patient's history of impetigo, the most likely explanation for her symptoms and laboratory findings is an immune response to a streptococcal infection (option B). However, her alcohol and drug use also play a significant role in her condition and must be considered in her overall care and treatment plan.",Success

Upon discussions with the patient, it is clear that she is not able to understand that sexual intercourse can lead to pregnancy. What should your next step be?",C,"The correct answer is D. Refer the patient to a psychiatrist to get informed consent.

Explanation: In this scenario, the patient is not capable of giving informed consent due to her mental retardation and lack of understanding about the repercussions of sexual intercourse and the implications of the surgery. The ethical principle of autonomy is crucial, and it is essential to ensure that any medical procedure is done with the informed consent of the patient or a legally authorized representative.

On exam, he has painful erythematous cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Black hemorrhagic eschars are noted on his fingertips bilaterally. The pathogen responsible for this patient’s condition produces a virulence factor that has which of the following functions?",C,"The pathogen responsible for this patient's condition is most likely Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague. The black hemorrhagic eschars on his fingertips, along with the painful erythematous lymphadenopathy (buboes), are characteristic of bubonic plague. Yersinia pestis produces a number of virulence factors, including the Plasminogen Activator (Pla) which cleaves plasminogen to plasmin, facilitating the spread of the bacteria by degrading fibrin clots and promoting tissue invasion. However, the most notable virulence factor is the Yersinia Outer Protein (Yop) system, which is a type III secretion system that injects bacterial proteins into host cells, inhibiting phagocytosis and leukocyte migration, and also inhibiting ribosomal function and triggering widespread inflammation. Among the given options, the function that best matches a virulence factor of Yersinia pestis is:

C. Inhibit phagocytosis

This is because Yersinia pestis uses the YopH protein to inhibit the function of macrophages and neutrophils, preventing them from phagocytosing the bacteria. This allows the bacteria to survive and multiply in the host, leading to the severe symptoms of plague.",Success

"A 23-year-old man presents to the office for a circular, itchy rash over the abdomen that has been slowly getting worse for the past 2 weeks. The patient has a medical history of chronic dermatitis and chronic sinusitis for which he has prescriptions of topical hydrocortisone and fexofenadine. He smokes one-half pack of cigarettes every day. His vital signs include: blood pressure 128/76 mm Hg, heart rate 78/min, and respirations 12/min. On physical examination, the patient appears tired but oriented. Examination of the skin reveals a 2 x 2 cm round and erythematous, annular plaque on the abdomen 3 cm to the left of the umbilicus. There are no vesicles, pustules, or papules. Auscultation of the heart reveals a 1/6 systolic murmur. Breath sounds are mildly coarse at the bases. A KOH preparation from the skin scraping confirms the presence of hyphae. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",A,"The next best step in the management of this patient is A. Itraconazole. The KOH preparation from the skin scraping that confirmed the presence of hyphae indicates a fungal infection, most likely a dermatophyte, which is causing the annular rash. Systemic antifungal agents such as itraconazole are often used to treat more extensive or recalcitrant cases of tinea corporis (ringworm of the body), which is consistent with the patient's presentation. Topical treatments may not be as effective for this type of infection, and antibiotics such as doxycycline and topical clindamycin are not indicated for fungal infections. Griseofulvin is another antifungal option, but itraconazole is often preferred due to its better efficacy and shorter treatment duration.",Success
"A 12-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of persistent bleeding from his nose over the past hour. The bleeding started spontaneously. He has no history of a similar episode. He takes no medications. There is no history of abnormal bleeding in the family. His vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, he is pressing a gauze against his left nostril while hyperextending his head. The gauze is stained with blood and upon withdrawal of the gauze blood slowly drips out of his left nostrils. There is no bleeding from the right nostril. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial therapy?",E,"The most appropriate initial therapy for a 12-year-old boy with persistent spontaneous epistaxis (nosebleed) is:

C. Placement of an epinephrine gauze in the left nostril

Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor that can help to reduce bleeding by constricting the blood vessels in the nasal area. This is often the first step in managing a nosebleed that does not stop with simple measures such as pinching the nose and sitting upright. If the bleeding does not stop with epinephrine-soaked gauze, then other options such as anterior packing, silver nitrate cauterization, or oxymetazoline nasal spray may be considered. However, starting with epinephrine is a less invasive option and can often be effective in controlling the bleeding.",Success

He accuses his ex-boss of being a cocaine addict and says he couldn’t keep up sales percentages compared to someone using cocaine. Which of the following psychiatric defense mechanisms is the patient demonstrating?",C,"The patient is demonstrating the psychiatric defense mechanism of Projection. Projection is a defense mechanism where a person unconsciously denies their own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or motives and attributes them to someone else. In this case, the patient is accusing his ex-boss of being a cocaine addict, possibly because he is struggling with his own substance abuse issues (alcohol).

Ring-form trophozoites are absent on the peripheral blood smear. Which of the following organisms is the most likely cause of this patient’s illness?",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and travel history, the most likely cause of her illness is Chikungunya virus (Option B). Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. It is common in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. The virus causes fever and joint pain, particularly in the hands and feet, which can be severe and debilitating. Other symptoms include rash, muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and itching. The patient's symptoms of fever, rash, joint pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms are consistent with Chikungunya virus infection. The absence of ring-form trophozoites on the peripheral blood smear rules out malaria, which could be caused by Babesia or Plasmodium species. Leishmania major causes cutaneous leishmaniasis, which typically presents with skin lesions, not joint pain or fever. Tropheryma whipplei causes Whipple's disease, which typically presents with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and joint pain, not acute fever or rash. Dengue virus can cause similar symptoms to Chikungunya, but the absence of thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) makes it less likely in this case.",Success

As a healthcare provider, it is your duty to respect the patient's autonomy and provide the necessary medical interventions to stabilize his condition. This includes intubation if necessary, administering blood transfusions, and addressing his metabolic abnormalities.

Consulting an ethics committee or obtaining a court order would be unnecessary delays in providing urgent care to a critically ill patient. A psych evaluation may be indicated if there are concerns about the patient's mental capacity to make informed decisions, but this should not prevent the initiation of life-saving measures.

It is important to note that the patient's elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate, ammonia, and lactate levels suggest metabolic derangements that may be associated with his cirrhosis and acute bleeding. These abnormalities need to be addressed as part of his overall management plan.",Success

The patient's symptoms of swelling in the right leg post-surgery, even without pain, could indicate the possibility of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a common complication after major surgeries such as a Whipple's procedure. Compression ultrasonography is a non-invasive imaging technique used to diagnose DVT by compressing the veins with a probe to see if they collapse, which they should do normally. If they do not collapse, it may indicate the presence of a clot.

A D-dimer level (option D) could also be considered to rule out DVT or pulmonary embolism, but it is not as specific as ultrasonography and can be elevated in other conditions as well. CT pulmonary angiography (option A) is used to diagnose pulmonary embolism and is not the first choice for diagnosing DVT.

His father died of sudden cardiac death at the age of 45 years without a history of hypertension or any chronic cardiac disorder. A complete physical examination was normal. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevations in V1, V2, and V3, and the presence of incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB). After a complete diagnostic evaluation, Brugada syndrome was diagnosed. He has prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers.

"A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for recurrent vomiting that began 5 hours ago. He describes the vomitus as bloody and containing black specks. He drinks 10–12 beers daily and has not seen a physician in 15 years. He appears pale. His temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 122/min, and blood pressure is 85/59 mm Hg. Physical examination shows decreased radial pulses, delayed capillary refill, multiple spider angiomata, and a distended abdomen. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. Which of the following is most likely decreased in this patient in response to his current condition compared to a healthy adult?",C,"The patient's presentation is consistent with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely secondary to esophageal varices or peptic ulcer disease, given his history of heavy alcohol use and the presence of spider angiomata (suggestive of liver disease). The clinical findings of hypotension (85/59 mm Hg), tachycardia (122/min), decreased radial pulses, and delayed capillary refill indicate hypovolemic shock due to blood loss.

In response to this condition, several compensatory mechanisms are expected to occur in an attempt to maintain perfusion to vital organs. Among the options provided, the most likely to be decreased in this patient compared to a healthy adult is:

C. Carotid baroreceptor firing activity

Baroreceptors, primarily located in the carotid sinus and aortic arch, are sensitive to changes in blood pressure. In response to hypotension, baroreceptors decrease their firing rate, leading to activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This results in an increase in heart rate (tachycardia), vasoconstriction (increased systemic vascular resistance), and potentially increased cardiac contractility (inotropy) to help maintain blood pressure. Therefore, in this patient, the carotid baroreceptor firing activity would be decreased as part of the body's compensatory response to hypotension.

It is important to note that systemic vascular resistance (A) and cardiac inotropy (E) are expected to increase in response to hypovolemic shock, while fractional tissue oxygen extraction (B) would likely increase as tissues attempt to compensate for reduced oxygen delivery. Pulmonary vascular resistance (D) is not typically affected by acute blood loss and is not a primary compensatory mechanism in this scenario.",Success
"A 69-year-old male with a longstanding history of hypertension and high cholesterol presents with abdominal pain and ‘bruising on his feet’.

Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air.

Bowel sounds present. A pulsatile abdominal mass is felt in the lower umbilical region. Patient’s feet have the following appearance seen in the picture. Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm). High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are initiated. Morphine sulfate and metoprolol are administered. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?
 ",E,"Given the patient's history and the size of the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), the best course of treatment would be:

C. Elective endovascular repair

The patient has a small, unruptured AAA with a diameter of 4.1 cm. Typically, for aneurysms between 3.5 and 5.5 cm in diameter, elective repair is considered to prevent the risk of rupture, which can be life-threatening. Endovascular repair is often preferred over open surgical repair for smaller aneurysms and in patients with higher surgical risk factors, such as this patient's history of hypertension, high cholesterol, smoking, and alcohol use. However, the decision between endovascular and open repair should also take into account the anatomy of the aneurysm and the patient's overall health status.

Emergency open surgical repair (option E) is not indicated as the aneurysm is not ruptured or symptomatic in a way that would require immediate intervention. Discharging the patient with surveillance (options A and B) is not the best choice given the patient's significant risk factors and the presence of a pulsatile mass on examination, which suggests the aneurysm may be expanding and poses a higher risk of rupture.",Success

What could be the most likely cause of her hoarseness?",B,"The most likely cause of the patient's hoarseness after a partial thyroidectomy is a recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (Option B). The recurrent laryngeal nerve is responsible for innervating the muscles that control the vocal cords. If this nerve is damaged during surgery, it can result in hoarseness or loss of voice due to paralysis of the vocal cords. The nerve runs in close proximity to the inferior thyroid artery, and thus is at risk of injury when this artery is ligated during thyroid surgery.",Success
"A 17-year-old man presents to his family physician for an evaluation about the size of his penis.

The cardiopulmonary examination is normal; however, the patient has difficulty identifying coffee grounds by smell. Which of the following explains the pathophysiology underlying this patient’s disorder?",B,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome, which is characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia (loss of the sense of smell). Kallmann syndrome is often caused by a mutation in genes that are involved in the development of the olfactory and GnRH systems. The most common genetic cause is a mutation in the KAL1 gene, which is located on the X chromosome. However, mutations in other genes, including FGFR1, PROK2, PROKR2, CHD7, and others, can also cause Kallmann syndrome.

Among the options provided, the most likely explanation for the pathophysiology underlying this patient's disorder is:

B. Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency

Kallmann syndrome is a form of isolated GnRH deficiency, which results in delayed or absent puberty due to the lack of GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus. This leads to low levels of gonadotropins (LH and FSH) and subsequently low levels of sex steroids (testosterone in males and estrogen in females). The anosmia in this patient is also a characteristic feature of Kallmann syndrome, as the olfactory bulbs are often underdeveloped or absent.

The other options are not as directly related to the patient's symptoms:

A. Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat is associated with myotonic dystrophy, not Kallmann syndrome.
C. Sex-specific epigenetic imprinting is involved in the development of certain genetic disorders, but it is not a direct cause of Kallmann syndrome.
D. Leptin receptor mutation is associated with obesity and hypothalamic dysfunction, not Kallmann syndrome.

Chest exam reveals a deep noise found bilaterally in the lung bases. Chest radiograph reveals a wider area of opacity near the heart and bilateral lung infiltrates. Which of the following is characteristic of the most likely organism responsible for this patient's symptoms?",C,"The patient's symptoms and the chest radiograph findings are most consistent with pneumonia. The presence of bilateral lung infiltrates and the deep noise found bilaterally in the lung bases (likely rales or rhonchi) suggest a diffuse process, which could be due to a variety of pathogens. However, given the recent travel to South America and the presence of bilateral lung infiltrates, the most likely organism responsible for this patient's symptoms is Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

However, none of the options provided directly match Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Option B, ""Cultured on charcoal and yeast,"" could be misleading but is closest to the correct answer as Mycoplasma pneumoniae can be cultured on special media that includes yeast extract. However, this is not specific to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, as other organisms can also grow on media containing charcoal and yeast.

Option E, ""Polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate capsule,"" is characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a common cause of pneumonia, but the clinical presentation and radiographic findings do not strongly suggest this organism over Mycoplasma pneumoniae in this context.

Option C, ""D-glutamate capsule,"" is characteristic of Bacillus anthracis, which does not fit the clinical presentation.

Option D, ""Found in desert sand,"" could refer to Coccidioides immitis, which causes Valley fever and is found in the arid regions of the southwestern United States and parts of South America, but the clinical presentation does not strongly suggest this diagnosis.

Option A, ""Captain's wheel appearance,"" refers to the characteristic appearance of the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae on Gram stain, which does not fit the clinical presentation.

Given the options provided and the clinical context, the closest answer to the most likely organism responsible for this patient's symptoms is:

His clothes appear dirty. Small scars are visible in the decubitus region of both arms. The lung sounds are equal with bilateral crackles, and heart auscultation reveals a systolic murmur that radiates to the left axilla. Petechiae are seen on the hard palate and palms of his hands. A chest X-ray and blood cultures are ordered. What is the most likely organism causing his symptoms?",C,"The patient's symptoms and signs are most consistent with a severe bacterial infection, likely pneumonia, given his fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain. The presence of bilateral crackles on lung auscultation and the chest X-ray that was ordered further support this diagnosis. The patient's history of smoking and heavy alcohol use are risk factors for bacterial pneumonia.

The physical exam findings of petechiae on the hard palate and palms, along with a systolic murmur radiating to the left axilla, suggest a possible endocarditis, which can be a complication of certain types of bacterial infections, including those caused by Staphylococcus aureus.

Staphylococcus aureus (Option C) is a common cause of both pneumonia and endocarditis, and it can present with the symptoms and signs described. The small scars in the decubitus region of both arms could suggest a history of intravenous drug use, which is another risk factor for Staphylococcus aureus infection, including endocarditis.

Therefore, the most likely organism causing the patient's symptoms is Staphylococcus aureus (Option C).

Options A (Streptococci viridans), B (Enterococci), D (Aspergillus fumigatus), and E (Staphylococcus epidermidis) are less likely based on the patient's presentation. Streptococci viridans and Enterococci are less commonly associated with the clinical picture described, and Aspergillus fumigatus is a fungal organism that typically causes infection in immunocompromised individuals or those with underlying lung disease, which is not suggested in this patient's history.

These hormones can cause the symptoms described when released in excess.

Given the description of the symptoms and the options provided, the most likely answer is:

B. B

This is because the adrenal medulla, where pheochromocytomas originate, is typically found in region B of an adrenal gland histology slide. Region A would be the adrenal cortex, which does not produce the hormones associated with pheochromocytoma symptoms.

Which of the following is a feature of this patient condition?",C,"The feature of this patient's condition that is described among the options is:
C. It is a diagnosis of exclusion

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, a condition that arises due to liver failure or cirrhosis where the liver is unable to remove toxins from the blood. This leads to the accumulation of substances that can affect the brain, causing confusion, disorientation, and other neurological symptoms. Hepatic encephalopathy is often a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning other causes of the symptoms must be ruled out before the diagnosis can be confirmed. This is because symptoms like confusion can be caused by various conditions, including infections, electrolyte imbalances, and medication side effects.

Other options are not correct for the following reasons:
A. It carries a good prognosis - This is not true for hepatic encephalopathy, especially in the context of advanced liver disease such as cirrhosis. The prognosis can be poor, depending on the underlying liver condition and the severity of the encephalopathy.
B. Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis - While elevated ammonia levels can be a marker of hepatic encephalopathy, they are not always elevated, and other tests and clinical assessment are also crucial in making the diagnosis.
D. It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis - While cirrhosis is a common cause of hepatic encephalopathy, it can also occur in other conditions that lead to liver failure or portosystemic shunting.

He takes no medications and denies smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and illicit drug use. Prior to starting his run, his heart rate was 70/min, and the blood pressure was 114/74 mm Hg. Immediately after stopping his run, the heart rate is 130/min, and the blood pressure is 145/75 mm Hg. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the change in his heart rate and blood pressure?",D,"The most likely explanation for the increase in heart rate and blood pressure during exercise is D. Sympathetic nervous system activation. During exercise, the body needs to increase blood flow to the muscles and organs that are working harder. The sympathetic nervous system, which is part of the autonomic nervous system, is responsible for the ""fight or flight"" response and is activated during exercise. This activation leads to an increase in heart rate, cardiac output, and blood pressure, which helps to deliver more oxygen and nutrients to the working muscles.

The baroreceptor reflex (option A) is a mechanism that helps to regulate blood pressure by adjusting the heart rate and blood vessel tone. While it does play a role in blood pressure regulation during exercise, it is not the primary cause of the increase in heart rate and blood pressure during physical activity.

Increased activation of the vagal nuclei (option B) would have the opposite effect, leading to a decrease in heart rate and blood pressure, which is not consistent with the scenario described.

Increased aldosterone production (option C) would lead to increased sodium and water retention, which could contribute to an increase in blood pressure over time. However, it is not an immediate response to exercise and would not explain the acute increase in heart rate and blood pressure.

Vasopressin release from the pituitary (option E) can contribute to blood pressure regulation by promoting water reabsorption in the kidneys and increasing blood volume. However, it is not a primary factor in the immediate increase in heart rate and blood pressure during exercise.",Success
"A 14-year-old obese boy presents with severe right hip and knee pain. The patient says that he has been limping with mild pain for the past three weeks, but the pain acutely worsened today. He describes the pain as severe, non-radiating, sharp and aching in character, and localized to the right hip and knee joints. The patient denies recent illness, travel, trauma, or similar symptoms in the past. No significant past medical history and no current medications. The patient is not sexually active and denies any alcohol, smoking or drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, pulse 72/min, respiratory rate 15/min, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Body mass index (BMI) is 32 kg/m2. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The right leg is externally rotated, and there is a limited range of motion in the right hip. Strength is 4 out of 5 at the right hip joint and 5 out of 5 elsewhere. There is no tenderness to palpation. No joint erythema, edema or effusion present. Sensation is intact. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory tests are unremarkable. Plain radiographs of the right hip joint are significant for displacement of the right femoral head inferoposterior off the femoral neck. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of treatment for this patient?",E,"The most appropriate course of treatment for this patient is E. Surgical pinning of the right hip. The patient's symptoms and the radiographic findings are indicative of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), a common cause of hip pain in adolescents, particularly those who are obese. SCFE is a serious condition that requires prompt treatment to prevent further displacement and potential complications such as avascular necrosis of the femoral head.

"A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of a progressive development of tender breast tissue over the past 18 months. He used to ride his bicycle for exercise 4 times a week but stopped after he had an accident and injured his left testicle 3 months ago. He has gained 5 kg (11 lb) during this period. For the last 10 years, he drinks one to two beers daily and sometimes more on weekends. He occasionally takes pantoprazole for heartburn. He is 171 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 87 kg (192 lb); BMI is 30 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows bilaterally symmetrical, mildly tender gynecomastia. A nontender 1.5-cm mass is palpated in the left testis; transillumination test is negative. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?",A,"The most likely underlying cause of the patient's findings is B. Obesity. The patient's BMI of 30 kg/m2 indicates that he is obese, which can lead to hormonal imbalances including increased estrogen levels, contributing to gynecomastia. The patient's history of alcohol consumption and recent weight gain also support this diagnosis. The nontender mass in the left testis may be a separate issue that requires further investigation, but it is not the most likely cause of the gynecomastia.",Success
"A 58-year-old man comes to the physician because he is unable to achieve erections during sexual intercourse. He first noticed the problem 8 months ago, when he became sexually active with a new girlfriend. He states that his relationship with his girlfriend is good, but his inability to engage in sexual intercourse has been frustrating. He has hyperlipidemia and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder 3 years ago. He works as a lawyer and enjoys his job, but he has had a great deal of stress lately. He had not been sexually active for the previous 3 years, since the death of his wife. He does not smoke. He drinks 4–6 beers on weekends. Current medications include simvastatin and citalopram. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 135/82 mm Hg. BMI is 30 kg/m2. Pedal pulses are difficult to palpate. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The most appropriate next step in management for this patient would be option E, switching citalopram to bupropion. Citalopram is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) antidepressant, which is known to cause sexual side effects including erectile dysfunction. Bupropion, on the other hand, is less likely to cause sexual dysfunction and can sometimes improve sexual function in patients taking other SSRIs. Before considering more invasive treatments such as penile prosthesis insertion or intracavernous injections, it would be prudent to address potential medication side effects. Psychotherapy could also be beneficial, but addressing the medication issue first may resolve the erectile dysfunction, making psychotherapy a secondary consideration. Nocturnal penile tumescence testing can help differentiate between organic and psychogenic causes of erectile dysfunction, but it is not the first-line management in this case.",Success
"A 5-year-old male presents to the pediatrician with a 10-day history of cough that is worse at night. The patient has a history of mild intermittent asthma and has been using his albuterol inhaler without relief. He has also been complaining of headache and sore throat, and his mother has noticed worsening rhinorrhea. The patient’s past medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and he has no known drug allergies. In the office, his temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 88/65 mmHg, pulse is 132/min, and respirations are 16/min. The patient has purulent mucus draining from the nares, and his face is tender to palpation over the maxillary sinuses. His pharynx is erythematous with symmetric swelling of the tonsils. On lung exam, he has moderate bilateral expiratory wheezing.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it appears that he is experiencing an exacerbation of his asthma in the context of an upper respiratory tract infection with possible sinusitis and pharyngitis. The presence of fever, purulent nasal discharge, facial tenderness, and erythematous pharynx with swollen tonsils suggests a bacterial superinfection.

The best next step in management would be to prescribe an antibiotic that covers common respiratory pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, which are common causes of sinusitis and pharyngitis. Among the options provided, amoxicillin (Option A) is typically the first-line antibiotic for these conditions in a patient without a history of penicillin allergy. However, given the recent use of albuterol without relief and the severity of symptoms, it is possible that the bacteria causing the infection may be resistant to amoxicillin alone.

Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (Option B) is a better choice in this scenario because clavulanic acid inhibits beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, which can make the amoxicillin more effective against resistant strains. This combination is often used for more severe or resistant infections of the respiratory tract.

Options C (ampicillin-sulbactam), D (clindamycin), and E (levofloxacin) are not typically first-line choices for respiratory tract infections in children. Ampicillin-sulbactam is usually reserved for more severe or hospital-acquired infections, clindamycin is often used for MRSA or anaerobic infections, and levofloxacin is not recommended for use in children due to potential adverse effects on cartilage.

Therefore, the best next step in management for this patient would be:

B. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid

Additionally, it would be appropriate to continue the use of the albuterol inhaler as needed for asthma symptoms and consider the addition of a short course of oral corticosteroids to help reduce airway inflammation. Monitoring the patient's response to treatment and reassessing in a few days would also be important.",Success

The patient is left to grieve but upon entering the room again you notice that the patient has new lacerations over her wrists and that some of the medical equipment in the room is broken. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The most likely diagnosis in this scenario is C. Borderline personality disorder. The patient's rapid shift from extreme gratitude to anger and aggression, coupled with self-harming behavior (lacerations on her wrists) and destruction of property (breaking medical equipment), are indicative of borderline personality disorder. This condition is characterized by unstable emotions, relationships, and self-image, and impulsive behaviors, which can include self-harm. The patient's history of substance abuse may also be a contributing factor, as substance use disorders are common in individuals with borderline personality disorder.

"A 45-year-old female presents to the emergency department with gross hematuria and acute, colicky flank pain. She denies any previous episodes of hematuria. She reports taking high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin over several weeks due to persistent upper back pain. The patient’s blood pressure and temperature are normal, but she is found to have proteinuria. Physical examination is negative for palpable flank masses. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis:",D,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is E. Acute Nephrolithiasis. The patient’s presentation of gross hematuria, acute colicky flank pain, and the absence of fever or hypertension points towards a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis, or kidney stones. The patient’s use of high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin could potentially contribute to kidney issues, but the symptoms described are most consistent with kidney stones.

Options A, B, and C (Diffuse cortical necrosis, Chronic pyelonephritis, and Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease) are less likely because they typically present with different symptoms or have a more chronic course. Diffuse cortical necrosis is a rare form of acute kidney injury that usually occurs in the setting of severe sepsis or shock, which is not present in this case. Chronic pyelonephritis would likely present with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections and possibly hypertension. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease usually presents with a family history of the disease and symptoms such as hypertension, abdominal pain, and hematuria, but it is less likely to present acutely with colicky pain.

Option D, Papillary necrosis, can be a complication of analgesic abuse, but it typically presents with symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting, and flank pain that is not colicky in nature.

He used to have some success with over-the-counter NSAIDs; however, they no longer help. The patient also has been taking metformin for the past 2 years and is severely obese, with a BMI of 41 kg/m2. Additionally, he states that he has felt increasingly tired during the day, often dozes off during work, and no longer feels refreshed when he wakes up in the morning. Upon examination, there is no tenderness on palpation or erythema; however, some crepitus is felt. He has no other complaints but has a family history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on his mother’s side. Which of the following factors is the underlying cause of the patient’s pain, as well as the rest of his complaints?",C,"The underlying cause of the patient's pain, as well as the rest of his complaints, is most likely (C) Excess weight. The patient's severe obesity (BMI of 41 kg/m2) is a significant risk factor for osteoarthritis, which is characterized by pain and stiffness in the joints, especially knees, that worsens with activity and improves with rest. The patient's symptoms of increased bilateral knee pain that limits mobility, worsens at the end of the day, and is accompanied by early-morning stiffness lasting about 20 minutes are consistent with osteoarthritis. The patient's history of obesity and lack of response to NSAIDs also support this diagnosis. The patient's complaints of increased daytime tiredness and dozing off during work, as well as not feeling refreshed when waking up in the morning, may be related to sleep apnea, which is commonly associated with obesity. The patient's family history of rheumatoid arthritis does not necessarily suggest that this is the underlying cause of his symptoms, as his presentation is more consistent with osteoarthritis.

"A 40-year-old man comes to the physician because of shortness of breath, double vision, and fatigue for the past 4 weeks. He has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications. Physical examination shows drooping of the eyelids bilaterally. He is unable to hold his arms up for longer than 3 minutes. A CT scan of the chest shows an anterior mediastinal mass with smooth contours. A photomicrograph of a specimen from the mass is shown. Which of the following immunologic processes normally occurs in the region indicated by the arrow?",E,"The region indicated by the arrow in the photomicrograph of the specimen from the anterior mediastinal mass is most likely the thymus. The thymus is an organ critical for the development of the immune system, particularly in the maturation of T-lymphocytes (T-cells). Among the options provided, the process that normally occurs in the thymus is:

D. Thymocyte formation

Thymocytes are immature T-cells that migrate from the bone marrow to the thymus, where they undergo a series of maturation steps. The thymus provides a specialized microenvironment that supports the development of these cells into functional T-lymphocytes. This process includes both positive and negative selection, ensuring that T-cells are properly educated to recognize foreign antigens while avoiding self-reactivity, which could lead to autoimmune diseases.

The clinical presentation of the patient, including shortness of breath, double vision, and fatigue, along with the physical examination findings of drooping eyelids (ptosis) and muscle weakness, are suggestive of myasthenia gravis (MG). MG is an autoimmune disorder characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of any of the muscles under voluntary control. The presence of an anterior mediastinal mass in this context could indicate a thymoma, which is often associated with MG. The thymus plays a role in the pathogenesis of MG, as it is often enlarged in patients with the disease and may contain ectopic germinal centers that contribute to the autoimmune response.",Success

On examination, the thyroid is stony hard, tender and asymmetrically enlarged. There is also pain associated with swallowing. Laboratory studies show a serum T4 level of 4.4 μg/dL and a TSH level of 6.3 mU/L. A radionuclide thyroid scanning indicates that the nodule has low radioactive iodine uptake. Which of the following is the most likely pathology to be found in this patient?",D,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings in this patient are most consistent with D. Riedel thyroiditis. Riedel thyroiditis is a rare, chronic, inflammatory disorder characterized by a hard, fixed, and often painful enlargement of the thyroid gland. It is associated with a normal or slightly elevated TSH level, which is seen in this patient (6.3 mU/L), and normal or slightly decreased free T4 levels (4.4 μg/dL). The low radioactive iodine uptake on radionuclide thyroid scanning is also typical of Riedel thyroiditis.

The other options can be considered less likely based on the patient's presentation:

A. Anaplastic carcinoma typically presents with a rapidly enlarging thyroid mass, but it is not usually associated with the systemic symptoms described (constipation, fatigue, cold intolerance) and would not typically present with normal or slightly decreased T4 levels.

B. Medullary carcinoma can present with a thyroid nodule, but it is not typically associated with the systemic symptoms described and would not be expected to have a low radioactive iodine uptake on scanning.

C. Granulomatous thyroiditis (also known as subacute thyroiditis) is characterized by a painful, tender thyroid gland, but it usually presents with a transient thyrotoxicosis due to the release of stored thyroid hormone, which is not seen in this patient.

E.

"A researcher is testing an unknown compound, X, and seeing the effect it has on renal function. When she applies compound X to the cells, she finds that the urinary concentration of sodium and the pH decreases while the urinary potassium increases. Which of the following correctly states:
1) the cells of the kidney this compound acts on and
2) the identity of compound X?",D,"The correct answer is E. Principal cells; spironolactone.

Explanation: The compound X is causing an increase in urinary potassium, a decrease in urinary sodium, and a decrease in pH (indicating increased acid excretion). This pattern is consistent with the action of spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist. Spironolactone blocks the action of aldosterone in the principal cells of the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct, which normally promote sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. By blocking aldosterone, spironolactone causes increased sodium excretion and potassium retention, leading to the observed effects on urinary electrolyte concentrations. The decreased pH suggests increased hydrogen ion secretion, which is also consistent with the action of spironolactone in the distal tubule and collecting duct.",Success

The patient's presentation, including his history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes, along with his current symptoms of chest pain, tachycardia, and hypotension, suggest a cardiac event. The irregular pulse and the ECG findings (not described in detail but likely showing arrhythmia) are indicative of a possible life-threatening arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response or ventricular tachycardia. Intravenous amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication that can help to stabilize the cardiac rhythm and is often used in the management of unstable arrhythmias. However, it should be noted that the specific ECG findings would guide the precise treatment choice, and if the arrhythmia is shockable (such as ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia), defibrillation (option E) would be the immediate treatment of choice. If the patient is hemodynamically stable with a wide complex tachycardia, a synchronized cardioversion (option D) may be considered. Coronary angiogram (option A) and intravenous esmolol (option B) may be appropriate in different clinical scenarios but are not the most urgent interventions for this patient's presentation.",Success
"A 14-year-old boy presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and is found on ultrasound to have a gallstone. Based on clinical suspicion, a CBC, a Coombs test, and a bilirubin panel are obtained to determine the etiology of the gallstone. These tests reveal a mild normocytic anemia with associated reticulocytosis as well as an increased RDW. In addition there is an indirect hyperbilirubinemia and the Coombs test results are negative. To confirm the diagnosis, an osmotic fragility test is performed which shows increased fragility in hypotonic solution. In this patient, what findings would most likely be anticipated if a blood smear were obtained?",D,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. The presence of a gallstone, anemia, reticulocytosis, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and increased osmotic fragility are all characteristic of this condition. Hereditary spherocytosis is an inherited disorder that affects the shape of red blood cells, causing them to become spherical (spherocytes) instead of the usual biconcave disc shape. These spherocytes are more fragile and break down more easily than normal red blood cells, leading to hemolysis and the associated laboratory findings.

Given these findings, the most likely anticipated finding on a blood smear would be:

A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of a tingling sensation in his right forearm. He reports that his symptoms started after he lifted heavy weights at the gym. Physical examination shows loss of sensation on the lateral side of the right forearm. Sensation over the thumb is intact. Range of motion of the neck is normal. His symptoms do not worsen with axial compression or distraction of the neck. Further examination of this patient is most likely to show weakness of which of the following actions?,B,"The symptoms described in the patient suggest a possible injury to a nerve in the right forearm. The loss of sensation on the lateral side of the forearm and intact sensation over the thumb indicates that the nerve affected is likely the radial nerve, as it is responsible for sensation in the lateral forearm and the dorsal aspect of the thumb, index, and middle fingers. However, since the sensation over the thumb is intact, this narrows down the possible location of the injury to a more distal part of the radial nerve or a branch of it.

The radial nerve also innervates several muscles in the forearm and upper arm, including those responsible for wrist extension, finger extension, and forearm supination. Given the symptoms and the location of the affected area, the most likely action to be weakened would be wrist extension, which is primarily controlled by the extensor muscles of the forearm innervated by the radial nerve.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

E. Wrist extension",Success
"A 30-year-old woman presents to your office with decreased appetite, malaise, and fever. Serologic tests reveal positive Anti-HBsAg and Anti-HAV IgM antibodies. Which of the following is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation?",C,"The presence of positive Anti-HBsAg and Anti-HAV IgM antibodies indicates that the patient has been exposed to both Hepatitis B and Hepatitis A viruses. However, the Anti-HAV IgM antibody is particularly indicative of a recent Hepatitis A infection, as IgM antibodies are the first to respond to an acute infection. Hepatitis A can be contracted through the consumption of contaminated food or water, particularly shellfish that have not been properly cooked (Option C). Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's presentation is a recent Hepatitis A infection, which can present with symptoms such as decreased appetite, malaise, and fever. 

Options A, B, and E are less likely to be the primary cause of the patient's symptoms, although they could be risk factors for acquiring Hepatitis B. Option D, chronic hepatitis, could be a concern given the positive Anti-HBsAg, but the acute symptoms and the presence of Anti-HAV IgM suggest an acute infection, likely Hepatitis A.",Success
"A 63-year-old patient presents to the emergency department because of severe left leg pain and tingling. His condition started suddenly 30 minutes ago. He has had hypertension for the past 10 years for which he takes bisoprolol. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), the blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 100/min and irregular. On physical examination, the patient appears in severe pain and his left leg is pale and cool. The popliteal pulse is weaker on the left side compared to the right side. Which of the following is the most common cause of this patient's condition?",D,"The most common cause of this patient's condition is arterial emboli (Option D). The sudden onset of severe leg pain, tingling, and the physical examination findings of a pale and cool leg with a weaker popliteal pulse on the left side compared to the right side are consistent with an acute arterial occlusion. The patient's history of hypertension and medication use (bisoprolol) suggests a potential source of emboli, possibly from cardiac pathology such as atrial fibrillation, which can lead to embolic events.",Success
"A 17-year-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her father for evaluation. He is concerned that she has not undergone puberty yet, while all of her classmates at school have. The patient herself feels well overall, with no specific complaints. Examination shows vital signs of T 98.9, HR 71, and BP 137/92. The physician notes undeveloped breasts and normal external and internal female genitalia in Tanner I stage of development. Her body mass index is within normal limits, she is in the 40th percentile for height, and she is agreeable and pleasant during the interview. Which of the following additional findings is likely present in this patient?",B,"The patient's presentation is most consistent with delayed puberty, which can be caused by a variety of factors. Given the information provided, the most likely additional finding is:

D. XY karyotype

This would suggest a diagnosis of androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), which can present with delayed or absent puberty in a phenotypically female individual. AIS is a condition in which an individual has a 46,XY karyotype but is resistant to androgens, leading to underdevelopment of secondary sexual characteristics. However, it is important to note that other causes of delayed puberty should also be considered, and further testing, including hormonal assays and genetic testing, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Options A, B, C, and E are less likely based on the information provided:

A. Aromatase enzyme deficiency would typically present with virilization in females due to the inability to convert androgens to estrogens.

B. Hypokalemia is not typically associated with delayed puberty.

C. Increased levels of sex hormones would not be expected in a patient with delayed puberty.

E. Hypercortisolism, or Cushing's syndrome, can affect pubertal development, but it would typically present with additional symptoms such as central obesity, purple striae, and hypertension that are not mentioned in the patient's presentation.",Success
"Current recommendations state that a single hemoglobin A1c value of greater than 6.5% is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. If this 6.5% cut-off is to be increased to 7.0%, which of the following would be true?",A,"If the cut-off for diagnosing diabetes based on hemoglobin A1c is increased from 6.5% to 7.0%, the following would be true:

A. Increase in false negative test results

Explanation: By increasing the cut-off, fewer individuals with A1c levels between 6.5% and 7.0% would be diagnosed with diabetes. This means that some individuals who would have been diagnosed with diabetes under the 6.5% threshold would now be classified as non-diabetic, leading to an increase in false negative results (people who have the disease but are not diagnosed as such). 

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:
B. False positive test results would decrease, not increase, as the higher cut-off would make it more difficult for individuals to meet the diagnostic criteria for diabetes.
C. True negative test results would increase, not decrease, as more individuals would be correctly classified as non-diabetic.
D. True positive test results would decrease, not increase, as fewer individuals would meet the higher diagnostic criteria.
E. Test specificity would increase, not decrease, as the test would be more specific in identifying those without diabetes.",Success
"Patients with the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia make a specific type of hemoglobin known as HgbS. This mutation results in the sickling of their red blood cells when exposed to inciting factors such as hypoxic conditions. Patients are often treated with hydroxyurea, which has which of the following direct effects on their hemoglobin physiology?",C,"The correct answer is C. Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF).

Hydroxyurea is used in the treatment of sickle cell anemia because it increases the production of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF). Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin and does not sickle. By increasing HgbF levels, hydroxyurea helps to reduce the proportion of HgbS in the red blood cells, thereby decreasing the frequency and severity of sickling episodes. This can lead to a reduction in pain crises and other complications associated with sickle cell anemia.",Success
"A 40-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. He has a history of cirrhosis of the liver secondary to alcoholism. He started becoming more confused a few days ago and it has been getting gradually worse. His temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 134/90 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals a distended abdomen that is non-tender. Neurological exam is notable for a confused patient and asterixis. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 3.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 22 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 59 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best next treatment for this patient?",D,"The patient's presentation is consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver disease characterized by altered mental status and asterixis. The laboratory values do not indicate an immediate electrolyte imbalance that would require urgent correction (e.g., severe hypokalemia), and the patient's temperature and blood pressure are within normal limits. The patient's glucose level is low (59 mg/dL), but not critically so, and would not typically be the primary focus in this context.

Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and the symptoms presented, the best next treatment would be to address hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose (Option C) and rifaximin (Option E) are both used in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose works by decreasing the production and absorption of ammonia in the gut, while rifaximin is an antibiotic that reduces the production of ammonia and other toxins by gut bacteria.

Between lactulose and rifaximin, lactulose is often the first-line treatment for hepatic encephalopathy due to its effectiveness and safety profile. Rifaximin may be used in conjunction with lactulose or as a second-line treatment in cases where lactulose is not effective.

Therefore, the best next treatment for this patient is lactulose (Option C).",Success
A previously healthy 4-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents because she has not stopped crying for the past 5 hours.

She was born at term via vaginal delivery and her delivery was uncomplicated. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a reddened and swollen 2nd toe of the left foot. A photograph of the left foot is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,D,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is D. Hair tourniquet syndrome. The presentation of a swollen and reddened toe, especially in a young child who has been crying persistently and is unable to be calmed, is highly suggestive of this diagnosis. Hair tourniquet syndrome occurs when a strand of hair or other fine fiber wraps tightly around a digit, causing constriction and subsequent swelling, pain, and sometimes discoloration. It is a common cause of unexplained pain and swelling in infants and young children. The other options listed do not typically present with such localized swelling and pain in a toe without a history of trauma.",Success

Her past medical history is significant for asthma and eczema. She has no history of any serious illness and takes no medications. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormal findings. An endoscopic image of the esophagus is shown. Mucosal biopsy shows eosinophilic infiltration. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time?,E,"The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for a patient with eosinophilic infiltration in the esophageal mucosa, as described in the case, is Budesonide (Option B). This condition is indicative of Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE), which is an inflammatory disease characterized by eosinophil-predominant inflammation of the esophagus. Budesonide is a corticosteroid that can be used to reduce inflammation in the esophagus and is often prescribed in the form of an oral viscous suspension to be swallowed to treat EoE.

Amlodipine (Option A) is a calcium channel blocker used to treat hypertension and angina, and it is not indicated for EoE.

Fluconazole (Option C) is an antifungal medication and would not be appropriate for treating EoE.

Nitroglycerin (Option D) is a vasodilator used for angina and heart conditions and is not indicated for EoE.

"A 2-year-old boy in respiratory distress is brought to the emergency department by his parents. They state that approximately one hour after putting their child to sleep, a ""hacking"" cough was heard from his bedroom. After entering his room the parents state their child appeared to be in distress, making a high pitched noise with every breath. Beyond a runny nose for the past few days, the child has been healthy. He has no toys in his bed or access to any other small objects. Physical exam demonstrates a 2-year-old child in respiratory distress.

Which of the following choices is the proper management for this patient?",C,"The proper management for this patient, given the symptoms and the description provided, is:

C. Dexamethasone, racemic epinephrine, and observation for 4 hours; discharge if stridor remits

The high-pitched noise with every breath, which is likely stridor, and the recent onset of a ""hacking"" cough suggest an acute upper airway obstruction. This is often seen in conditions like croup, which is an inflammatory condition that affects the larynx and trachea, particularly common in children aged 6 months to 3 years. The absence of small objects or toys in the bed reduces the likelihood of a foreign body aspiration, although it cannot be completely ruled out without further examination.

Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation in the airway, and racemic epinephrine can provide immediate relief of airway swelling. Observation for 4 hours allows for monitoring the patient's response to treatment and ensuring that stridor has resolved before discharge. If stridor persists or worsens, further intervention such as nebulized epinephrine, intubation, or bronchoscopy may be necessary. However, based on the initial presentation, option C is the most appropriate first step in management.",Success

Treatment with a drug that directly antagonizes the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways is begun. Which of the following drugs was most likely started?,D,"The drug that directly antagonizes the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways is most likely tiotropium (Option D). Tiotropium is a long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator that blocks the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in bronchoconstriction, on muscarinic receptors in the airways.

This pregnancy was most likely which of the following?",A,"The scenario described is most consistent with Option B: Dichorionic-diamniotic dizygotic twins. This means that the two newborns are fraternal (dizygotic) twins, each having developed from a separate egg fertilized by a separate sperm. They have separate placentas (dichorionic) and separate amniotic sacs (diamniotic).

The differences in size and the presence of congenital anomalies in one twin (flattened nose and clubfoot) while the other appears normal, along with the significant difference in hematocrit levels (which can be a sign of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome but is less likely in dizygotic twins), suggest that they are not identical (monozygotic) twins sharing a placenta (monochorionic). The lack of prenatal care and the fact that the mother is gravida 2, para 1 (meaning this is her second pregnancy and she has one previous live birth) do not directly influence the type of twinning but are additional details about the mother's obstetric history.

Options A, C, and D involve monozygotic (identical) twins, which would not explain the significant differences in size and the presence of anomalies in one twin but not the other.

Her eyes are sunken, and her tongue appears dry. Which set of lab values would best correspond to this patient’s condition?",A,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest dehydration and possible metabolic alkalosis due to vomiting. The dehydration is indicated by her sunken eyes and dry tongue, and her orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing) is likely due to low blood volume. The cyclic vomiting has led to loss of gastric acid, which can cause a metabolic alkalosis.

In metabolic alkalosis, the pH is typically elevated (alkaline), and the bicarbonate (HCO3-) concentration is increased. The PCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide) may be increased or decreased, but in this case, we would expect it to be somewhat increased as the body compensates for the alkalosis by retaining CO2.

Looking at the options, we want to find the one that shows a pH that is alkaline (greater than 7.4), an increased HCO3- concentration, and a PCO2 that is not excessively high but shows some compensation.

Option A shows a pH of 7.5 (alkaline), a high HCO3- of 38 mEq/L (indicative of metabolic alkalosis), and a PCO2 of 50 mm Hg, which is elevated but not excessively so, indicating some respiratory compensation for the metabolic alkalosis. This is the most likely set of lab values for this patient.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic disorder characterized by dysfunction of the cilia, which are responsible for the movement of mucus and other substances out of the respiratory tract. This dysfunction can lead to recurrent respiratory infections, sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. Situs inversus, the mirror-image reversal of the thoracic and abdominal organs, is also a common feature of this syndrome.

The infertility in males with Kartagener syndrome is often due to the immotility of sperm, which is a result of the same ciliary dysfunction affecting the sperm's flagella. The cilia and sperm tails are both composed of microtubules, which are essential for their motility.

Given the options provided, the most likely class of proteins involved in this condition is:

A. Microtubule monomeric protein

This is because the dysfunction in the cilia and sperm tails is due to defects in the structure and function of microtubules, which are the main components of cilia and flagella. Mutations in genes encoding for proteins that are part of the microtubule structure or that regulate microtubule function can lead to primary ciliary dyskinesia, including Kartagener syndrome.",Success

Treatment with oral dicloxacillin is initiated. Four days later, the patient continues to have high-grade fever, pain, and purulent discharge. Which of the following characteristics of the infecting organism best explains the failure to improve with antibiotic therapy?",E,"The failure to improve with antibiotic therapy in this scenario is most likely due to the bacteria's ability to cleave β-lactam rings (Option C). Dicloxacillin is a β-lactam antibiotic, specifically a penicillin derivative. If the infecting organism has the ability to produce β-lactamase, an enzyme that cleaves the β-lactam ring of the antibiotic, it can inactivate the drug and become resistant to its effects. This is a common mechanism of resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive coccus that often forms clusters and is a common cause of surgical site infections.

The other options do not explain the lack of response to dicloxacillin as effectively:
A. Secretion of a pyrogenic toxin would explain the fever but not the lack of response to the antibiotic.
B. Gram-positive cocci do not have an impenetrable outer membrane like gram-negative bacteria do; they are generally more susceptible to antibiotics.
D. Development of efflux pumps could potentially contribute to antibiotic resistance, but this mechanism is less common in gram-positive cocci than in gram-negative bacteria.
E. Adaptation in binding proteins could refer to changes in penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which can lead to resistance, but this is less likely to explain the immediate failure of therapy compared to β-lactamase production.",Success
"A 45-year-old woman comes into your office with complaints of ""lump"" she found on her neck while showering. She denies any other symptoms and states that she has not gained any weight. On exam, you notice a 2 cm nodule on her anterior neck. Her TSH level is normal and radionucleotide scan reveals a cold nodule. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) reveals follicular architecture suspicious for malignancy. What is the next best step?",B,"The next best step in managing a patient with a neck nodule that is suspicious for malignancy on fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is:

B. Surgical excision

A cold nodule on a radionucleotide scan and suspicious cytology on FNAB are both concerning for malignancy, particularly in the context of a solitary thyroid nodule. Surgical excision is the most appropriate next step to obtain a definitive diagnosis and to manage the potential malignancy.",Success
"While in the ICU, a 62-year-old male undergoes placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter to evaluate his right heart pressures. All pressures are found to be within normal limits, and the cardiology fellow records a pulmonary wedge pressure of 10 mmHg. Which of the following are normal values for the pressures that will be obtained from this patient's right ventricle?",B,"The normal values for the pressures obtained from the right ventricle of a patient are typically around 25/10 mmHg. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A. 25/10 mmHg

This represents the systolic and diastolic pressures, respectively, within the right ventricle during a cardiac cycle. It is important to note that these values can vary based on the individual patient's condition and other factors, but 25/10 mmHg is considered within the normal range for right ventricular pressures.",Success
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. Over the past 8 months, his mother reports difficulty understanding the boy's speech. On occasion during this period, she has noticed that he does not respond when called by name and cannot follow 1-step instructions. He has a history of recurrent ear infections treated with antibiotics since birth. He is at the 60th percentile for length and 50th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. His speech is quiet and difficult to understand. Otoscopic examination shows retracted tympanic membranes bilaterally that are immobile on pneumatic otoscopy. Nasopharyngoscopy shows mild adenoid hypertrophy. Pure tone audiometry shows a conductive hearing loss of 26 dB on the right side and 28 dB on the left side. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The most appropriate next step in management for this 3-year-old boy with a history of recurrent ear infections, conductive hearing loss, and retracted tympanic membranes that are immobile on pneumatic otoscopy is:

C. Tympanostomy tube insertion

Tympanostomy tube insertion is indicated for children with recurrent acute otitis media, persistent otitis media with effusion, or hearing loss due to otitis media with effusion. The presence of conductive hearing loss and immobile tympanic membranes suggests the presence of middle ear effusion, which is not likely to resolve with medical therapy alone. Tympanostomy tubes can help to ventilate the middle ear space, allowing fluid to drain and improving hearing. Adenoidectomy might also be considered in cases of significant adenoid hypertrophy contributing to recurrent ear infections or hearing loss, but it is not the primary intervention for managing the current otitis media with effusion.",Success
"A 42-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit with decreased consciousness and convulsions. His wife reports that 30 min following the onset of her husband’s condition, which started approximately 6 hours ago, he treated his garden bed with pesticides against mice. He developed nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. The patient noted facial muscle twitching and developed a tonic-clonic seizure that lasted 3 minutes, 4 hours following the onset of his condition. His past medical history is insignificant for any seizure disorders, and he does not take any medications. His blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg, heart rate is 104/min, respiratory rate is 10/min, and the temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, the patient’s consciousness is decreased with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13. He is pale and sweaty. His lung sounds are normal, cardiac sounds are decreased, and no murmurs are present. Abdominal palpation reveals epigastric tenderness. Neurological examination shows rapid downbeating nystagmus, facial muscle twitching, and symmetrically decreased sensation to all the sensory modalities on both the upper and lower extremities. Further discussion reveals that the patient was using sodium fluoroacetate as a pesticide, which is known to form fluorocitrate in the cells of aerobic organisms. Which of the following substances will accumulate in the patient’s cells?",B,"The patient's symptoms and the use of sodium fluoroacetate as a pesticide suggest a case of poisoning by this compound. Sodium fluoroacetate is a rodenticide that, once ingested, is converted into fluorocitrate in the cells of aerobic organisms. Fluorocitrate is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme aconitase, which is a key component of the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle). Aconitase catalyzes the conversion of citrate to isocitrate, and its inhibition leads to an accumulation of citrate.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

B. Citrate

The accumulation of citrate in the cells disrupts the citric acid cycle, leading to a decrease in ATP production and a subsequent energy crisis in the cells. This can result in the symptoms described in the patient, including decreased consciousness, convulsions, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and facial muscle twitching.",Success
"A 72-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. 90 minutes ago, the patient was found by a neighbor unarousable on the couch with multiple empty bottles of medication on the floor next to her. Social history is significant for alcohol abuse. Physical examination reveals an awake female with a fluctuating level of consciousness, not oriented to time or place. No focal neurologic deficits. Which of the following additional findings would most likely be present in this patient?",A,"Given the scenario, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be:

A. Hallucinations

The patient's presentation is consistent with a drug overdose or acute intoxication, possibly exacerbated by alcohol abuse. Hallucinations can be a symptom of acute intoxication, especially in cases involving substances like alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other psychoactive drugs. The presence of multiple empty medication bottles suggests a potential overdose, which could lead to altered mental status and hallucinations.

However, it's important to note that without further information on the specific medications involved or the results of any toxicology screenings, this is an educated guess based on the information provided. Other options such as B (insidious course) and C (irreversibility) suggest a chronic condition, which is less likely given the acute presentation. Option D (multi-infarct dementia) is a type of dementia caused by multiple strokes and would not typically present with an acute onset of symptoms. Option E (normal vital signs) is not necessarily indicative of the patient's condition, as vital signs could be normal or abnormal depending on the specific substances involved and the patient's physiological response.",Success

He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has been treated with antibiotics and prednisolone for acute exacerbations three times in the past year. His medications include a fluticasone-salmeterol inhaler and a tiotropium bromide inhaler. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 48 years. His temperature is 39.1°C (103.1°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 88/69 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. Pulmonary examination shows diffuse crackles and rhonchi. An x-ray of the chest shows a left upper-lobe infiltrate of the lung. Two sets of blood cultures are obtained. Endotracheal aspirate Gram stain shows gram-negative rods. Two large bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluids are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",D,"The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be option D: Cefepime and levofloxacin. This combination is chosen due to the patient's clinical presentation, which suggests a severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with possible healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) due to his recent hospitalization and chemotherapy. The presence of gram-negative rods in the Gram stain further supports the use of antibiotics effective against gram-negative bacteria.

Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common pathogen in HCAP. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is also effective against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including atypical pathogens like Mycoplasma and Legionella, which can cause CAP.

The other options are less suitable:
A. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin: This is a common combination for CAP, but ceftriaxone may not be as effective against Pseudomonas, and azithromycin does not provide significant additional coverage against gram-negative bacteria.
B. Ertapenem: This carbapenem has good activity against gram-negative bacteria but poor coverage against Pseudomonas and may not be as effective as cefepime.
C. Colistin: This antibiotic is usually reserved for multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria and is not typically used as a first-line treatment for pneumonia.
E. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate: This combination is effective against atypical bacteria and some gram-positive bacteria but does not provide adequate coverage for gram-negative pathogens that are likely in this patient's case.",Success

Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",B,"The next best step in the management of this patient is Option B: Discontinue methimazole, start propylthiouracil.

Methimazole is a first-line treatment for hyperthyroidism, but during pregnancy, it is recommended to switch to propylthiouracil (PTU) due to concerns about the potential teratogenic effects of methimazole. PTU is considered safer in the first trimester of pregnancy because it has a lower placental transfer rate compared to methimazole. However, it is important to note that PTU may be associated with a higher risk of liver toxicity and should be used with caution and close monitoring. After the first trimester, some clinicians may switch back to methimazole due to its better control of hyperthyroidism and lower risk of liver toxicity.

Giardia lamblia is a protozoan parasite that causes diarrhea and malabsorption. The patient's history of recurrent episodes of foul-smelling greasy diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and failure to thrive are typical of this condition. However, the question asks about the increased risk for the patient, not the diagnosis.

None of the options listed are directly associated with Giardiasis. However, if we have to choose the most likely increased risk based on the given information, option D, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, might be the best choice, but not because of the Giardiasis. Chronic malnutrition and immune system dysregulation, which can result from chronic diarrhea and malabsorption, may increase the risk for certain malignancies, including Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, it is important to note that the direct link between Giardiasis and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is not well-established, and this option is speculative given the information provided.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the diagnosis of Giardiasis:

A. Progressive peripheral neuropathy is not typically associated with Giardiasis.
B. Anaphylactic transfusion reactions are not related to the patient's symptoms or the diagnosis.

Which of the following histopathologic findings is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?",D,"The clinical presentation of the 8-year-old boy, including the rash, recent sore throat, and a holosystolic murmur, suggests a diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). ARF is an inflammatory disease that can develop after a group A streptococcal infection, such as streptococcal pharyngitis. The rash described, pink rings on the torso and inner surfaces of the limbs, is consistent with erythema marginatum, a characteristic rash of ARF. The holosystolic murmur is likely due to mitral valve involvement, which is a common cardiac manifestation of ARF.

This condition typically occurs when a newborn is exposed to certain substances in utero and then experiences withdrawal symptoms after birth. Among the options provided, the most likely cause of these symptoms is the maternal use of a mu receptor agonist (Option B).

A photograph of the peripheral blood smear is shown. Blood and urine cultures are negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?""",C,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is B. Dengue hemorrhagic fever. The patient's recent travel history to Sri Lanka, where dengue fever is endemic, along with her symptoms of fever, headache, nausea, and abdominal discomfort, and signs of petechiae and bleeding gums, suggest a hemorrhagic disorder. The laboratory findings of thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), anemia, elevated liver enzymes (LDH), and positive stool for occult blood further support this diagnosis. The presence of hemoconcentration, which is not mentioned but could be inferred from the high hematocrit that is not reported but often seen in dengue fever due to plasma leakage, would also be consistent with dengue hemorrhagic fever.

The peripheral blood smear would likely show evidence of red cell fragmentation, which can occur in dengue hemorrhagic fever, although it is not specific to this diagnosis and can also be seen in other conditions such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). However, the negative Coomb's test rules out autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and the normal INR and negative fibrin split products make disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) less likely. The absence of severe neurological symptoms and the relatively normal blood pressure argue against a diagnosis of HELLP syndrome, which typically presents with hypertension and proteinuria in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. The patient's liver enzymes are not markedly elevated, which also argues against HELLP syndrome.

The mild elevation in creatinine and presence of protein and red blood cells in the urine could suggest renal involvement, which can occur in severe dengue, but the absence of significant hematuria and the relatively normal creatinine level make hemolytic uremic syndrome less likely. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) would be expected to present with more severe neurological symptoms and a higher lactate dehydrogenase level, and the lack of renal failure and the presence of a normal INR make this diagnosis less likely as well.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is dengue hemorrhagic fever.",Success

Two large-bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. The patient is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"Based on the patient's presentation and the initial findings, the most appropriate next step in management would be:

B. CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis

The patient has a gunshot wound to the chest with mild opacification of the right lower lobe on chest x-ray, which suggests possible lung injury. Additionally, the patient has diffuse mild tenderness on abdominal examination, which could indicate abdominal injury. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis can provide detailed information about the extent of the injuries and guide further management, including the need for surgical intervention.

While chest tube insertion (option A) might be necessary if there is a hemothorax or pneumothorax, the chest x-ray does not show any obvious indication for this procedure at this time. Local wound exploration (option C) and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (option E) are more invasive and would typically be considered after a thorough assessment, including imaging, to determine the necessity and extent of such interventions.

"Mutations in the ATP2A1 gene results in loss of function of the calcium ATPase pump, which is in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes of skeletal muscle in humans. This mutation results in a rare disease characterized by muscle cramping and stiffening that is usually most severe after exercise or strenuous activity and is typically relieved after affected individuals rest for a few minutes. Which of the following is expected in individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation?",B,"The correct answer is B. Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased.

Explanation: The ATP2A1 gene encodes the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 1 (SERCA1) pump, which is responsible for transporting calcium ions from the cytosol back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum during muscle relaxation. This process is crucial for muscle relaxation because it lowers the cytosolic calcium concentration, which allows the muscle to relax after contraction. In individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation, the SERCA1 pump does not function properly, leading to a reduced ability to pump calcium ions back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. As a result, the cytosolic calcium concentration remains elevated, which prolongs muscle contraction and increases muscle relaxation time. Therefore, in individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation, we expect to see an increased muscle relaxation time and an increased cytosolic calcium concentration.",Success
"A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with crushing chest pain (10/10 in severity), radiating to the left side of the neck and the left arm. His symptoms started 20 minutes ago while shaving. He also feels nauseated, lightheaded and short of breath. He has had type 2 diabetes for 27 years and essential hypertension for 19 years. He has smoked 20–30 cigarettes per day for the past 35 years. Family history is irrelevant. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), the blood pressure is 115/72 mm Hg and the pulse is 107/min.

The patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain, nausea, bilious vomiting, and the absence of bowel movements and flatus, along with the abdominal examination findings of distension and high-pitched bowel sounds, suggest a possible mechanical obstruction. The presence of laparoscopic scars and a history of appendectomy increase the likelihood of adhesions, which are common post-surgical complications that can lead to bowel obstruction.

E. Continuous mucosal damage

Ulcerative colitis is characterized by continuous inflammation of the colonic mucosa that typically begins in the rectum and extends proximally in a continuous fashion. Involvement of the terminal ileum (Option A) is more suggestive of Crohn's disease, as is the presence of noncaseating granulomas (Option C) and transmural inflammation (Option D). The absence of rectal involvement (Option B) is also not typical of ulcerative colitis, as the rectum is almost always involved in this condition.",Success

B-cell maturation. The symptoms described, including difficulty breathing, bluish discoloration of the lips, poor weight gain, and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, along with the laboratory findings of decreased serum IgA, IgE, and IgG titers, suggest a primary immunodeficiency disorder. The presence of disc-shaped cysts in bronchial lavage fluid, which are likely Pneumocystis jirovecii cysts, indicates a severe immunodeficiency. A defect in B-cell maturation would result in decreased antibody production, leading to recurrent infections and the clinical presentation described.",Success
"A 67-year-old man comes to the clinic complaining of fatigue and dizziness for the past 2 months. He reports that he gets tired easily compared to his baseline and feels dizzy when he exerts himself (e.g., when he walks long distances). His past medical history is significant for hypertension that is controlled with lisinopril. A physical examination demonstrates moderate hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy. His laboratory studies are shown below.

A subsequent flow cytometry test demonstrates CD20+ cells. What is the most likely finding you would expect in this patient?",E,"The most likely finding in this patient, given the clinical presentation and laboratory results, is the presence of smudge cells (Option E). Smudge cells are often seen in peripheral blood smears of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is a type of cancer characterized by the overproduction of mature lymphocytes, particularly B-lymphocytes. The presence of CD20+ cells on flow cytometry is consistent with a B-cell malignancy, and CLL is a common B-cell malignancy in older adults.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue and dizziness, along with the physical examination findings of hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy, are also consistent with CLL. The laboratory results show a leukocytosis with a predominance of lymphocytes (50% of the differential), which is typical in CLL. The mild anemia (hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count 120,000/mm^3) can also be seen in CLL due to bone marrow infiltration by leukemic cells.

The other options are not as likely:
A. Low levels of erythropoietin are not a typical finding in CLL. In fact, erythropoietin levels may be normal or elevated in response to anemia.
B. Low levels of leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) are seen in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), not CLL.
C. Myeloperoxidase positive cytoplasmic inclusions are seen in myeloid cells, not in lymphocytes as in CLL.

"A 81-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he fell asleep at the dinner table and was not able to be roused by his family. His past medical history is significant for Alzheimer disease though he is still relatively functional at baseline. He has also been taking warfarin over the last 3 months after he suffered a deep venous thrombosis. After he was transported to the ED, his family found that the pills his grandson takes for seizures were missing. On presentation, he is found to be somnolent and physical exam reveals ataxia and nystagmus. After determining the cause of this patient's symptoms, his physicians begin monitoring his international normalized ratio, because they are concerned that it will start trending down. Which of the following treatments would most improve the urinary excretion of the substance likely responsible for these symptoms?",D,"The symptoms described in the patient are indicative of a benzodiazepine overdose. Benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat seizures and can cause ataxia, nystagmus, and somnolence. The fact that the patient's grandson's pills for seizures were missing points to this as the likely cause of the symptoms.

To improve the urinary excretion of benzodiazepines, which are weak acids, one would want to alkalinize the urine to promote renal excretion. Sodium bicarbonate (Option D) is used to alkalinize the urine, which would facilitate the excretion of the benzodiazepines by making them less reabsorbable in the renal tubules.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D. Sodium bicarbonate**.

Regarding the concern about the international normalized ratio (INR) trending down, this is likely due to the potential interaction between warfarin and benzodiazepines. Certain benzodiazepines can inhibit the metabolism of warfarin, potentially leading to an increased INR. However, once the benzodiazepine is no longer in the system, the metabolism of warfarin may resume at a faster rate, leading to a decrease in INR. This is an important consideration in the management of this patient, as it may necessitate adjustments in warfarin dosing to prevent bleeding complications.",Success

Swelling of the left inguinal area was noted; however, there were no skin changes. Several large, tense, and tender lymph nodes with a boggy consistency were palpated in the inguinal region. The right inguinal area is normal on physical exam. There was no lymphadenopathy in other areas. No abnormalities existed in the lungs, heart, and abdomen. Microscopic examination of pus from the inguinal lymph nodes revealed gram-negative Coccobacilli. Serum anti-F1 titers show a 4-fold rise.

The anti-F1 titers are specific for the F1 (fraction 1) capsular antigen of Y. pestis, which is indicative of plague infection.

For the treatment of plague, the CDC recommends aminoglycosides (such as streptomycin) or tetracyclines as first-line therapy. Among the options provided, streptomycin (Option D) is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time.

Azithromycin (Option A) and chloramphenicol (Option C) can also be effective against Y. pestis but are not the first-line therapy recommended by the CDC. Imipenem (Option B) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic and is not specifically indicated for the treatment of plague.

Her temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 115/min and regular, and blood pressure is 155/85 mm Hg. Examination shows decreased muscle strength on the entire right side. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ on the right. Babinski sign is present on the right. The left lower leg is swollen, erythematous, and tender to palpation. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following?",A,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible stroke, given her sudden weakness in her right arm and leg. The fact that she has a swollen, erythematous, and tender left lower leg is indicative of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVTs can lead to pulmonary embolisms, but they can also cause a paradoxical embolism if there is an interatrial communication such as a patent foramen ovale (PFO). This would allow a clot from the venous system to pass directly to the arterial system without going through the lungs.

However, the question asks for the most likely finding on further evaluation, and while a PFO could contribute to her symptoms, it is not the most likely finding given her other symptoms and history. The presence of a DVT in the context of her symptoms suggests that the embolus from the DVT has likely traveled to her brain, causing a stroke. This is more likely than the other options listed.

The other options (atrial myxoma, mitral valve vegetation, atrial fibrillation, and carotid artery dissection) could also lead to stroke, but they do not have the same direct link to the DVT in her leg. Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of stroke due to the formation of clots in the atria that can embolize to the brain, but there is no indication of atrial fibrillation in the patient's history or examination. Atrial myxoma and mitral valve vegetation are rare causes of stroke and would not be the first conditions to suspect based on the given information. Carotid artery dissection can cause stroke, but it does not explain the DVT in the leg.

Given the information provided, the most likely finding on further evaluation would be evidence of a stroke caused by an embolus from the DVT in her leg, potentially facilitated by a patent foramen ovale. However, among the provided options, the patent foramen ovale (Option A) is the only one that directly relates to the mechanism of paradoxical embolism from a DVT to the brain.

Therefore, the answer is:
A. Patent foramen ovale",Success

The patient is immediately started on a bolus of intravenous (IV) 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl). Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",D,"The patient's presentation and laboratory results are consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of diabetes that requires immediate medical attention. In DKA, high blood glucose levels lead to the production of ketones, which can cause acidosis and dehydration. The patient's blood glucose level is very high (630 mg/dL), her pH is low (7.1), and her bicarbonate (HCO3) level is low (8 mEq/L), indicating metabolic acidosis. The presence of ketones in the urine further supports the diagnosis of DKA.

The first step in managing DKA is to administer intravenous fluids to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. The patient is already receiving a bolus of IV 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl), which is appropriate for initial rehydration.

The next best step in the management of this patient is to start an IV insulin infusion (Option C). Insulin therapy is crucial in DKA to lower blood glucose levels, stop ketone production, and correct acidosis. It is important to closely monitor the patient's glucose levels and adjust the insulin dose accordingly to avoid hypoglycemia.

Options A, B, D, and E are not the next best steps at this point:

A. Infuse NaHCO3 slowly: Although the patient has metabolic acidosis, bicarbonate therapy is not typically recommended in the initial management of DKA. Insulin therapy and fluid replacement are usually sufficient to correct the acidosis. Bicarbonate may be considered in severe acidosis (pH < 7.1) if there are signs of poor perfusion or if the patient is intubated, but it is not the first-line treatment.

B. Switch fluids to 0.45% NaCl: The patient is likely dehydrated and requires isotonic fluids such as 0.9% NaCl to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Hypotonic fluids (0.45% NaCl) may lead to further electrolyte imbalances and should not be used initially in the management of DKA.

D. Replace potassium intravenously: Potassium replacement is important in DKA, as insulin therapy can drive potassium into cells, potentially leading to hypokalemia. However, the patient's potassium level is currently low (3.1 mEq/L), and potassium replacement should be initiated after insulin therapy has been started and glucose levels are beginning to normalize. It is not the next best step before starting insulin therapy.

E. Start IV 5% dextrose: This is not appropriate as it would further increase the patient's blood glucose levels and exacerbate DKA. Dextrose should only be added to the IV fluids once the blood glucose level has been lowered to a safer range (usually below 250 mg/dL) to prevent hypoglycemia during insulin therapy.",Success

The presence of shortness of breath on exertion and while lying down (orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea), swelling of the feet (pedal edema), and bilateral crackles heard loudest at the lung bases are all indicative of pulmonary congestion and fluid overload. The patient's history of hypertension and lack of treatment for it likely contributed to the development of heart failure.

In heart failure, the heart may not pump blood as efficiently as it should, leading to a backup of blood in the lungs and other parts of the body. This can result in the formation of an S3 gallop. An S3 gallop is an extra heart sound that occurs due to the rapid filling of the ventricles and is often heard in cases of heart failure, particularly left ventricular failure. It is usually heard best at the left sternal border and is more prominent when the patient is in the left lateral decubitus position.

""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

The question asks which cells were most likely damaged first, and given the context of severe liver enzyme elevation, the answer is likely to be related to hepatocyte damage.

The options given are:
A. Hepatic stellate (Ito) cells
B. Periportal hepatocytes
C. Hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells
D. Hepatic Kupffer cells
E. Centrilobular hepatocytes

Among these, periportal hepatocytes (option B) and centrilobular hepatocytes (option E) are the most relevant to consider, as these are the two main types of hepatocytes in the liver. Periportal hepatocytes are located near the portal triad and are the first to receive blood from the portal vein, while centrilobular hepatocytes are located near the central vein and are the last to receive blood. 

In the context of liver injury, the pattern of damage can vary depending on the type of insult. For example, centrilobular necrosis is typically seen with toxins that are metabolized by the liver and cause damage to cells that have received the most metabolically altered blood, such as in acetaminophen (paracetamol) overdose. Periportal necrosis can be seen in conditions like ischemic injury, where the outer parts of the liver lobule are more susceptible due to their distance from the central vein.

However, in the given scenario, there is no specific information to suggest that the liver damage is due to a particular toxin or ischemic injury. Given the systemic nature of the patient's presentation (diverticular bleeding leading to hypotension and shock), it is possible that the initial damage could be due to hypoperfusion and subsequent reperfusion injury, which could affect both periportal and centrilobular hepatocytes.

Without more specific information about the cause of liver damage, it is difficult to definitively choose between periportal and centrilobular hepatocytes. However, in the context of acute liver injury with no clear indication of a specific cause, periportal hepatocytes (option B) might be considered more likely to be damaged first due to their location and exposure to potentially toxic substances early in the portal circulation.

Therefore, the answer that best fits the given information is:
B. Periportal hepatocytes",Success
"A 32-year-old man is brought by ambulance to the emergency room after being involved in a head-on motor vehicle collision at high speed. The patient was found unconscious by the paramedics and regained consciousness briefly during the ambulance ride. Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient’s vitals show: pulse 110/min, respiratory rate 12/min, blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination reveals an unresponsive man with multiple bruises across the chest and along the upper arms with a laceration on the forehead. His is unresponsive to verbal commands and physical touch. His GCS is 6/15. The right pupil is fixed and dilated. An urgent noncontrast CT of the head is performed and shown in the image. The patient is prepared for emergency neurosurgery. Which of the following anesthesia medications would be the best option for this patient?",A,"In this scenario, the patient has sustained a significant head injury with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 6/15, indicating severe impairment of consciousness. The fixed and dilated right pupil suggests an intracranial injury with potential herniation, which is confirmed by the urgent noncontrast CT of the head. The patient is being prepared for emergency neurosurgery.

When considering anesthesia for a patient with a head injury, it is important to choose medications that minimize cerebral metabolic rate (CMR), intracranial pressure (ICP), and cerebral blood volume (CBV) while maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). The goal is to prevent further brain injury during the surgical intervention.

Among the options provided, Propofol (Option A) is the best choice for this patient. Propofol is a short-acting sedative-hypnotic that is commonly used in anesthesia for its favorable effects on the brain. It decreases CMR, ICP, and CBV, which are critical in patients with head injuries. Propofol also has a rapid onset and short duration of action, making it ideal for rapid sequence induction and maintenance of anesthesia in emergency situations.

Halothane (Option B) is no longer commonly used due to its potential for causing cardiac arrhythmias and liver toxicity. Midazolam (Option C) is a benzodiazepine that can be used for sedation but is not typically used as the primary anesthetic agent in this setting. Nitrous oxide (Option D) can increase ICP and is generally avoided in patients with head injuries. Sevoflurane (Option E) is a volatile anesthetic that can be used in neurosurgery, but it may not have the same favorable effects on ICP and CMR as propofol.

Therefore, the best option for this patient is Propofol (Option A).",Success
"A 25-year-old female presents to urgent care with complaints of one day of burning and pain with urination, urgency, and frequency. She denies having a fever but has experienced intermittent chills. She is sexually active and inconsistently uses condoms. The patient has no past medical history. She is allergic to sulfa drugs. Physical examination of the genitalia is normal. Urinalysis shows positive leukocyte esterase and nitrites. The urine culture demonstrates gram-negative rods that form pink colonies on MacConkey agar. She is treated with an antibiotic and her symptoms quickly improve. The mechanism of the antibiotic she was most likely treated with is which of the following?",A,"The antibiotic that the patient was most likely treated with is one that inhibits cell wall synthesis (Option A). The description of the case suggests that the patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by gram-negative rods, which are likely E. coli, the most common cause of UTIs. The antibiotic that would be effective against E. coli and does not contain sulfa (due to her allergy) would likely be a beta-lactam antibiotic such as amoxicillin, a cephalosporin, or a carbapenem, all of which inhibit cell wall synthesis. However, in an urgent care setting, a fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin might be used, which inhibits DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, but this mechanism is not listed among the options provided. Therefore, the most likely answer based on the options given is A, which describes the mechanism of beta-lactam antibiotics.",Success
"A 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation comes to the physician for shortness of breath with mild exertion, progressive weakness, and a dry cough that has persisted for 6 months. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 45 years. His medications include warfarin, enalapril, and amiodarone. His pulse is 85/min and irregularly irregular. Physical examination shows enlarged fingertips and markedly curved nails. A CT scan of the chest shows clustered air spaces and reticular opacities in the basal parts of the lung. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's dyspnea?",E,"The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's dyspnea is E. Excess collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix of the lung. The patient's history, symptoms, and physical examination findings, along with the CT scan results, suggest a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is characterized by progressive scarring and thickening of the lung tissue, which leads to decreased lung function and shortness of breath, especially with exertion. The enlarged fingertips and markedly curved nails, known as clubbing, are also common in patients with IPF. The CT scan findings of clustered air spaces and reticular opacities in the basal parts of the lung are consistent with the typical pattern seen in IPF.",Success
"A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his mother after being found lying unconscious next to a bottle of pills. The patient’s mother mentions that he has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder 3 years ago for which he was taking a medication that resulted in only a slight improvement in his symptoms. She says he still found it difficult to concentrate on his studies and did not participate in any social events in college. He didn’t have many friends and was often found sitting alone in his room. He has also threatened to take his life on several occasions, but she did not think he was serious. While recording his vital signs, the patient goes into a coma. His ECG shows a QT interval of 450 milliseconds. Which of the following medications did this patient most likely overdose on?",E,"The patient's symptoms and the ECG findings suggest an overdose of a medication that can prolong the QT interval, which can lead to serious cardiac arrhythmias. Among the options given, Clomipramine (E) is a tricyclic antidepressant that is known to cause significant QT prolongation and is associated with a higher risk of overdose, including cardiac complications.

Bupropion (A), Sertraline (B), Venlafaxine (C), and Citalopram (D) are less likely to cause such severe QT prolongation, especially not to the extent that would result in a coma and cardiac complications as described. While Citalopram can prolong the QT interval, Clomipramine is more notorious for causing severe cardiac side effects in overdose situations.

Therefore, the answer is E. Clomipramine.",Success
"In a study to determine the risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age (age < 30 years), 30 young patients with the condition are recruited into the study group. Sixty similar but healthy individuals are recruited into the control group. Educational status is considered to be an important variable, as it would affect the awareness of the disease and its risk factors among the participants. Based on the level of education, 2 groups are formed: low educational status and high educational status. A chi-square test is performed to test the significance of the relationship, and an odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9–9.7. What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?",A,"The correct answer is A. The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.

The odds ratio (OR) of 2.1 indicates that individuals with low educational status have 2.1 times the odds of having a myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age compared to those with high educational status. However, the confidence interval (CI) for this odds ratio is quite wide, ranging from 0.9 to 9.7. A confidence interval that includes 1 (as this one does) indicates that the association could be due to chance. In other words, the observed association between low education and young age MI could be due to random variation, and the results are not statistically significant. Therefore, we cannot conclude that low education is a risk factor for MI in young individuals based on this study.",Success
"A 32-year-old primigravid woman at 16 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal visit. She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F) and blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 16-week gestation. A quadruple screening test shows maternal serum AFP of 3 times the median and normal levels of serum β-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A. Which of the following is most likely to account for these findings?",C,"The most likely explanation for the findings of an elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, with normal levels of serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG), estriol, and inhibin A, in a 16-week pregnant woman is:

C. Neural tube defect

Elevated AFP levels can indicate a number of conditions, but in the context of normal levels of the other markers, a neural tube defect is the most common cause. Neural tube defects, such as spina bifida or anencephaly, often result in leakage of AFP into the amniotic fluid, which can then cross the placenta into the maternal circulation, leading to elevated AFP levels in the mother's serum.

Options A (fetal hydrocephalus) and B (partial molar pregnancy) are less likely to cause an isolated elevation in AFP without affecting the other markers. Options D (Trisomy 18) and E (Trisomy 21) are typically associated with lower than normal AFP levels and are not usually the cause of an elevated AFP level.",Success

His physical examination shows minimal bibasilar rales, but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, normal heart sounds, and a benign abdominal physical examination. Which of the following is the most reasonable 1st step towards ruling out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient?",C,"The most reasonable first step towards ruling out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) in a low-risk patient is to perform a D-dimer test (Option C). A D-dimer test measures the level of a protein fragment that is produced when a blood clot dissolves in the body. Elevated D-dimer levels can indicate the presence of a clot, but they are not specific to PE and can be elevated in other conditions as well. However, in a low-risk patient, a negative D-dimer test can effectively rule out PE, avoiding the need for further, more invasive and costly imaging studies. If the D-dimer is negative, it is unlikely that the patient has a pulmonary embolism, and further testing may not be necessary. If the D-dimer is positive, further imaging such as a CT pulmonary angiogram may be indicated to confirm or rule out PE.",Success
"A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of her right hand. Specifically, she says that she was gardening 8 hours prior to presentation when she sustained a laceration over her distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. Since then, they have become red and swollen. She has also had pain in her proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints for several years and reports that this pain is worse in the morning but improves over the day. The cells that are present in this patient's DIP joints and PIP joints are analyzed and compared. Which of the following is most likely to be true about this patient's findings?",C,"The patient's history of pain in her PIP and MCP joints for several years, which is worse in the morning and improves over the day, is suggestive of inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The recent laceration over her DIP joints that has become red and swollen is likely due to acute inflammation secondary to trauma or infection. 

In the context of chronic inflammatory arthritis, the PIP joints would be expected to have more chronic inflammatory cells, such as monocytes/macrophages, whereas the DIP joints would have more acute inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, due to the recent trauma. Therefore, the most likely answer is:

C. DIP has more neutrophils and fewer monocytes than PIP

However, it is important to note that without further diagnostic testing, such as joint aspiration and analysis of synovial fluid, it is difficult to definitively determine the exact composition of the cells present in the patient's joints.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a severe headache. She states it is 10/10 in intensity and states that it is associated with chewing.

The patient's symptoms of severe headache, specifically worsened by chewing, and the physical exam findings of pain and tenderness over the mandibular and temporal region that is exacerbated by mouth movement are consistent with TMJ dysfunction. This condition can cause significant pain and is often related to issues with the jaw joint and surrounding muscles.

A. Migraine headache typically does not have the association with jaw movement that this patient describes.

This condition is characterized by decreased levels of insulin, a hormone that regulates glucose uptake and metabolism. In the context of DKA, the lack of insulin leads to several metabolic derangements, including:

A. Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes - This is correct. Insulin is required for glucose uptake by adipocytes and muscle cells, and its deficiency leads to decreased glucose uptake by these tissues.

B. Decreased activity of hormone-sensitive lipase - This is incorrect. In the absence of insulin, hormone-sensitive lipase is activated, leading to increased lipolysis and the release of free fatty acids.

C. Decreased proteolysis - This is incorrect. Insulin deficiency leads to increased proteolysis as the body breaks down proteins to provide energy in the absence of glucose.

D. Increased lipoprotein lipase activity - This is incorrect. Insulin normally stimulates lipoprotein lipase activity, which is decreased in the absence of insulin.

E. Decreased glucose uptake by brain cells - This is incorrect. Brain cells do not require insulin for glucose uptake; they can take up glucose via facilitated diffusion through glucose transporters.

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely metabolic change you would expect to see in this patient is A. Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes. This is due to the lack of insulin, which is necessary for glucose uptake in adipocytes and muscle cells.",Success

- Persistent concern or worry about having additional attacks
- Significant maladaptive changes in behavior related to the attacks

None of the options provided directly confirm the diagnosis of panic disorder according to the DSM-5 criteria. However, options A and B are related to the frequency and duration of symptoms, which are important for the diagnosis. Option C is also relevant as it pertains to the duration of the panic attacks. Option D, family history, could be relevant if there is a history of anxiety disorders in the family, but it is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Option E, agoraphobia, is a separate diagnosis that can sometimes co-occur with panic disorder but is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis of panic disorder.

Therefore, the most relevant options to confirm the diagnosis of panic disorder in this patient would be A, B, and C, as they pertain to the frequency, duration, and persistence of symptoms. However, the specific number of attacks or duration of symptoms required for a diagnosis would need to be assessed through further evaluation and history taking. 

In this case, the most appropriate next step would be to conduct a thorough psychiatric evaluation to assess for the presence of panic disorder and any other possible co-morbid conditions.

"A previously healthy 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of generalized malaise and a palpable swelling in the left axilla. The parents report that 2 weeks ago, his daycare group visited an animal shelter, after which he developed a rash on the left hand. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F). Physical examination shows three linear crusts on an erythematous background on the dorsum of the left hand. There is tender left-sided axillary and cervical lymphadenopathy. Histopathologic examination of an axillary lymph node shows necrotizing granulomas. The most likely causal organism of this patient's clinical findings is also involved in the pathogenesis of which of the following conditions?",A,"The clinical presentation of the 6-year-old boy, including the history of contact with animals, the development of a rash followed by lymphadenopathy, and the histopathologic finding of necrotizing granulomas, is most consistent with a diagnosis of cat scratch disease (CSD). The most common causative organism for CSD is Bartonella henselae, which is transmitted to humans through the bites or scratches of cats, particularly kittens.

Among the options given, the condition most closely related to the pathogenesis of the organism causing the patient's symptoms is not directly listed. However, Bartonella species, including B. henselae, are also involved in the pathogenesis of bacillary angiomatosis (Option A). Bacillary angiomatosis is a cutaneous condition characterized by the development of red or purple papules and nodules, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. It is caused by Bartonella henselae and Bartonella quintana.

A. Bacillary angiomatosis",Success
"A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with severe dyspnea and a productive cough containing streaks of blood since the day before. He had a sudden pruritic papular rash on his right thigh when he was in the southwestern USA hiking in northern Arizona and New Mexico. The next day he developed severely painful inguinal swelling on the same side; however, he did not see a physician and controlled the pain with painkillers. There is no other history of serious illness. He does not take any other medications. He appears confused. The temperature is 39.5℃ (103.1℉), the pulse is 105/min, the respiration rate is 32/min, and the blood pressure is 95/45 mm Hg. Rales are heard in the lower lobe of the left lung on auscultation. The right inguinal lymph nodes are enlarged with a spongy consistency and an underlying hard core. The surrounding area is edematous without overlying erythema or cellulitis. A computerized tomography (CT) scan is shown in the picture. Which of the following best explains these findings?",C,"The correct answer is C. Plague.

The patient's symptoms and clinical presentation are consistent with plague, which is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The patient's history of hiking in the southwestern USA, where plague is endemic, and the development of a pruritic papular rash followed by painful inguinal lymphadenopathy (buboes) are characteristic of bubonic plague. The presence of fever, dyspnea, and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) suggest the development of pneumonic plague, which can occur as a complication of bubonic plague. The confusion and hypotension may indicate septic shock, which can occur in severe cases of plague. The CT scan may show evidence of pneumonia or lung involvement, which is consistent with pneumonic plague. 

Lyme disease (option A) typically presents with a characteristic erythematous rash (erythema migrans) and flu-like symptoms, but does not usually cause severe respiratory symptoms or buboes. Malaria (option B) is a parasitic infection transmitted by mosquitoes that typically presents with fever, chills, and anemia, but does not usually cause respiratory symptoms or buboes. Tick typhus (option D) is a rickettsial infection transmitted by ticks that typically presents with fever, headache, and a maculopapular rash, but does not usually cause respiratory symptoms or buboes. Legionnaire's disease (option E) is a bacterial infection that can cause severe pneumonia, but does not usually cause buboes or a pruritic papular rash.",Success

Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Three 2-3 mm, dome-shaped, hardened papules are noted on the left thigh. Central umbilication can be observed in each papule. There is a non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy present. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The most likely diagnosis for the patient with the described symptoms is C. Molluscum contagiosum. The description of the lesions as dome-shaped, hardened papules with central umbilication on the left thigh is characteristic of this viral infection. The patient's history of intravenous drug use may also suggest an immunocompromised state, which can make him more susceptible to viral infections like molluscum contagiosum. The other options do not fit the description of the lesions or the patient's history as well. Kaposi sarcoma typically presents as purple or brownish-red patches or nodules on the skin and is more common in immunocompromised individuals, but the description of the lesions does not match.

"A 55-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a general checkup. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation and is currently taking warfarin, insulin, lisinopril, and metoprolol. The patient’s brother recently died from a heart attack and he has switched to an all vegetarian diet in order to improve his health. His temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 167/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient’s physical exam is unremarkable. His laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Hemoglobin: 12 g/dL
Hematocrit: 36%
Leukocyte count: 7,550/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 197,000/mm^3
INR: 1.0

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best explanation for this patient’s laboratory values?",A,"The patient's laboratory values do not indicate any immediate abnormalities that would suggest a specific issue related to his dietary changes, increased hepatic metabolism, increased renal clearance, or medication noncompliance. However, given the context and the options provided, we can analyze each possibility:

A. **Dietary changes**: The patient has recently switched to an all-vegetarian diet. While dietary changes can influence certain lab values over time, such as cholesterol levels, the current lab values do not show any immediate effects that could be attributed solely to this change. The glucose level is within normal range (99 mg/dL), which is a positive sign given his diabetes, but it's not unusual for someone who is on insulin and managing their diet.

B. **Increased hepatic metabolism**: This could potentially affect the INR levels if the patient's liver is metabolizing the warfarin more efficiently, but the INR is 1.0, which is below the therapeutic range for someone on warfarin for atrial fibrillation (typically 2.0-3.0). This could suggest that the warfarin dose might need adjustment, but it does not necessarily indicate increased hepatic metabolism without further liver function test results.

C. **Increased renal clearance**: The patient's creatinine level (1.1 mg/dL) is within the normal range, and his BUN is also normal (20 mg/dL). These values do not suggest increased renal clearance that would significantly alter the lab results.

D. **Laboratory error**: While possible, there is no specific indication in the provided lab results that would suggest a laboratory error. All values are within normal ranges or expected for someone with his medical history and medication regimen.

E. **Medication noncompliance**: This could potentially explain the low INR if the patient is not taking his warfarin as prescribed. However, without further information on his medication adherence, it's difficult to conclude this based on the lab results alone.

Given the options and the context, the most likely explanation that would require immediate attention is **E. Medication noncompliance**, specifically regarding the warfarin, due to the low INR value. The patient's blood pressure is also high, which might suggest noncompliance with his antihypertensive medication (lisinopril and metoprolol), but this is not directly related to the lab values provided.

However, it's important to note that a single low INR value might not necessarily indicate noncompliance; it could be due to other factors such as dietary vitamin K intake or other medications that affect warfarin metabolism. Further investigation, including a discussion with the patient about his medication adherence and recent dietary habits, would be necessary to determine the cause of the low INR.",Success
"A 20-year-old woman in the army recruit collapses during an especially hot day at basic training. She was in her normal excellent state of health prior to this event.

At the hospital, her temperature is 40.3°C (104.5°F), blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical exam, the patient appears to have altered mental status and her skin is dry, hot, and erythematous. She is complaining of severe bilateral flank pain and generalized myalgia. Catheterization produces 200 mL of tea-colored urine. Urine dipstick is positive for blood, but urinalysis is negative for RBCs or WBCs. Which of the following is most likely responsible for her condition?",D,"The most likely diagnosis for this patient is D. Heat stroke. The patient's symptoms and the circumstances of her collapse during a hot day at basic training, along with her high temperature, altered mental status, dry and hot skin, and tea-colored urine, are all consistent with heat stroke. The bilateral flank pain and generalized myalgia, along with the tea-colored urine, suggest possible rhabdomyolysis, a condition often associated with heat stroke due to muscle breakdown. The absence of red blood cells (RBCs) or white blood cells (WBCs) in the urinalysis, despite a positive urine dipstick for blood, also supports this diagnosis over options involving kidney pathology.

While the patient's father's medical history could suggest a genetic predisposition to kidney disease, there is no immediate evidence from the patient's presentation to suggest a specific genetic condition like Alport syndrome (option A) or IgA nephropathy (option E). Similarly, Neisseria meningitides (option B) would not typically present with the constellation of symptoms described, and heat exhaustion (option C) would be less severe and would not typically involve the degree of mental status change or the severity of symptoms seen in this case.",Success

Which of the following is the best initial step in the treatment of this patient?",C,"The image is not provided in the text-based format, but based on the description of the symptoms and the patient's history, the rash could be consistent with rosacea, a common skin condition that often presents as redness or flushing of the face, particularly in individuals who have recently been exposed to more sun or have changed their environment. Since the patient moved to Nevada, which is known for its sunny and dry climate, and started working outdoors, this could have exacerbated the condition.

Given the options provided, the most appropriate initial treatment for rosacea would be:

C. Topical metronidazole

Metronidazole is an antibiotic that is often used topically in the treatment of rosacea due to its anti-inflammatory properties and its ability to reduce the number of inflammatory lesions associated with the condition. It is typically applied as a cream, gel, or lotion to the affected areas of the skin.

Here is a brief explanation of why the other options are not the best initial step:

A. Oral tetracycline: While tetracycline can be used in the treatment of rosacea, it is generally reserved for more severe cases with a significant inflammatory component. Starting with a topical treatment like metronidazole is less invasive and can be tried first.

B. Oral clonidine: Clonidine is a medication primarily used to treat high blood pressure and is not indicated for the treatment of skin rashes or rosacea.

D. Topical benzoyl peroxide: This is typically used for acne treatment and may be too harsh for the sensitive skin of someone with rosacea.

E. Vascular laser: This is a more invasive treatment option that is used for the redness and blood vessels associated with rosacea but is not usually the first line of treatment. It is often reserved for cases where topical treatments have not been effective.

He also stated that he used to have ‘high blood sugars’ when checked in the hospital 4 years ago, but he did not follow up regarding this issue. He works as a farmer and noticed that it became much harder for him to work in the last few days because of fatigue and syncope. He has a 24-pack-year history of smoking and consumes alcohol occasionally. The vital signs include: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). On physical examination, the patient is pale and acrocyanotic. There is a visible jugular vein distention and bilateral lower leg pitting edema. The pulmonary auscultation is significant for occasional bilateral wheezes. Cardiac auscultation is significant for a decreased S1, S3 gallop, and grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border in the 4th left intercostal space. Abdominal percussion and palpation are suggestive of ascites. The hepatic margin is 3 cm below the right costal margin. Hepatojugular reflux is positive. Which of the following is the most likely clinical finding observed in this patient on an echocardiogram?",B,"Based on the patient's history, symptoms, and physical examination findings, the most likely clinical finding observed on an echocardiogram would be:

B. Increased peak tricuspid regurgitation

The patient's history of myocardial infarction, symptoms of fatigue, syncope, leg swelling, and right upper abdominal tenderness, along with physical examination findings of jugular vein distention, bilateral lower leg pitting edema, a decreased S1, S3 gallop, and a systolic murmur, are all consistent with right-sided heart failure. The positive hepatojugular reflux and the presence of ascites also support this diagnosis. Tricuspid regurgitation is a common finding in right-sided heart failure and would be reflected by an increased peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity on echocardiography.

However, it's also important to note that other options such as A. Left ventricular ejection fraction of 41% and C. Hypokinetic wall of the left ventricle are also plausible given the patient's history of myocardial infarction. These findings would be consistent with left ventricular dysfunction, which can lead to heart failure and contribute to the patient's symptoms. But, given the specific question about the most likely echocardiographic finding, increased peak tricuspid regurgitation is the most directly associated with the clinical presentation described.",Success
"A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of difficulty discarding items in her home. She says that the accumulation of things in her kitchen and dining room makes regular use of these spaces incredibly difficult. Her behavior started when she was in high school. She feels anxious when she tries to discard her possessions and her husband tries to clean and organize the home. This behavior frustrates her because most of the items she saves have little emotional or monetary value. She reports that there has been no improvement despite attending cognitive behavioral therapy sessions for the past 6 months. She now feels that her behavior is “taking over” her life. She does not drink, smoke, or use illicit drugs. She takes no medications. Her temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 116/80 mm Hg. On mental status examination, she is calm, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. Her mood is depressed; her speech is organized, logical, and coherent; and there are no psychotic symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",B,"The patient's symptoms are most consistent with a diagnosis of hoarding disorder, which is characterized by persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value. This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated with discarding them. The patient's history of attending cognitive behavioral therapy sessions without improvement suggests that medication may be necessary to manage her symptoms. Among the options provided, fluoxetine (option B) is the most appropriate next step in management. Fluoxetine is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) that has been shown to be effective in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which shares some features with hoarding disorder. While there is no medication specifically approved for hoarding disorder, SSRIs have been used off-label to treat this condition. The other options (A, C, D, E) are not typically used to treat hoarding disorder or OCD.",Success
"A 59-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider complaining of diffuse bodily aches. She reports a 3-month history of gradually worsening pain in her shoulders and hips that is worse in her right hip. She has a history of hypertension and recurrent renal stones for which she takes lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. She was admitted to the hospital earlier in the year after falling in her front yard and sustaining a distal radius fracture and vertebral compression fracture. Her temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 20/min. On exam, she is well-appearing with mild tenderness to palpation in her shoulders and hips. She has mild pain with hip flexion and shoulder abduction. She has full range of motion in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Serum findings are notable for the following:

Serum:
Na+: 141 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.8 mEq/L
HCO3-: 22 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen: 17 mg/dL
Glucose: 110 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.12 mg/dL
Ca2+: 11.2 mg/dL
Phosphate: 2.3 mg/dL
Mg2+: 1.9 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase: 120 U/L

A radiograph of this patient’s right hip would most likely reveal which of the following?",E,"Given the patient's history of recurrent renal stones, hypertension, and recent fractures, as well as her serum findings, which include a slightly elevated calcium (11.2 mg/dL) and low phosphate (2.3 mg/dL), the radiograph of her right hip is most likely to reveal an expansile lytic lesion with thin sclerotic margins (Option A). This presentation is consistent with a condition such as hyperparathyroidism, which can cause bone pain and increased risk of fractures due to bone resorption. The radiographic appearance of expansile lytic lesions with thin sclerotic margins can be seen in conditions like hyperparathyroidism where there is increased bone turnover.",Success
"A 20-year-old woman is brought in for a psychiatric consultation by her mother who is concerned because of her daughter’s recent bizarre behavior. The patient’s father died from lung cancer 1 week ago. Though this has been stressful for the whole family, the daughter has been hearing voices and having intrusive thoughts ever since. These voices have conversations about her and how she should have been the one to die and they encourage her to kill herself. She has not been able to concentrate at work or at school. She has no other history of medical or psychiatric illness. She denies recent use of any medication. Today, her heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, and temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F). On physical exam, she appears gaunt and anxious. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. CMP, CBC, and TSH are normal. A urine toxicology test is negative. What is the patient’s most likely diagnosis?",A,"The patient's symptoms, which include hearing voices, having intrusive thoughts, and experiencing significant distress in daily functioning following the death of her father, are indicative of a psychotic disorder. Given the acute onset and the fact that these symptoms have emerged in the context of a significant stressor (the death of her father), the most likely diagnosis is:

A. Brief psychotic disorder

Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms (such as hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech and behavior) that occur in response to a stressful event and last for at least 1 day but less than 1 month. The patient's symptoms began shortly after her father's death, and there is no indication that they have been present for longer than a month, which supports this diagnosis over schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder. Adjustment disorder (C) typically does not include psychotic symptoms, and bereavement (E) refers to the normal grieving process and does not encompass the psychotic symptoms described.",Success
"A 58-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with difficulty breathing and a sensation that her heart was racing for the past 3 days. She adds that she has lost weight over the last 7 weeks, despite a good appetite, and is anxious most of the time with difficulty sleeping at night. She has smoked 10 cigarettes per day for the past 15 years. Her blood pressure is 100/55 mmHg, temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), and pulse is irregular with a rate of 140–150/min. On physical examination she is thin, frail, and appears anxious. Her palms are sweaty and there are fine tremors on extension of both hands. She has a palpable smooth thyroid mass. Examination of the eyes reveals bilateral exophthalmos. An electrocardiogram is obtained and shown in the picture. Which of the following has a strong positive correlation with this patient’s heart rhythm?",D,"The ECG shown in the picture is not described, but given the context of the question and the patient's symptoms, we can infer that the patient is likely experiencing atrial fibrillation (AF), which is a common arrhythmia in patients with hyperthyroidism. Among the options provided, the one that has a strong positive correlation with atrial fibrillation in the context of this patient's presentation is:

C. QT interval

However, this answer might be misleading as a prolonged QT interval is not typically associated with atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is more commonly associated with a short PR interval, but that is not one of the options. The correct answer based on the options provided and the context of the question should actually be:

A. Digoxin blood level

A high digoxin level can lead to arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation. However, it's important to note that the question asks for a correlation with the patient's heart rhythm, and without further information about the ECG, it's difficult to definitively link the rhythm to any of the provided options. Given the context, an elevated digoxin level could potentially contribute to the patient's irregular heart rhythm, but the question does not provide enough information to confirm this.

The other options (B, D, and E) are not typically directly correlated with the development of atrial fibrillation in the context of the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Age (D) can be a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, but it is not a direct correlation with the heart rhythm in this case. Amiodarone (E) is a medication used to treat arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, but a blood level would not be correlated with the heart rhythm unless the patient was on the medication, which is not indicated in the question.",Success
A 27-year-old male suddenly develops severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea. The patient reports consuming undercooked ground beef four days prior to the onset of the symptoms. Which of the following best describes the toxin-mediated mechanism of this disease process?,E,"The correct answer is A. Depolymerization of actin filaments in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, leading to mucosal cell death. This is because the patient's symptoms are consistent with a Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) infection, which is commonly associated with undercooked ground beef. Shiga toxins produced by STEC depolymerize actin filaments in the cytoskeleton of gastrointestinal mucosal cells, leading to cell death and the characteristic symptoms of bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramping.",Success
"A 46-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with one week of intermittent nausea and vomiting. She does not have any sick contacts, and her medical history is significant only for diabetes well-controlled on metformin. She also complains of some weakness and back/leg pain. She says that she recently returned from traveling abroad and had been administered an antibiotic during her travels for an unknown infection. On presentation, her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 119/78 mmHg, pulse is 62/min, and respirations are 25/min. An EKG is obtained showing flattening of the T wave. After further testing, the physician prescribes a thiazide for this patient. Which of the following diseases is also associated with this patient's most likely diagnosis?",E,"The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, weakness, back/leg pain, along with the EKG finding of T wave flattening, suggest a diagnosis of hyponatremia, which can be caused by a number of conditions, including diuretic use, endocrine disorders, and renal disorders. The patient's recent antibiotic use and travel history suggest a possible infection, which could also contribute to hyponatremia. Of the options given, Wilson disease is the only one associated with hyponatremia. Wilson disease is a genetic disorder that results in the accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, and other organs, leading to a variety of symptoms, including neurological and psychiatric symptoms, liver disease, and, in some cases, hyponatremia. Therefore, the answer is E. Wilson disease. However, it's worth noting that Wilson disease is a relatively rare condition, and the patient's symptoms could also be due to other more common causes of hyponatremia, such as diuretic use or endocrine disorders. Further testing would be needed to confirm the diagnosis.",Success
"A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. He was the front seat unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale of 5 and is subsequently intubated. Physical exam is notable for subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area. Needle decompression and chest tube placement are performed, and the patient is stabilized after receiving 2 units of blood and 2 liters of fluid. Chest radiography demonstrates proper tube location and resolution of the pneumothorax. The patient is transferred to the trauma intensive care unit. On the unit, a repeat chest radiograph is notable for a recurrent pneumothorax with the chest tube in place. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The most likely diagnosis in this scenario is E. Tracheobronchial rupture. The patient's history of a high-impact motor vehicle collision, the presence of subcutaneous emphysema, and the recurrence of the pneumothorax despite appropriate chest tube placement and initial resolution suggest a persistent air leak, which is most commonly associated with a tracheobronchial injury. This type of injury can lead to air leaking from the airway into the pleural space, causing a pneumothorax that does not resolve with standard chest tube management.",Success
"A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 12 hours after the sudden onset of shortness of breath and substernal chest pain at rest; the pain is increased by inspiration.

His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 125/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 85/45 mm Hg. Physical examination shows distended neck veins. Auscultation of the chest discloses bilateral basilar rales and muffled heart sounds. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia, diffuse ST segment elevation, low voltage QRS complexes, and fluctuating R wave amplitude. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is E. Cardiac tamponade. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, substernal chest pain increased by inspiration, nonproductive cough, fever, and malaise, along with the physical examination findings of distended neck veins, bilateral basilar rales, muffled heart sounds, and the ECG findings of sinus tachycardia, diffuse ST segment elevation, low voltage QRS complexes, and fluctuating R wave amplitude, are all consistent with cardiac tamponade. This condition occurs when fluid accumulates in the pericardial space, leading to compression of the heart and impaired filling, which can result in hypotension and shock if severe.",Success
A 34-year-old man comes to the physician because of frequent headaches and blurry vision during the past 4 months. He has also had difficulties achieving an erection over the past few weeks. Physical examination shows a temporal visual field deficit bilaterally. An MRI of the brain shows an intrasellar mass. The mass is most likely derived from which of the following types of cells?,B,"The mass is most likely derived from C. Somatotrophs.

Intrasellar masses, especially those that present with symptoms like frequent headaches, visual field deficits, and difficulties achieving an erection, are often pituitary adenomas. The symptoms described are consistent with a pituitary tumor pressing on the optic chiasm (causing visual field deficits) and affecting hormonal functions (causing erectile dysfunction).

Among the options given, somatotrophs are the cells that produce growth hormone (GH). A tumor derived from these cells is known as a somatotroph adenoma, which can lead to acromegaly in adults (a condition characterized by excessive growth hormone secretion). However, in this context, the symptoms could also be indicative of a prolactinoma (a tumor derived from lactotrophs), which can cause similar symptoms including erectile dysfunction and visual disturbances due to its size and location. But since the question asks for the most likely cell type, and given that prolactinomas are not listed as an option, somatotrophs are the best answer among the choices provided.",Success

"A 45-year-old G3P3 presents complaining of the feeling of a foreign body in her vagina that worsens on standing. She does not have urinary or fecal incontinence or any other genitourinary symptoms. She has no known gynecologic diseases. There were no complications with her pregnancies, all of which were full-term vaginal deliveries. She is sexually active with her husband and no longer uses oral contraceptives. She has an 11 pack-year history of smoking. Her weight is 79 kg (174 lb) and her height is 155 cm (5 ft). Her vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination is unremarkable. The gynecologic examination reveals descent of the cervix halfway towards the introitus. On Valsalva and standing, the cervix descents to the plane of the hymen. The uterus is not enlarged and the ovaries are non-palpable. Which of the following treatments is most reasonable to offer this patient?",A,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with uterine prolapse, which is the descent of the uterus into the vagina. The degree of prolapse described (cervix descending to the plane of the hymen on Valsalva and standing) suggests a moderate to severe case. Given her history of smoking, weight, and multiple vaginal deliveries, she is at increased risk for pelvic floor disorders.

A pessary, which can be either a support pessary (Option A) or a space-filling pessary (Option C), is a non-surgical treatment option that can be used to support the prolapsed organs and alleviate symptoms. However, the choice between a support pessary and a space-filling pessary depends on the specific needs of the patient and the degree of prolapse. Given the moderate to severe nature of her prolapse, a space-filling pessary (Option C) may be more appropriate as it can provide more significant support.

Estrogen therapy (Option B) can be used to help maintain vaginal health and tone, but it is not a primary treatment for uterine prolapse.

Posterior colporrhaphy (Option D) is a surgical procedure used to repair a rectocele, which is not the primary issue in this case.

Sacral colpopexy (Option E) is a surgical procedure that uses mesh to attach the top of the vagina to the sacrum, providing support for the vagina and uterus. It is a more invasive option and is typically reserved for more severe cases of uterine prolapse or when other non-surgical and less invasive surgical options have failed.

Given the patient's symptoms and the moderate to severe nature of her prolapse, the most reasonable initial treatment to offer would be a space-filling pessary (Option C). This would allow for symptom relief and provide support without the risks associated with surgery. If the pessary is not effective or if the patient prefers a more permanent solution, sacral colpopexy (Option E) could be considered as a surgical option.",Success

Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?",C,"The presence of nontender cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, an enlarged spleen, and a slightly elevated white blood cell count with a normal platelet count in a 69-year-old woman could be indicative of a variety of conditions, including infection, inflammation, or malignancy. Given the options provided, we are looking for a finding that is most consistent with a hematological malignancy, given the age of the patient and the specific findings.

A. Ringed sideroblasts are associated with sideroblastic anemias, which typically do not present with lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly.

B. Teardrop cells (dacrocytes) can be seen in myelofibrosis, which can present with splenomegaly and sometimes lymphadenopathy, but this is not the most likely finding based on the given information.

C. Smudge cells, also known as Dohle bodies, are small fragments of neutrophils that can be seen in the peripheral blood smear of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL is a common leukemia in older adults and can present with lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and a slightly elevated white blood cell count. This is the most likely finding based on the given information.

D. Reed-Sternberg cells are characteristic of Hodgkin lymphoma, which can present with lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. However, the presence of smudge cells is more indicative of CLL than Hodgkin lymphoma.

E. Hypergammaglobulinemia can be seen in a variety of conditions, including chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and some malignancies. It is not a specific finding for the condition described in the question.

A 44-year-old man comes to the clinic because of a 6-month history of progressive fatigue. He has a history of intravenous heroin use. Physical examination shows scleral icterus. A serum study is positive for hepatitis C RNA. Therapy with interferon-α is initiated in combination with a second drug. The expected beneficial effect of the additional drug is most likely due to inhibition of which of the following enzymes?,B,"The additional drug used in combination with interferon-α for the treatment of hepatitis C is most likely to be a ribavirin, which is an antiviral drug. Ribavirin exerts its antiviral effect by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of guanosine nucleotides. By inhibiting IMPDH, ribavirin leads to a decrease in the intracellular levels of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is required for viral RNA synthesis. This results in the accumulation of defective viral RNA and ultimately leads to the inhibition of viral replication. Therefore, the expected beneficial effect of the additional drug is most likely due to inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (option B).",Success

The most likely syndrome in this case is Lynch syndrome, which is characterized by defects in the mismatch repair (MMR) system. MMR is responsible for correcting errors that occur during DNA replication, and defects in this system can lead to the accumulation of mutations, particularly in microsatellite regions of the genome. This can result in the development of colorectal and other cancers. Therefore, the most likely impaired process in this patient is mismatch repair (Option D).",Success

A study is conducted to determine the most effective ways to prevent transmission of various infective agents. One of the agents studied is a picornavirus that preferentially infects hepatocytes. The investigator determines that inactivating this virus can prevent its spread. Which of the following disinfectants is most likely to inactivate this virus?,C,"Picornaviruses are a family of non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. They are generally more resistant to disinfectants than enveloped viruses but can still be inactivated by certain agents. Among the options provided, sodium hypochlorite (C) is known to be effective against a broad range of viruses, including non-enveloped viruses like picornaviruses. Sodium hypochlorite is a strong oxidizing agent that can disrupt the viral capsid and inactivate the virus.

"A medical student decides to join an immunology research center, which specifically works on capsular polysaccharide vaccine development against bacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. As a member of a research team working on the Hib vaccine, he asks his senior colleague why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers like tetanus toxoid during vaccine development. Which of the following is the best response to this question?",E,"The best response to the medical student's question is:

E. Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants

Explanation: Capsular polysaccharides from bacteria like Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae are T cell-dependent antigens when conjugated to protein carriers. This conjugation process helps to elicit a stronger and more durable immune response, particularly in infants and young children whose immune systems are still developing. The protein carrier, such as tetanus toxoid, acts as a helper T cell epitope, which enhances the presentation of the polysaccharide antigen to the immune system. This results in the production of IgG antibodies, which provide long-lasting immunity and memory responses. Additionally, conjugate vaccines can induce herd immunity, further protecting vulnerable populations.",Success
An investigator is studying the pattern of glutamate release from presynaptic nerve terminals in human volunteers with Alzheimer disease. The concentration of glutamate in the CA1 region of the hippocampus is measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy after Schaffer collateral fibers are electrically stimulated. Which of the following events most likely occurs immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters?,E,"The event that most likely occurs immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters, in this case, glutamate, is the influx of calcium (Option E). When an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open, allowing calcium ions to enter the cell. This influx of calcium triggers the fusion of vesicles containing glutamate with the presynaptic membrane, leading to the release of glutamate into the synaptic cleft.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman presents to a physician with a history of exposure to a close friend who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. She was told by her friend that she need to see a physician because she needs to be treated as well, even if she is not having symptoms yet. She currently denies any headaches, vision changes, nausea or vomiting, or neck stiffness. Her physical exam is within normal limits. Her vital signs are stable. She is prescribed rifampin for prophylaxis with specific instructions on when to follow up if symptoms develop. When asked about the possibility of pregnancy, she mentioned that she uses combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for contraception. The physician suggested that her husband should use condoms for contraception as she requires antibiotic therapy. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the need for additional contraception?",A,"The correct answer is:

B. Rifampin inhibits CYP3A4, which metabolizes progestins.

However, this statement is incorrect. Rifampin is actually a potent inducer of CYP3A4 and other drug-metabolizing enzymes, including those that metabolize estrogens and progestins. This induction can lead to increased metabolism of the hormones in oral contraceptive pills, potentially reducing their effectiveness.

They say that their grandson has been using these medications for many years; however, they are unable to provide any medical history and claim that their grandson has been behaving strangely, exhibiting facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements for the past few days. They also note that he has had no teeth since the time they first met him at the age of 2. An intramuscular medication is administered to calm the boy down prior to drawing blood from him for laboratory tests. Which of the following biochemical pathway abnormalities is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?",D,"The most likely cause of this patient’s condition, given the symptoms and the information provided, is related to option D: Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) of the purine metabolism pathway. This enzyme is involved in the salvage pathway of purine metabolism, which recycles purines from nucleotides that have been broken down. A deficiency in HPRT can lead to the accumulation of uric acid and other metabolites that can cause a disorder known as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is characterized by self-mutilative behavior, cognitive impairment, and movement disorders such as dystonia and choreoathetosis. The facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements described in the patient are consistent with these movement disorders. Additionally, the patient’s lack of teeth since the age of 2 may be related to the syndrome, as some patients with Lesch-Nyhan have dental abnormalities.

The other options listed involve enzymes in different metabolic pathways that do not typically present with the symptoms described in the patient. For instance, Aminolevulinic acid synthetase is involved in heme metabolism, Adenosine deaminase is involved in purine metabolism but not in a way that typically causes the symptoms described, and Thymidylate synthetase is involved in pyrimidine metabolism.

Zinc is an essential trace element that plays a critical role in various physiological processes, including wound healing, immune function, and cell division. It is also important for the health of the skin and hair. Zinc deficiency can lead to hair loss (alopecia), skin lesions (including erythematous plaques), and a loss of taste (hypogeusia or dysgeusia). These symptoms are consistent with the patient's presentation.

Patients with Crohn's disease, especially those who have undergone segmental small bowel resection, are at increased risk for zinc deficiency due to malabsorption and reduced surface area for nutrient absorption.

Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?""",B,"The best next step in management for this patient, given her history and current examination, is Option B: Repeat antibody screening at 28 weeks. Administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks and after delivery if the newborn is Rh(D) positive.

Since the patient is Rh-negative and has a history of a blood transfusion, she may have been sensitized to Rh-positive antigens. The fact that her anti-D antibody screen is currently negative is reassuring, but sensitization can occur at any time during pregnancy, particularly after 28 weeks when fetomaternal hemorrhage is more likely. Therefore, repeating the antibody screening at 28 weeks is appropriate to ensure that no sensitization has occurred.

Administering anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks is a prophylactic measure to prevent sensitization, which is standard practice for Rh-negative women. Additionally, administering anti-D immunoglobulin after delivery if the newborn is Rh(D) positive is crucial to prevent the mother from becoming sensitized to Rh(D) antigens, which could cause hemolytic disease of the newborn in future pregnancies.",Success

Physical exam reveals bilateral redness over the maxillary prominences. Which of the following is most likely to be seen in this patient?",B,"Based on the symptoms presented, the patient could be experiencing symptoms consistent with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), given her joint pain, fatigue, fever, and a sunburn-like rash on her face. SLE is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs and systems, including the skin, joints, and kidneys. The presence of a rash that she attributes to sun exposure is particularly suggestive of lupus, as photosensitivity is a common feature of this disease.

Option B, decreased complement levels, is the most likely to be seen in this patient. Decreased levels of complement proteins (C3 and C4) are commonly found in patients with SLE, especially during active disease. This is because the complement system is involved in the clearance of immune complexes, which are often elevated in lupus and can lead to complement consumption.

Anti-dsDNA antibodies (Option A) are also frequently seen in SLE, but decreased levels would not be expected. Increased levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies are more indicative of lupus.

Anti-centromere antibodies (Option C) are associated with a subset of scleroderma, not lupus.

Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (Option D) are associated with rheumatoid arthritis, not lupus.

Anti-topoisomerase antibodies (Option E) are associated with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and not typically found in lupus.

This area is extremely tender to palpation, and palpation elicits an unusual 'crunchy' sensation. CT scan shows free air in the soft tissue of the left leg. The organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation is also a common cause of which of the following conditions?",D,"The patient's presentation is consistent with a severe soft tissue infection, possibly a necrotizing fasciitis, given the description of a 'crunchy' sensation on palpation and the presence of free air in the soft tissue on CT scan. This suggests the involvement of gas-forming bacteria. The most likely culprit in this scenario is Clostridium perfringens, which is a gas-forming anaerobic bacterium. Among the options provided, C. perfringens is also a common cause of food-borne illness (Option D).

C. perfringens produces toxins that can cause symptoms ranging from mild to severe gastrointestinal illness when ingested in contaminated food. This is due to the production of enterotoxins by certain strains of the bacteria. In the context of food-borne illness, symptoms typically include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting, and can occur within hours of ingesting contaminated food.

While C. perfringens can cause other infections such as gas gangrene and myonecrosis (necrotizing fasciitis), it is not typically associated with endocarditis (Option A), pneumonia (Option B), sinusitis (Option C), or urinary tract infections (Option E).

An ECG shows the absence of P-waves with an irregular RR complex. A few hours later, his symptoms subside and he is discharged with an additional anticoagulation drug. Which of the following mechanisms explains how this new medication will exert its effects?",D,"The ECG findings and symptoms suggest that the patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cardiac arrhythmia characterized by the absence of P-waves and an irregular RR interval. Anticoagulation is often used in AF to prevent stroke and systemic embolism, which are potential complications due to the increased risk of clot formation in the atria.

The new medication prescribed is likely an anticoagulant, which would work by inhibiting the formation of blood clots. Among the options provided, the mechanism of action that best fits an anticoagulant used for AF is:

D. Inhibition of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors

This mechanism is characteristic of vitamin K antagonists like warfarin, which inhibit the gamma-carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X), thereby preventing their activation and reducing clot formation. More recently, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban have also been used for anticoagulation in AF. These drugs either inhibit thrombin (dabigatran) or factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) directly, without the need for antithrombin or vitamin K inhibition.

The other options are not typically used for anticoagulation in AF:
A. Activation of the antithrombin enzyme - This is the mechanism of action for heparin, which is not typically used for long-term anticoagulation in AF due to the need for monitoring and dose adjustments.
B. Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzyme - This is the mechanism of action for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin, which are not effective anticoagulants for AF.
C. Inhibition of the ADP receptors - This is the mechanism of action for antiplatelet agents like clopidogrel, which are not as effective as anticoagulants for stroke prevention in AF.
E. Blockage of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors - This is the mechanism of action for antiplatelet agents used in acute coronary syndromes and percutaneous coronary interventions, not for anticoagulation in AF.",Success
"A 31-year-old man, who was hospitalized for substance-induced psychosis two days prior, has had episodic neck stiffness and pain for the past 8 hours.

Examination shows a flexed neck rotated to the right. The neck is rigid with limited range of motion. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms?",A,"The patient's symptoms are most consistent with tardive dyskinesia or drug-induced dystonia, which can be a side effect of antipsychotic medications like haloperidol. The neck stiffness, pain, and involuntary movement (rotation to the right) are indicative of dystonic reactions. The fact that the patient was able to relieve the stiffness by lightly touching his jaw also suggests a dystonic reaction, as these movements can sometimes be temporarily alleviated by voluntary movements or external stimuli.

Among the options provided, Benztropine (Option A) is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms. Benztropine is an anticholinergic medication that is often used to treat extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) of antipsychotic medications, including dystonic reactions. It works by blocking the effects of acetylcholine, which can help to counteract the effects of dopamine blockade caused by antipsychotic medications.

Options B through E are not as appropriate for the treatment of drug-induced dystonia:

B. Physical therapy might be helpful in managing symptoms but would not be the primary treatment for drug-induced dystonia.
C. Dantrolene is used to treat malignant hyperthermia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome, not dystonic reactions.
D. Baclofen is a muscle relaxant used primarily for spasticity, not for dystonic reactions.

Which of the following the most appropriate initial course of treatment of this patient?",C,"The patient's presentation is consistent with delirium tremens, a severe form of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms include fever, confusion, agitation, and visual hallucinations (complaining about bugs crawling over his skin). The most appropriate initial treatment for this condition is to address the underlying cause, which is alcohol withdrawal, and to manage the symptoms.

Among the options given, Diazepam (Option C) is the most appropriate initial treatment. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that can help manage the agitation, anxiety, and seizures that may occur in alcohol withdrawal. It works by enhancing the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which has a calming effect on the brain.

Chlorpromazine (Option A) and Haloperidol (Option D) are antipsychotics that can be used to manage agitation and psychosis, but they are not typically the first-line treatment for alcohol withdrawal. Clonidine (Option B) can be used to manage autonomic symptoms like hypertension and tachycardia but does not address the underlying alcohol withdrawal. Phenytoin (Option E) is an antiepileptic drug and is not typically used for the initial management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

"Eight weeks after starting a new weight-loss medication, a 43-year-old woman with obesity comes to the physician because of greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence. She also complains of progressively worsening night-time vision. She has had no fever, chills, or vomiting. Physical examination shows dry, scaly skin on her extremities and face. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of action of the drug she is taking?",D,"The symptoms described in the case—greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, flatulence, worsening night-time vision, and dry, scaly skin—point to a deficiency in fat-soluble vitamins and malabsorption issues. The most likely mechanism of action of the drug she is taking that would cause these symptoms is inhibition of lipase (Option D).

Lipase inhibitors, such as orlistat, work by blocking the action of lipase enzymes in the digestive system. These enzymes are responsible for breaking down dietary fats into fatty acids and glycerol, which can then be absorbed by the body. When lipase is inhibited, dietary fats are not properly broken down and are not absorbed, leading to their excretion in the feces. This results in symptoms such as greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence due to the presence of undigested fats in the intestines.

The worsening night-time vision and dry, scaly skin suggest a deficiency in fat-soluble vitamins, particularly vitamin A, which is essential for vision and skin health. Since fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) require dietary fats for their absorption, the inhibition of lipase can lead to deficiencies in these vitamins, causing the symptoms described in the patient.

The other options (A, B, C, and E) are not associated with the symptoms described in the case and do not involve mechanisms that would lead to malabsorption or vitamin deficiencies.",Success

This drug blocks the Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule, which is consistent with the description given. Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic that works by inhibiting the reabsorption of sodium in the distal tubule, which in turn increases the excretion of sodium and water while sparing potassium. This mechanism of action is distinct from other diuretics listed, such as loop diuretics (furosemide), thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide), carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide), and aldosterone antagonists (eplerenone).",Success
"A 59-year-old man with a history of sickle cell disease presents to the emergency department for evaluation of his fever and night sweats. He is extremely lethargic and is unable to provide an adequate history to his physician. His wife noted that roughly 3 days ago, her husband mentioned that something bit him, but she cannot remember what exactly. The vital signs include blood pressure 85/67 mm Hg, pulse rate 107/min, and respiratory rate 35/min. Upon examination, the man is currently afebrile but is lethargic and pale. His spleen is surgically absent. There are some swollen bite marks on his right hand with red streaks extending to his elbow. Which of the following bites would be most concerning in this patient?",E,"The most concerning bite in this patient would be C. Spider bite, particularly if it was a venomous spider like a brown recluse or a black widow. The symptoms described, including fever, night sweats, lethargy, and the presence of red streaks extending from the bite site, are consistent with a severe local reaction and potential systemic toxicity from a venomous spider bite. The patient's history of sickle cell disease may also contribute to a more severe reaction and complications. The other bite options listed (cat, human, fish, and dog) can also cause infections, but they typically do not present with such rapid systemic symptoms unless there is a significant infection or underlying health issue.",Success
A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing weakness in both legs for 7 days. She also reports a tingling sensation in her legs that is exacerbated by taking a hot shower. She is sexually active with one male partner and does not use condoms. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.1°F). Physical examination shows decreased muscle strength and clonus in both lower extremities. Patellar reflex is 4+ bilaterally and plantar reflex shows an extensor response on both sides. Abdominal reflex is absent. An MRI of the brain is shown. Which of the following findings is most likely to further support the diagnosis in this patient?,C,"The patient's symptoms and the MRI findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Among the given options, the finding that would most likely support this diagnosis is:

C. Presence of immunoglobulin bands on cerebrospinal fluid immunofixation

This finding indicates the presence of oligoclonal bands, which are commonly found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MS. These bands represent the intrathecal production of immunoglobulins, particularly IgG, and are a hallmark of the disease. They are not typically found in the serum, making them a specific marker for central nervous system inflammation, such as in MS.

Option A (positive antibody response to cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen in the serum) is associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, not MS.

Option B (oligodendrocytes that stain positive for polyomavirus proteins on brain biopsy) suggests a diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is caused by reactivation of the JC polyomavirus and is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Option D (identification of gram-positive cocci in groups on blood culture) suggests a bacterial infection, which is not relevant to the patient's neurological symptoms.

Option E (detection of high-affinity antibodies to dsDNA in the serum) is indicative of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs but is not typically associated with the neurological presentation described.",Success
A group of investigators is studying the association between a fire retardant chemical used on furniture and interstitial lung disease. They use hospital records to identify 50 people who have been diagnosed with interstitial lung disease. They also identify a group of 50 people without interstitial lung disease who are matched in age and geographic location to those with the disease. The participants' exposure to the chemical is assessed by surveys and home visits. Which of the following best describes this study design?,A,"A. Case-control study

This study design is best described as a case-control study because it involves comparing a group of individuals with a specific disease (cases) to a group of individuals without the disease (controls). The exposure to a potential risk factor (the fire retardant chemical) is then assessed retrospectively. This type of study is useful for investigating potential causes of a disease.",Success
"A 41-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a suicide attempt. His wife found him on the bathroom floor with an empty bottle of medication next to him. He has a history of major depressive disorder. His only medication is nortriptyline. His pulse is 127/min and blood pressure is 90/61 mm Hg. Examination shows dilated pupils and dry skin. The abdomen is distended and there is dullness on percussion in the suprapubic region. An ECG shows tachycardia and a QRS complex width of 130 ms. In addition to intravenous fluid resuscitation, which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",E,"The most appropriate pharmacotherapy in this case is:

C. Cyproheptadine

The patient's symptoms and the history of nortriptyline overdose suggest anticholinergic toxicity, which is common with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdoses. Cyproheptadine is a competitive antagonist at serotonin and histamine receptors and can help to reverse anticholinergic effects. It is often used in the treatment of TCA overdose to counteract the anticholinergic effects of these drugs.

Atropine (Option A) is an anticholinergic drug and would exacerbate the patient's condition. Naloxone (Option B) is used for opioid overdose and is not indicated here. Ammonium chloride (Option D) is an acidifying agent used to treat metabolic alkalosis and would not be helpful in this scenario. Sodium bicarbonate (Option E) is used to treat metabolic acidosis and can be used to alkalinize the urine in some poisonings, but it is not the primary treatment for TCA overdose.",Success
"A 23-year-old woman presents to the hospital for elective surgery. However, due to an unexpected bleeding event, the physician had to order a blood transfusion to replace the blood lost in the surgery. After this, the patient became irritable and had difficulty breathing, suggesting an allergic reaction, which was immediately treated with epinephrine. This patient is otherwise healthy, and her history does not indicate any health conditions or known allergies. The physician suspects an immunodeficiency disorder that was not previously diagnosed. If serum is taken from this patient to analyze her condition further, which of the following would be expected?",C,"The patient's symptoms and the context of the scenario suggest an allergic reaction following a blood transfusion. Allergic reactions to blood transfusions can occur due to antibodies in the recipient's serum reacting to antigens in the donor's blood. However, the question asks about the immunoglobulin levels that would be expected if serum is taken from this patient to analyze for an underlying immunodeficiency disorder.

The scenario does not provide enough information to definitively diagnose a specific immunodeficiency disorder, but we can make an educated guess based on the options provided and what is known about immunodeficiency disorders and their typical immunoglobulin profiles.

Option A (High IgM, low IgA, and IgE) could suggest an immunodeficiency, such as IgA deficiency, which is the most common primary immunodeficiency. However, high IgM is not typically associated with IgA deficiency.

Option B (Low IgA, high IgG, normal IgE) could also suggest IgA deficiency, which is characterized by low IgA levels. However, high IgG is not a typical feature of IgA deficiency.

Option C (Low IgA, normal IgG, and IgM) is the most consistent with IgA deficiency, which is characterized by low IgA levels while IgG and IgM are typically normal.

Option D (High IgE, normal IgA, and IgG) would suggest a condition characterized by high IgE levels, such as atopy or certain parasitic infections, which is not suggested by the scenario.

Option E (Normal serum immunoglobulin values) would suggest no immunodeficiency disorder, which is not consistent with the physician's suspicion of an underlying immunodeficiency.

Given the context and the options provided, the most likely answer based on the information given is:

C. Low IgA, normal IgG, and IgM

This is consistent with a primary immunodeficiency disorder, specifically IgA deficiency, which could potentially contribute to an increased risk of allergic reactions to blood transfusions due to the presence of anti-IgA antibodies in the patient's serum reacting to IgA in the donor blood.",Success
"A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being found unconscious in his apartment by his mother. On arrival, he is unable to provide history.

Urine toxicology is positive for opiates and cocaine. Intravenous fluids and sodium nitroprusside drip are started. The patient is most likely to have which of the following?""",E,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis consistent with rhabdomyolysis, a condition characterized by the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue that releases myoglobin into the bloodstream. Myoglobin is toxic to the kidneys and can lead to acute kidney injury. The presence of tea-colored urine, which is often due to myoglobinuria, along with positive findings for blood and protein in the urine, supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of drug use, as indicated by the positive urine toxicology for opiates and cocaine, can contribute to the development of rhabdomyolysis.

Among the given options, the one most likely to be associated with rhabdomyolysis is:

E. Elevated serum creatine kinase

Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme found in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. When muscle tissue is damaged, CK is released into the bloodstream, leading to elevated levels in the blood. In rhabdomyolysis, CK levels can be significantly elevated, often in the thousands of international units per liter (IU/L). This is a hallmark of the condition and is typically the first laboratory finding to suggest rhabdomyolysis.

The other options are less likely to be associated with this patient's presentation:

A. Low serum potassium - While electrolyte imbalances can occur in rhabdomyolysis, potassium levels can either be normal or elevated due to the release of potassium from damaged muscle cells.

B. Low serum lactate dehydrogenase - Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are typically elevated in rhabdomyolysis, not decreased, due to muscle damage.

C. Low blood urea nitrogen - In rhabdomyolysis, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels can be elevated due to acute kidney injury.

D. Elevated serum calcium - Hypercalcemia is not typically associated with rhabdomyolysis unless there is an underlying condition such as hyperparathyroidism or malignancy. In this case, there is no indication of such conditions.",Success
"A 30-year-old G4P3 woman at 38 weeks gestation is admitted to the labor and delivery unit complaining of contractions every 5 minutes for the past hour.

What is the best next step in management?",D,"The best next step in management in this scenario is likely to be:

C. Intravenous oxytocin

The patient is experiencing postpartum hemorrhage, as evidenced by the significant blood loss and drop in blood pressure. The first line of treatment for postpartum hemorrhage is usually uterine atony, which can be managed with uterotonic agents such as oxytocin. Oxytocin helps to contract the uterus and reduce bleeding. If oxytocin is not effective, other options such as uterine artery ligation or hysterectomy may be considered, but these are more invasive and are typically reserved for cases where less invasive measures have failed. Red blood cell transfusion (option E) may also be necessary if the patient continues to hemorrhage and her hemodynamic status deteriorates further. Elevating the posterior fornix (option D) is not a standard treatment for postpartum hemorrhage and would not be the best next step in this situation.",Success

Physical exam showed that his knee could be pushed posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion but it could not be pulled anteriorly in the same position. The anatomic structure that was most likely injured in this patient has which of the following characteristics?",E,"The anatomic structure that was most likely injured in this patient is the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). This ligament runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle (Option E). The mechanism of injury described (a collision from the front while the knee is in a flexed position) is consistent with a mechanism that can injure the PCL. The physical exam finding of being able to push the knee posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion but not being able to pull it anteriorly is also consistent with a PCL injury, as the PCL prevents posterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur.",Success

Which of the following is consistent with this man's pulmonary physiology?",E,"The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with pulmonary edema, likely due to left-sided heart failure secondary to non-adherence to his diuretic medication. Pulmonary edema can lead to an increased alveolar-arterial (Aa) gradient due to the decreased surface area for gas exchange and increased diffusion distance caused by the fluid in the alveoli. Therefore, the answer that is consistent with this man's pulmonary physiology is:

E. Increased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance",Success

The symptoms described, including fever, chills, fatigue, weakness, night sweats, and vomiting, along with the laboratory findings such as anemia (low hemoglobin and hematocrit), low leukocyte count, low platelet count, and elevated liver enzymes, are all indicative of malaria. The presence of basophilic ring- and pear-shaped structures inside red cells and extracellular basophilic rings on Wright-Giemsa staining, as well as the detection of parasitemia, schistocytes, poikilocytes, and merozoites in tetrad formation, further support this diagnosis.

"A 41-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath that is worse when she lies on her left side. About 10 days ago, she had an episode of unexplained loss of consciousness. Past medical history is negative and family history is irrelevant. Clinical examination shows a diastolic murmur, which is prominent when she lies on her left side. Jugular venous distention is present, and chest examination reveals fine crackles that do not clear with coughing. Chest X-ray shows pulmonary congestion, and 2-dimensional echocardiogram shows a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is E. Atrial myxoma. The patient's symptoms and clinical findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The shortness of breath, especially when lying on the left side (position-dependent dyspnea), the diastolic murmur heard in the same position, the presence of jugular venous distention, and the chest X-ray showing pulmonary congestion all suggest left-sided heart dysfunction. The 2-dimensional echocardiogram finding of a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum is highly suggestive of an atrial myxoma.

Atrial myxomas are benign tumors that can cause a variety of symptoms depending on their size and location. They can obstruct blood flow through the mitral valve, leading to symptoms such as dyspnea and pulmonary congestion. The murmur heard in this patient is likely due to this obstruction. Additionally, atrial myxomas can embolize, which may explain the patient's episode of unexplained loss of consciousness. This is because a piece of the tumor could have broken off and traveled to the brain, causing a transient ischemic attack or stroke.

The other options listed are less likely based on the patient's presentation:

A. Rheumatic fever typically presents with fever, arthritis, and carditis, often with a history of streptococcal infection. There would likely be no mass seen on echocardiography.

B. An innocent murmur would not be associated with the patient's symptoms or the findings on echocardiography.

C. Subacute infective endocarditis can cause similar symptoms, but there would likely be signs of infection such as fever, and the echocardiogram would show vegetations rather than a mass.

D. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis typically occurs in patients with malignancy or other hypercoagulable states and would not present with a mass on echocardiography.

An excisional biopsy of one of the cervical lymph nodes is performed. The histopathologic analysis is shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The image is not provided in the text, but based on the clinical presentation and the options given, we can make an educated deduction. The patient's history of HIV infection, the presence of painless cervical lymphadenopathy, and the lack of fever, night sweats, or weight loss do not suggest an acute infection like mononucleosis (Option D) or an acute leukemia (Option A). Phenytoin-induced adenopathy (Option E) is not a well-documented condition, and the patient's history of HIV and the pattern of lymphadenopathy make it less likely.

The high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the fact that the lymph nodes are non-tender and bilateral suggest a chronic inflammatory or neoplastic process. Given the patient's HIV status, the differential diagnosis includes HIV lymphadenopathy (Option C) and classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) (Option B), which can occur more frequently in HIV-positive individuals.

Without the image, it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis, but classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a possibility that should be considered given the patient's HIV status and the presence of enlarged lymph nodes. HIV lymphadenopathy can also present similarly, but if the histopathologic analysis shows Reed-Sternberg cells, which are characteristic of Hodgkin's lymphoma, then the diagnosis would be classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis would be:

B. Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL)",Success
"A 67-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for urinary incontinence. She has been waking up every morning with her underwear soaked in urine. She notices that at work if she does not take regular bathroom breaks her underwear will have some urine in it. She urinates 5 to 11 times per day but she claims it is a small volume. Her current medications include lisinopril, metformin, insulin, aspirin, atorvastatin, sodium docusate, and loratadine. Her temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 167/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities and a systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?",A,"The patient's symptoms and history suggest a diagnosis of urge incontinence, which is common in older adults, especially those with diabetes and neuropathy. The decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities and the use of metformin and insulin suggest a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. The patient's symptoms of waking up with soaked underwear and small-volume urination suggest a problem with bladder storage, which is consistent with urge incontinence.

The best treatment for this patient would be option D: Oxybutynin and scheduled bathroom breaks. Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic medication that can help relax the bladder muscle and reduce the frequency and urgency of urination. Scheduled bathroom breaks can also help the patient manage her symptoms by preventing the bladder from becoming too full and causing incontinence.

Option A (Bethanechol and intermittent straight catheterization) is not appropriate for this patient as Bethanechol is a cholinergic medication that can increase bladder muscle contractions and worsen incontinence. Intermittent straight catheterization is also not necessary in this case as the patient's symptoms are not related to bladder emptying.

Option B (Bethanechol during the day and oxybutynin at night) is also not appropriate as Bethanechol can worsen incontinence.

Option C (No recommendations needed) is not appropriate as the patient's symptoms are causing significant distress and require treatment.

Option E (Reduce fluid intake and discontinue diuretics) is not appropriate as reducing fluid intake can lead to dehydration and discontinuing diuretics can worsen hypertension.",Success

He mentions a cough that appears only at night, but which is persistent enough to wake him up from sleep. He mentions that he has had a ‘heart attack’ 5 years ago. He also says that he continues to consume alcohol on a regular basis even though his doctor has advised against it. He has brought his lab reports which he had recently got done on the suggestions of his family doctor. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and a chest X-ray are found. Which of the following is the next step in this patient’s management?",C,"The next step in this patient's management should be an echocardiogram (Option C). Given the patient's history of a previous heart attack, symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea (difficulty breathing when lying down), and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (waking up at night with a feeling of breathlessness), there is a high suspicion for heart failure. These symptoms, combined with the fact that he continues to consume alcohol despite medical advice, which can exacerbate heart failure, make an echocardiogram the most appropriate next step.

An echocardiogram will provide information about the structure and function of the heart, including the ejection fraction, which is often reduced in heart failure. It will also help assess for any valvular heart disease, pericardial effusion, and other structural abnormalities that might contribute to his symptoms. This information is crucial for guiding further management and treatment of his condition.

Angiography (Option A) might be necessary if there is a need to assess for coronary artery disease or if the echocardiogram shows evidence of ischemic heart disease, but it is not the first-line investigation in this scenario.

Computed Tomography (CT) (Option B) is not indicated as an initial investigation for this patient's symptoms, as it is not the best tool for evaluating cardiac function or structure in the context of heart failure.

A stress test (Option D) could be considered later in the management of this patient, but it is not the first-line investigation given his current symptoms and history of heart disease. Stress tests are typically used to assess for ischemic heart disease in patients without known coronary artery disease or to evaluate exercise capacity and response in stable patients.

Cardiac biopsy (Option E) is an invasive procedure typically reserved for diagnosing specific conditions such as myocarditis or infiltrative cardiomyopathies and is not a routine part of the initial workup for heart failure.",Success

Assuming this patient has no other cardiovascular defects, what is the most appropriate treatment?",A,"The most appropriate treatment for this scenario would be:

A. Indomethacin

The description of the murmur as a continuous machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border is characteristic of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which is common in preterm infants.

Her teachers describe her as “easily distracted” and “easily upset by change.” When asked about her hobbies and interests, she states that “marine biology” is her only interest and gives you a 15-minute unsolicited explanation of how to identify different penguin species. Mental status exam is notable for intense eye contact, flat affect, and concrete thought process.

Given the information provided, option B is the most accurate statement regarding her condition: ""Impaired attention is a key feature of the disorder.""

While impaired attention is not a diagnostic criterion for ASD, it is a common co-occurring feature in many individuals with the disorder. Attention difficulties can manifest as distractibility, which can impact learning and social interactions. However, it is important to note that not all individuals with ASD will have impaired attention, and the presence of attention difficulties does not necessarily mean an individual has ASD.

Regarding the other options:
A. Boys are more commonly affected than girls: This is generally true for ASD, but the question asks for a statement that is true regarding this specific child's disorder, and this statement does not provide information specific to her diagnosis.
C. Intellectual disability is a key feature of the disorder: This is not necessarily true. While some individuals with ASD may have intellectual disability, many others have average or above-average intelligence.
D. It is usually associated with a family history of schizophrenia: There is no strong evidence to suggest a direct association between ASD and a family history of schizophrenia. While there may be some genetic overlap, they are distinct disorders.
E. Typical age of onset is 3-5 years of age: This is often the case for ASD, but the question describes a child who is 12 years old and has been experiencing symptoms since starting middle school last year, which would be around the age of 11. This does not align with the typical age of onset for ASD, which is usually recognized much earlier in development.

They found that feeding her often with small servings helps. She was born at 39 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is meeting all developmental milestones. Her mother has one brother that occasionally requires blood transfusions. Today, her blood pressure is 55/33 mm Hg, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, and temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the infant is irritated. She is slightly jaundiced. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her blood work shows normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin. Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies are also ruled out. A Coombs test is negative. Red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal. The physician determined that these findings are related to an enzyme deficiency. Which of the following allosterically inhibits this enzyme?",A,"The infant's symptoms, including lethargy, irritability between meals, jaundice, normocytic anemia with an elevated reticulocyte count, decreased haptoglobin, and the ruling out of sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies, suggest a diagnosis of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. This enzyme deficiency can lead to hemolytic anemia, particularly in response to certain foods or medications that cause oxidative stress on red blood cells.

The enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is allosterically inhibited by NADP+ (not listed in the options). However, the options provided are related to other enzymes and metabolic pathways. Among the options given, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (option E) is an allosteric inhibitor of the enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, which is involved in gluconeogenesis. This is not directly related to G6PD deficiency, but it is the only option that correctly identifies a molecule that allosterically inhibits an enzyme.

The correct answer is:

E. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate

However, it is important to note that fructose 2,6-bisphosphate does not inhibit G6PD; it inhibits fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. The question seems to be designed to test knowledge of allosteric inhibition in metabolic pathways, but the context of G6PD deficiency is not directly related to the answer provided.",Success
"A 4-year-old boy presents for a routine checkup. The patient’s parents say he was doing well until a few weeks ago at which time he started to complain of daily abdominal cramps and occasional muscle pains. His mother also noticed that he has been less active than usual. The parents deny any complaints of headaches or convulsions. The family lives together in a house built in 1950. The patient’s temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg, pulse is 100/min and respirations are 20/min. Abdominal exam shows mild diffuse tenderness to palpation and normal bowel sounds. The patient’s height, weight, and head circumference are normal. Laboratory results are as follows:
Hemoglobin 7 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 72
Lead level (capillary blood) 15 mcg/dL
Lead level (venous blood) 60 mcg/dL
Findings on a peripheral blood smear are shown in the image. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?",E,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest lead poisoning, which is confirmed by the elevated lead levels in both capillary and venous blood. The peripheral blood smear shows basophilic stippling, which is also indicative of lead poisoning. The patient's age, 4 years, and the fact that he lives in a house built in 1950, which may contain lead-based paint, are additional risk factors for lead poisoning.

The best treatment option for this patient is E. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), also known as succimer. DMSA is a chelating agent that binds to lead and facilitates its excretion from the body. It is the preferred treatment for lead poisoning in children because it is well tolerated and can be administered orally. DMSA is particularly indicated in cases where the lead level is above 45 mcg/dL, which is the case for this patient.

Trientine (A), calcium disodium edetate (EDTA) (B), dimercaprol (C), and penicillamine (D) are also chelating agents used in the treatment of heavy metal poisoning, but they are not the first choice for lead poisoning in children. EDTA is used in severe cases of lead poisoning, usually in a hospital setting, and dimercaprol is primarily used for arsenic, mercury, and antimony poisoning. Penicillamine is used for Wilson's disease and cystinuria. Trientine is used for Wilson's disease.",Success
"A 39-year-old woman with poorly controlled systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents to her rheumatologist for a follow-up visit. She has had intermittent myalgias, arthralgias, fatigue, and skin rashes over the past 10 years that have acutely worsened over the past year. She works as a school teacher but reports that she has had to miss several days of work due to her symptoms. She has been on hydroxychloroquine for several years but does not feel that it is adequately controlling her symptoms. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, she is well-appearing and in no acute distress. She has erythematous, raised plaques with keratotic scaling and follicular plugging on her hands. The physician decides to trial the patient on low-dose prednisone to better control her symptoms. At 2 months of follow-up, she reports that her flares have subsided and she has been able to return to work full-time. If this patient continues this medication regimen, she will be at an elevated risk for developing which of the following?",A,"A. Femoral neck fracture

Long-term use of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, can lead to osteoporosis, a condition characterized by decreased bone density and increased bone fragility. This increases the risk of fractures, particularly in weight-bearing bones like the femur. The femoral neck, being a critical part of the hip joint, is particularly susceptible to fractures in individuals with osteoporosis.",Success
"A 40-year-old woman presents with severe shortness of breath. The patient is unable to provide a history due to her breathing difficulties. The patient’s roommate says that she came home and found her in this state. She also says that they both occasionally take sleeping pills to help them fall asleep. Physical examination reveals an obese female, dyspneic with diminished chest wall movements. The patient’s A-a gradient is calculated to be 10 mm Hg. Which of the following most likely accounts for this patient’s symptoms?",B,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a diagnosis of alveolar hypoventilation (Option B). Alveolar hypoventilation is characterized by inadequate ventilation of the lungs, leading to an increase in carbon dioxide levels and a decrease in oxygen levels in the blood. This can result in shortness of breath and diminished chest wall movements, as seen in this patient. The A-a gradient being only 10 mm Hg does not suggest a significant impairment in gas diffusion (Option C) or a significant shunt (Options D and E). Alveolar hypoperfusion (Option A) would typically result in a much higher A-a gradient, which is not the case here. The mention of sleeping pills could indicate an underlying cause of hypoventilation, such as respiratory depression from the medication.",Success
"A 74-year-old woman is brought to her primary care doctor by her adult son. The son says she has been very difficult at home and is ""losing it"". He seems very frustrated about her diminishing ability to take care of herself the way she used to and no longer thinks he can trust her watching his children. At her last visit you noted mild cognitive impairment. Today, she appears withdrawn and hesitates to make eye-contact with you. She lets her son do most of the talking. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",E,"The most appropriate next step in this situation is to ask the son to step out so you can speak with the patient alone (Option E). This will allow the doctor to directly assess the patient's mental state, symptoms, and concerns without the influence or presence of her son, which could potentially alter her responses or make her feel uncomfortable. This private conversation can help determine if there are any changes in her condition, if she is experiencing any distress or abuse, and if there are any new symptoms that need to be addressed. Following this, the doctor can then proceed to assess her risk for depression (Option C) and possibly complete a mini-mental exam (Option B) to better understand her cognitive status. Ordering a head CT (Option D) might be considered if there are specific neurological symptoms or signs of acute deterioration, but it is not the first step in this scenario. Discussing the challenges of having a parent with dementia with the son (Option A) is also important but should be done after the patient's condition has been properly assessed and addressed.",Success
"An investigator is studying the effects of different gastrointestinal regulatory substances. A healthy subject is asked to eat a meal at hour 0, and the pH of stomach contents and rate of stomach acid secretions are measured over the next 4 hours. Results of the study are shown. Which of the following mechanisms most likely contributes to the changes seen at point D in the graph?",B,"To answer this question, let's first analyze the information given. The investigator is studying the effects of different gastrointestinal regulatory substances on a healthy subject. The subject eats a meal at hour 0, and the pH of stomach contents and the rate of stomach acid secretion are measured over the next 4 hours. The question asks about the mechanism that most likely contributes to the changes seen at point D in the graph.

Unfortunately, the graph is not provided in this text-based format, but based on the context, we can infer that point D represents a significant change in either stomach pH or the rate of stomach acid secretion.

Let's evaluate each option based on what we know about gastrointestinal regulation:

A. Increased vagal stimulation: The vagus nerve stimulates the release of gastric acid and increases the motility of the stomach. However, if point D represents a decrease in stomach acid secretion or an increase in pH, this option is less likely.

B. Increased activity of D cells: D cells secrete somatostatin, which inhibits the release of gastrin and other hormones that stimulate gastric acid secretion. If point D shows a decrease in stomach acid secretion or an increase in pH, this option could be a contributing factor.

C. Increased activation of H2 receptors: H2 receptors, when activated, stimulate the release of gastric acid. If point D shows an increase in stomach acid secretion or a decrease in pH, this option could be a contributing factor. However, if point D shows the opposite, this option is less likely.

D. Increased activity of enterochromaffin-like cells: ECL cells secrete histamine, which stimulates gastric acid secretion through the activation of H2 receptors. If point D shows an increase in stomach acid secretion or a decrease in pH, this option could be a contributing factor. However, if point D shows the opposite, this option is less likely.

E. Increased activity of I cells: I cells secrete secretin, which inhibits gastric acid secretion and stimulates bicarbonate secretion in the duodenum. If point D shows a decrease in stomach acid secretion or an increase in pH, this option could be a contributing factor.

Based on the options provided, the most likely mechanism contributing to the changes seen at point D (assuming it shows a decrease in stomach acid secretion or an increase in pH) would be either increased activity of D cells (option B) or increased activity of I cells (option E).

Without the specific details of the graph, it's difficult to determine which of these two options is the most likely. However, if we had to choose, we might lean towards option E (increased activity of I cells) because secretin is known to have a more direct effect on decreasing gastric acid secretion and increasing pH in the stomach.",Success
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician with a lump on her throat that has steadily increased in size over the past 5 months. She does not have difficulties swallowing, dyspnea, or changes in voice. Examination shows a 3-cm, hard swelling on the left side of her neck that moves with swallowing. There is no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Thyroid functions tests are within the reference range. Ultrasound of the neck shows an irregular, hypoechogenic mass in the left lobe of the thyroid. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is inconclusive. The surgeon and patient agree that the most appropriate next step is a diagnostic lobectomy and isthmectomy. Surgery shows a 3.5-cm gray tan thyroid tumor with invasion of surrounding blood vessels, including the veins. The specimen is sent for histopathological examination. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on microscopic examination of the mass?",B,"The most likely finding on microscopic examination of the mass, given the description of the clinical presentation and the histopathological features mentioned, is B. Capsular invasion. The presence of a hard, irregular, hypoechogenic mass with invasion of surrounding blood vessels suggests a malignant process. Capsular invasion is a characteristic feature of thyroid malignancies, particularly papillary thyroid carcinoma, which is known for its tendency to invade the thyroid capsule and adjacent structures. Psammoma bodies (Option C) are also often associated with papillary thyroid carcinoma, but capsular invasion is more directly related to the described clinical and imaging findings. Orphan Annie nuclei (Option E) are a characteristic feature of papillary thyroid carcinoma, but capsular invasion is a more direct indicator of malignancy in this context. Options A and D are less likely given the clinical scenario.",Success

Further diagnostic mammography and biopsy reveal ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Which of the following is the most important factor in determining this patient’s prognosis?",B,"The most important factor in determining this patient’s prognosis is B. Tumor stage. The stage of breast cancer is a significant determinant of prognosis, as it reflects the extent of the disease and can guide treatment decisions. Staging is based on the size of the tumor, whether lymph nodes are involved, and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Lower stages generally have a better prognosis than higher stages.",Success
"A 2-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her concerned father. He states that ever since her uncomplicated delivery she has failed to gain weight, has had chronic diarrhea, and has had multiple bacterial and viral infections. During the course of the workup, an absent thymic shadow is noted and a lymph node biopsy demonstrates the absence of germinal centers. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",C,"The patient's symptoms of failure to thrive, chronic diarrhea, and recurrent infections along with the absence of a thymic shadow and germinal centers in lymph node biopsy suggest a primary immunodeficiency disorder. The absence of the thymic shadow is particularly concerning as the thymus is responsible for the maturation of T-cells, which are critical for the immune response.

The absence of germinal centers in lymph node biopsies suggests a defect in B-cell function, as germinal centers are sites of B-cell proliferation and maturation.

Given these findings, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is:

C. Adenosine deaminase deficiency

Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that results in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). It affects both T-cell and B-cell function and can lead to the symptoms described. ADA deficiency results in the accumulation of toxic metabolites that damage lymphocytes, leading to a severe reduction in T-cell and B-cell numbers and function.

The other options are less likely:
A. Defect in WASP gene - This causes Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which can result in immunodeficiency but usually presents with a different constellation of symptoms, including eczema and thrombocytopenia.
B. Defect in ATM gene - This is associated with ataxia-telangiectasia, which can cause immunodeficiency but typically presents with neurological symptoms and dilated blood vessels in the eyes and skin.
D. NADPH oxidase deficiency - This causes chronic granulomatous disease, which primarily affects the function of phagocytes, not T-cells or B-cells.
E. Defect in BTK gene - This causes X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which affects B-cell function but typically does not present with the absence of a thymic shadow or T-cell dysfunction.",Success

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?",B,"The most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition is B. Gonadectomy. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a diagnosis of androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), which is a condition where an individual has a normal female phenotype but has a 46,XY karyotype and is resistant to androgens. The lack of a uterus and ovaries on ultrasonography, the presence of inguinal masses (likely undescended testes), and the lack of menstrual periods are all indicative of AIS. Gonadectomy is recommended to prevent the risk of gonadal malignancy and to prevent the production of androgens that the patient is unable to utilize.

Which of the following is most likely to show up on her iron profile?",D,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath with exertion, thinning hair, cool extremities, and flattened nail beds suggest a possible iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is common in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis due to chronic inflammation, poor dietary intake, and potential blood loss.

In iron deficiency anemia, the iron profile typically shows:
- Low ferritin levels (option B), as ferritin is the main storage form of iron in the body.
- Low serum iron levels.
- Increased total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) or transferrin saturation (option A), because the body is trying to compensate for the low iron levels by increasing the capacity to bind and transport iron.

Therefore, the most likely finding on her iron profile would be low ferritin levels (option B). Increased iron-binding capacity (option A) might also be present, but the primary and most definitive indicator of iron deficiency is low ferritin levels.",Success

This is because the patient presents with symptoms of diarrhea, weakness, and vomiting, which are consistent with a Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). CDI is a common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, especially in older adults who have been on antibiotics or have recently been in a healthcare setting. Given the patient's recent travel and potential exposure to antibiotics (either prescribed for herself or encountered in the community), CDI is a likely diagnosis to consider.

Performing a CT scan of the abdomen (Option B) might be indicated if there are signs of an abdominal emergency or if the C. difficile assay is negative and other causes of the symptoms are being considered. However, it is not the initial step in managing this patient's symptoms.

Measuring serum drug concentration (Option D) could be relevant if there is a suspicion of drug toxicity or interaction, but the symptoms described are more indicative of an infectious process than drug toxicity.

Administering oral activated charcoal (Option E) is not typically indicated in the management of diarrhea or dehydration, and it would not be the first-line approach for this patient's symptoms.

Hemodialysis (Option A) is not indicated based on the laboratory values provided.

"A 62-year-old man presents with episodes of palpitations for the past 3 weeks. He says that he has episodes where he feels his heart is ‘racing and pounding’, lasting 1–2 hours on average. Initially, he says the episodes would happen 1–2 times per week but now happen almost every day. This last episode has been constant for the past 2 days. He denies any seizure, loss of consciousness, dizziness, chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is significant for an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, status post intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with still some residual neurologic impairment, and long-standing gastroesophageal reflux secondary to a hiatal hernia, managed medically. The patient reports a 15-pack-year smoking history, but no alcohol or recreational drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. On physical examination, muscle strength in the lower extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right, along with sensory loss on the left, all of which is improved from his previous exam 3 weeks ago. There is a loss of the left half of the visual field bilaterally which is stable from the previous exam. Cardiac examination is significant for a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm. No rubs, thrills or murmurs. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan shows evidence of an area of infarction in the vicinity of the right anterior cerebral artery showing normal interval change with no evidence of new hemorrhage or expansion of the area of infarction. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed, which is shown in the exhibit (see image below). Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) in this patient?",D,"The ECG shown in the exhibit is not provided in the text, but based on the patient's symptoms of palpitations, racing heart, and the new-onset irregular rate and rhythm, it is likely that the patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is a common cardiac arrhythmia, especially in patients with a history of stroke, and it significantly increases the risk of future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) due to the formation of thrombi in the atria that can embolize to the brain.

Given the patient's history of an ischemic stroke and the likely diagnosis of AF, the most appropriate intervention to prevent future CVAs would be to start anticoagulation therapy. Among the options provided, options D and E involve anticoagulation therapy. Option D suggests starting both warfarin and heparin, which could be an initial approach to bridge the patient with heparin while waiting for the warfarin to achieve therapeutic levels. However, the question seems to be asking for the most appropriate long-term intervention, which would be option E: Begin warfarin.

Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that reduces the risk of stroke in patients with AF by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. It is effective in preventing stroke in patients with AF and is often the treatment of choice, especially in those with a history of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).

Options A and B, aspirin and clopidogrel, respectively, are antiplatelet agents that may be used in patients with AF who are at lower risk for stroke or in those for whom anticoagulation is contraindicated. However, they are generally less effective than anticoagulants like warfarin in preventing stroke in AF patients.

Option C, carotid endarterectomy, is a surgical procedure to remove plaque from the carotid arteries and is not indicated in this patient, as there is no mention of carotid artery stenosis or indication that the patient's stroke was due to carotid artery disease.

Therefore, the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future cerebrovascular accidents in this patient is to begin warfarin (option E).",Success
"In 2005, a group of researchers believed that prophylactically removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) in BRCA-mutation positive women would reduce the chance that they developed breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, they reviewed a database of women who were known to be BRCA-mutation positive and divided the group into those with breast cancer and those without breast cancer. They used data in the registry and surveys about peoples’ surgical history to compare the proportion of each population that had undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Based on this data, they reported that women undergoing the procedure had a lower chance of developing breast cancer later in life with an odds ratio of 0.46. This is an example of what type of study design?",D,"The study design described in the question is an example of a **D. Case-control** study. In this type of study, researchers identify individuals with a particular outcome (in this case, breast cancer) and compare them with individuals without that outcome. They then look back to determine the exposure (in this case, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) of each group to assess if the exposure is associated with the outcome. The odds ratio of 0.46 suggests that women who underwent the procedure had a lower odds of developing breast cancer compared to those who did not undergo the procedure.",Success
"A 64-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus is referred to a urologist. The patient has had pain when urinating and difficulty starting a stream of urine for over 4 months now. He is bothered because he has to urinate about 9 times every day, including several times when he wakes up at night. A digital rectal examination revealed multiple hard nodules in the prostate gland. A CT scan shows a nodule in the right lung that measures 3 cm. An ultrasound scan of his urinary bladder and prostate shows residual urine of > 200 mL and heterogeneous findings of the prostate gland. Biopsy reveals grade 2 prostate adenocarcinoma. Follow-up 9 months later shows his prostate cancer is well controlled with goserelin. If one considers pulmonary nodules that are the same size as this patient’s, which of the following additional findings on CT scans would most likely prompt the removal of such nodules?",D,"The presence of a subsolid component (Option C) in a pulmonary nodule on a CT scan would most likely prompt the removal of such nodules. Subsolid nodules, particularly those with a ground-glass opacity component, are more commonly associated with adenocarcinomas and have a higher risk of malignancy compared to solid nodules. This characteristic can be an indicator of early-stage lung cancer, and surgical intervention may be recommended for further evaluation and treatment.",Success
"A 35-year-old man presents with a 7 month history of insomnia. The patient admitted to having trouble sleeping from a young age but became more aware of how much this is affecting his health after attending a sleep conference earlier this year. He is worried that his health has suffered because of this, and he is also concerned that he will not be able to pay his bills if he were to get sick. He has no past medical or psychiatric condition and is not known to use any recreational drugs. The patient arrived for his appointment an hour early because he was afraid he might miss it. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals an irritable middle age man who is tense and somewhat inattentive during the interview. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
 ",A,"The most likely diagnosis in this patient is A. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The patient's symptoms of chronic insomnia, worry about health and financial stability, and his behavior of arriving an hour early for his appointment due to fear of missing it, all suggest a pattern of excessive anxiety and worry that is characteristic of GAD. Additionally, the patient's physical examination findings of irritability, tension, and inattentiveness during the interview further support this diagnosis. The absence of any past medical or psychiatric conditions and the lack of recreational drug use also make GAD the most likely diagnosis among the options given.",Success
A 3-year-old girl is brought to the cardiologist because of sweating and respiratory distress while eating. She is at the 30th percentile for height and 15th percentile for weight. Echocardiography shows a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum and a moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. Physical examination is most likely to show which of the following findings?,A,"The most likely finding on physical examination in a child with a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum, also known as a ventricular septal defect (VSD), would be a systolic murmur. This murmur is typically heard due to the increased flow across the defect during systole. The murmur can increase with maneuvers that increase the pressure gradient across the defect, such as hand clenching. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A. Systolic murmur that increases with hand clenching",Success
"A 58-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath and a nonproductive cough for the last week. Three weeks ago, he had a fever and a cough for 6 days after he returned from a trip to Southeast Asia. He has had a 4-kg (9-lb) weight loss over the past 3 months. He has bronchial asthma and hypertension. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 41 years. Current medications include an albuterol inhaler and enalapril. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 136/89 mm Hg. There is dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and decreased tactile fremitus over the left lung base. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Chest x-ray of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?",E,"The patient's history, symptoms, and physical examination findings suggest a possible lower respiratory tract infection or malignancy, given his recent travel to Southeast Asia, weight loss, and smoking history. The dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and decreased tactile fremitus over the left lung base are indicative of a consolidation or effusion, which could be seen in pneumonia, lung cancer, or other conditions affecting the lung.

Of the options provided, the most likely finding on a chest x-ray in this patient would be:

E. Blunting of costophrenic angle

Blunting of the costophrenic angle is typically seen when there is fluid or consolidation in the lower lung fields, which would explain the physical examination findings. This could be due to pneumonia, pleural effusion, or other conditions causing consolidation in the lung.

A. Elevation of diaphragm could be seen in conditions like a diaphragmatic hernia or with lung collapse, but it is less specific to the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

B. Ground glass appearance is typically seen in conditions like interstitial lung disease, pulmonary edema, or viral pneumonia, which does not fit as well with the patient's physical examination findings of decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion.

C. Widened intercostal spaces can be seen in conditions like pulmonary emphysema, but this is less likely given the patient's acute symptoms and examination findings.

D. Deep sulcus sign is associated with bronchopulmonary segmental atelectasis, which is less likely given the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

"A 58-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of sudden-onset right-sided body numbness for 1 hour. He reports that he has a 15-year history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. He is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. Neurological examination shows decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature on the right side of the face and body. Motor strength is 5/5 and deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Perfusion of which of the following structures of the brain is most likely impaired in this patient?",E,"The symptoms described in the patient are consistent with a stroke affecting the left side of the brain, given that the symptoms are on the right side of the body. The patient has right-sided body numbness, which indicates a sensory deficit. Sensory information from the body is processed in the contralateral (opposite) side of the brain. The parietal lobe is responsible for processing sensory information, but the question asks for the specific structure whose perfusion is most likely impaired.

The posterior limb of the internal capsule (option B) is a critical pathway for both motor and sensory information traveling to and from the cerebral cortex. It contains fibers from the spinothalamic tract and the dorsal columns-medial lemniscal pathway, which carry sensory information to the thalamus and then to the parietal lobe for processing. A stroke affecting this area would lead to sensory deficits similar to those described in the patient.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

B. Posterior limb of the internal capsule",Success
"A 9-year-old boy is brought in by his mother because of bruising on his torso and limbs. The patient’s mother denies any other symptoms and says he is otherwise healthy. Physical examination shows multiple petechiae and bruising on the torso and extremities bilaterally. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A complete blood count is normal. His coagulation profile reveals:
Prothrombin time (PT) 12 sec
Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 60 sec
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",D,"The most likely diagnosis in this patient is Hemophilia A (Option E). The prolonged aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) is indicative of a deficiency in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, which is characteristic of Hemophilia A. Hemophilia A is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of clotting factor VIII, leading to prolonged bleeding and easy bruising. The normal prothrombin time (PT) suggests that the extrinsic pathway and common pathway of coagulation are intact, which further supports the diagnosis of Hemophilia A over other disorders that might affect multiple pathways.",Success
"A 31-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-week history of a painless lump near the left wrist and tingling pain over his left hand. Physical examination shows a transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist. There is decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand. The tingling pain is aggravated by tapping over the swelling. Which of the following adjacent structures is at risk of entrapment if this mass persists?",C,"The symptoms and examination findings suggest that the mass near the left wrist is causing compression of the median nerve, which is responsible for sensation in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger. The mass is located on the lateral volar aspect of the wrist, which is consistent with the area where the median nerve runs. The tingling pain that is aggravated by tapping over the swelling is also indicative of nerve entrapment, specifically Tinel's sign, which is often associated with nerve compression.

Therefore, the adjacent structure at risk of entrapment if this mass persists is the median nerve, which is not listed in the options provided. However, based on the information given, the closest structure at risk from the options provided is not directly the median nerve but a structure in close proximity to it. Since the median nerve runs deep to the flexor carpi radialis tendon in the wrist, the answer that best fits the scenario is:

D. Flexor carpi radialis tendon

However, it is important to note that the primary concern here is the median nerve, which is not directly listed among the options.",Success
"A 52-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painless right-sided scrotal swelling. The swelling started several weeks ago but is not always present. Physical examination shows an 8-cm, soft, cystic nontender right-sided scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?",A,"The most likely cause of the mass described is B. Failure of processus vaginalis to obliterate. This scenario is indicative of a hydrocele, which is a collection of fluid in the tunica vaginalis surrounding the testicle. The processus vaginalis is a hernial sac that normally closes off after the testicle descends into the scrotum. If it fails to close completely, fluid can accumulate, forming a hydrocele. The fact that the mass is soft, cystic, nontender, and transilluminates supports this diagnosis. The mass not increasing in size on coughing and the absence of bowel sounds within the mass also suggest it is not a hernia, which would be consistent with options C (Extension of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal) and would likely show some response to coughing or changes in position.",Success
"A 40-year-old patient is brought into the emergency department after suffering a motor vehicle crash where he was pinned underneath his motorcycle for about 30 minutes before a passerby called 911. While evaluating him per your institution's trauma guidelines, you discover pain upon palpation of his right lower extremity which is much larger than his left counterpart. The patient admits to decreased sensation over his right lower extremity and cannot move his leg. There are no palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses on this extremity, and it is colder and paler in comparison to his left side. Measured compartment pressure of his distal right leg is 35 mm Hg. What is the next best step in this patient's care?",A,"Given the clinical scenario, the patient is likely suffering from compartment syndrome, which is a surgical emergency. Compartment syndrome occurs when the pressure within the muscle compartment increases to a level that compromises blood flow and can lead to muscle and nerve damage. The signs and symptoms described (pain, decreased sensation, absence of pulses, pallor, and coldness) are consistent with this diagnosis. The measured compartment pressure of 35 mm Hg is also indicative of compartment syndrome, as pressures above 30 mm Hg are generally considered to be indicative of the need for intervention.

The next best step in this patient's care is:

A. Emergent fasciotomy

Fasciotomy involves the surgical incision into the fascia to relieve pressure and prevent further damage to the muscles and nerves within the compartment. This procedure is critical in managing compartment syndrome to prevent permanent damage, muscle necrosis, and potential limb loss. The other options listed do not address the immediate need to relieve compartment pressure and are not the first-line interventions for compartment syndrome.",Success
An 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of fever and a pruritic rash that started on his trunk and then progressed to his face and extremities.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,B,"Based on the description and the fact that the rash started on the trunk and spread to the face and extremities, the most likely diagnosis is B. Varicella (chickenpox). This is a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which typically presents with a pruritic rash that begins on the trunk and spreads to the face and extremities. The rash goes through several stages, from red spots to blisters and then scabs. The fact that the child has not been vaccinated and has a fever also supports this diagnosis.",Success
"A 43-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after his son found him vomiting bright red blood. He is visibly intoxicated, and hospital records indicate a long history of alcohol substance abuse treated with antabuse (disulfiram). Vital signs include T 98.4, HR 89, BP 154/92, and RR 20. EGD is notable for mild esophagitis, and a longitudinal esophageal tear at the gastroesophageal junction, with no active bleeding. What is the next best course of action?",B,"The next best course of action in this scenario is A. Cyanoacrylate injection and ligation with banding, IV fluid hydration, and NPO (nothing by mouth). This approach is appropriate because the patient has a longitudinal esophageal tear at the gastroesophageal junction, which is likely a Mallory-Weiss tear, a condition often associated with severe vomiting, particularly in individuals with a history of alcohol abuse. Cyanoacrylate injection can help seal the tear, and band ligation can be used to manage any bleeding. IV fluid hydration is necessary to correct any volume loss from vomiting and to maintain hemodynamic stability. Keeping the patient NPO helps to prevent further stress on the esophagus and allows for healing.",Success
A medical student is preparing a patient for an appendectomy. He is asked by the surgeon to disinfect the patient’s skin with a chlorhexidine-isopropyl alcohol solution before the procedure. Recent studies have shown that this solution substantially reduces the risk of surgical site infections compared with a povidone-iodine preparation without alcohol in clean-contaminated surgery. Which of the following mechanisms best describes the mechanism of action of chlorhexidine?,E,"The mechanism of action of chlorhexidine that best describes its effectiveness is:

A. Bactericidal at low concentrations

Chlorhexidine is a cationic surface-active agent that is bactericidal at low concentrations. It acts by disrupting the cell membrane of bacteria, leading to cell death. Its effectiveness is not significantly reduced by the presence of organic matter, making it suitable for use in surgical settings where there may be blood or other organic substances present. Chlorhexidine is also known for its substantivity, meaning it continues to exert antimicrobial effects even after being rinsed off, providing prolonged protection against bacterial regrowth.

While some of the other options may describe mechanisms of action for other antimicrobial agents, they do not specifically apply to chlorhexidine. For example, protein coagulation/denaturation (option B) is a mechanism of action for phenolic disinfectants, and cell wall damage by free radical release (option C) is a mechanism for certain antiseptics like hydrogen peroxide. Attack of free-sulfur amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids within the bacteria (option D) is a mechanism for some antibiotics, and the activity depending on pH and being reduced in the presence of organic matter (option E) describes the limitations of some other antiseptics, like povidone-iodine.",Success
"A 19-year-old man with a past medical history significant only for facial acne presents with increased inguinal pruritis. Relevant social history includes participation in school wrestling.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is B. Tinea cruris, also known as jock itch. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Tinea cruris is a fungal infection that typically affects the groin area, inner thighs, and buttocks. It is common in athletes, especially those who engage in contact sports like wrestling, due to the warm, moist environment that promotes fungal growth. The erythematous, well-demarcated patch described in the patient's presentation is characteristic of this condition. The fact that the scrotum is spared also supports this diagnosis, as Tinea cruris tends to spare the scrotum.",Success

"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-week history of burning sensation in his mouth. One year ago, a peripheral blood smear performed during workup of fatigue revealed erythrocytes without central pallor. His father had gallstones, for which he underwent a cholecystectomy at the age of 26 years. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes, mild scleral icterus, a swollen, red tongue, and several mouth ulcers. There is darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles. His spleen is enlarged and palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.1 gm/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 104 μm3, and a reticulocyte count of 9%. Which of the following would most likely have prevented this patient's oropharyngeal symptoms?",E,"The patient's symptoms, including pallor of the mucosal membranes, mild scleral icterus, a swollen red tongue, mouth ulcers, darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles, and an enlarged spleen, along with the laboratory findings of a low hemoglobin concentration, high mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and high reticulocyte count, are indicative of hemolytic anemia. The history of erythrocytes without central pallor in the past and the family history of gallstones also suggest a possible hemolytic process.

The high MCV suggests a megaloblastic anemia, which can be caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. However, the high reticulocyte count indicates that the bone marrow is responding appropriately to the anemia, which is not typically seen in folate deficiency. The presence of mouth ulcers and a swollen, red tongue are also consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency.

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely cause of his oropharyngeal symptoms is vitamin B12 deficiency, which can lead to glossitis (swollen, red tongue) and stomatitis (mouth ulcers). Therefore, the treatment that would most likely have prevented these symptoms is:

D. Vitamin B12 injections

Vitamin B12 injections would correct the vitamin B12 deficiency, leading to improvement in the patient's anemia and resolution of his oropharyngeal symptoms.",Success
An experimental new drug in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 was found to increase the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation at the endothelium. This further increased glucose-dependent insulin production. Which of the following drugs has a mechanism of action most similar to this new experimental drug?,B,"The mechanism of action described in the question refers to a drug that increases the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation, leading to increased glucose-dependent insulin production. This description matches the mechanism of action of DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) inhibitors. DPP-4 is the enzyme responsible for the degradation of incretin hormones, such as GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). By inhibiting DPP-4, these drugs increase the levels of active incretins, which then stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner.

Among the options provided, sitagliptin (option B) is a DPP-4 inhibitor and has the mechanism of action most similar to the experimental drug described in the question. Exenatide (option A) is an incretin mimetic that acts as a GLP-1 receptor agonist, directly stimulating insulin secretion and inhibiting glucagon secretion, but it does not inhibit DPP-4. Glimepiride (option C) is a sulfonylurea that stimulates insulin secretion by binding to and closing ATP-sensitive potassium channels on pancreatic beta cells, leading to depolarization and insulin release. Canagliflozin (option D) is an SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitor that reduces blood glucose by increasing urinary glucose excretion. Pioglitazone (option E) is a thiazolidinedione that increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Sitagliptin.",Success
"A 60-year-old man with severe persistent asthma since the age of 14 presents with an acute exacerbation of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing over the last several days. His asthmatic symptoms are usually well controlled with regular high-dose inhaled triamcinolone, but over the last week or so he has developed a nocturnal cough and mild wheezing despite good compliance with controller medications. A review of several spirometry reports suggest of bronchial asthma with a partial irreversible airway obstruction. Which of the following is most likely to be associated with the recent loss of asthma control in this patient?",C,"The most likely cause of the recent loss of asthma control in this patient is C. Airway remodeling. Airway remodeling is a structural change in the airways that can occur in chronic asthma and can lead to a partial irreversible airway obstruction. This process can involve thickening of the airway walls, increased smooth muscle mass, and changes in the extracellular matrix, which can all contribute to a loss of control over asthma symptoms. Airway inflammation (D) and airway hyperresponsiveness (E) are also important factors in asthma, but airway remodeling is more likely to be associated with the development of irreversible airway obstruction.",Success
"A 75-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of a 3-day history of a productive cough and shortness of breath. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F) and respirations are 32/min. Crackles are heard over the right upper and the entire left lung fields. Sputum culture confirms infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Despite appropriate therapy, the patient dies. A photomicrograph of a section of the lung obtained during the autopsy is shown. Which of the following mediators is most likely responsible for the presence of the cell-type indicated by the arrow?",B,"The cell indicated by the arrow in the photomicrograph is a neutrophil, which is a type of white blood cell that plays a critical role in the innate immune response to bacterial infections. Among the options given, the mediator most likely responsible for the recruitment and activation of neutrophils in the context of a bacterial infection such as Streptococcus pneumoniae is platelet-activating factor (PAF), which is option B.

Platelet-activating factor is a potent phospholipid mediator that is involved in the inflammatory response. It is released by a variety of cells, including platelets, macrophages, and neutrophils themselves, in response to infection or tissue injury. PAF acts on neutrophils, causing their activation and chemotaxis to the site of infection or inflammation. It also increases the permeability of blood vessels, allowing neutrophils to migrate from the bloodstream into the affected tissue.

While other options such as leukotriene D4 (option E) can also contribute to the inflammatory response and neutrophil recruitment, platelet-activating factor is a more direct and potent mediator of neutrophil activation and chemotaxis in the context of bacterial pneumonia.

Immunoglobulin E (option A) is involved in allergic responses and parasitic infections, not bacterial infections. Interferon-gamma (option C) and interleukin-10 (option D) are cytokines that play roles in the adaptive immune response and immune regulation, respectively, but are not the primary mediators responsible for the immediate recruitment and activation of neutrophils in response to bacterial infection.",Success

Otherwise, he says that he has been getting tired easily and feels cold often. Physical exam reveals a painful diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with many small nodules. A biopsy is obtained showing diffuse cellular hyperplasia with areas of focal colloid hyperplasia. Given these findings, the patient is started on appropriate therapy, and the neck mass becomes smaller over time. Which of the following is most likely associated with the cause of this patient's symptoms?",C,"The patient's symptoms and the biopsy findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the infiltration of the thyroid gland by lymphocytes and macrophages, leading to thyroid dysfunction and goiter. The presence of diffuse cellular hyperplasia with areas of focal colloid hyperplasia on biopsy is typical of this condition. Among the options provided, the most likely associated cause is:

A. HLA-B8 risk factor

Hashimoto's thyroiditis is associated with certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, including HLA-B8, which is part of the HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR4 haplotypes. These genetic factors increase the risk of developing autoimmune thyroid diseases.

Increased 131-iodine uptake (Option B) is typically seen in conditions like Graves' disease, not Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Iodine deficiency (Option C) can lead to goiter but is not typically associated with the specific biopsy findings described. Presence of embryological remnant (Option D) would suggest a thyroglossal duct cyst or similar developmental anomaly, which would not fit the biopsy findings. Proliferation of fibroinflammatory cells (Option E) is seen in Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but it is not a cause of the disease; rather, it is a result of the autoimmune process.",Success

The absence of Anti-HBs (Hepatitis B surface antibody) further supports this diagnosis, as this antibody typically appears later in the course of infection or after recovery and indicates immunity. The negative results for other hepatitis viruses (HAV, HCV, HDV) and the absence of Anti-HAV IgM (Hepatitis A IgM antibody) exclude acute hepatitis A and D superinfection.

Antibodies directed against phospholipids, which is indicative of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). This is a common complication in patients with SLE and is characterized by recurrent thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity.

"A 22-year-old woman with a history of asthma visits her physician for worsening shortness of breath. She states that she feels as though her “lungs are falling apart,” noting that her lung function has been steadily deteriorating. She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from “random” bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, “Yes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.” She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/70 mm Hg, pulse 66/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base. There are also branched radiodensities that the radiologist notes as being “glove-finger shadows” (noted by the arrow in the image). Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are elevated. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy in this patient?",D,"The patient's history and presentation are most consistent with a diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus species, which is a common mold. The symptoms of worsening shortness of breath, excessive coughing, wheezing, and the production of greenish sputum with specks of red are characteristic of ABPA. The presence of fever, malaise, and the expectoration of brown mucous plugs further support this diagnosis. The chest radiograph showing atelectasis and ""glove-finger shadows"" (mucoid impaction) is also typical for ABPA. Elevated serum IgE levels are also commonly seen in ABPA.

The most appropriate therapy for ABPA is corticosteroids, such as prednisone (Option D), which help to reduce inflammation and improve symptoms. Antifungal therapy (Options B and C) is not the first-line treatment for ABPA, although it may be used in certain cases to eradicate Aspergillus colonization. Isoniazid (Option A) is used to treat tuberculosis, which is not indicated in this case. Surgical resection of the infiltrates (Option E) is not typically indicated for ABPA unless there is a complication such as a lung abscess or a fungus ball.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

D. Prednisone",Success
"A 30-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with complaints of fever (41.5℃ (106.7℉)) and diarrhea for the past 12 hours. There is no history of headaches, vomiting, or loss of consciousness. The past medical history is unobtainable due to a language barrier (the patient recently immigrated from abroad), but his wife says her husband had a motor vehicle accident when he was a teenager that required surgery. He is transferred to the ICU after a few hours in the ED because of dyspnea, cyanosis, and near-collapse. There are no signs of a meningeal infection. The Blood pressure was 70/30 mm Hg at the time of transfer. A chest X-ray at the time of admission showed interstitial infiltrates without homogeneous opacities. The initial laboratory results reveal metabolic acidosis, leukopenia with a count of 2,000/mm³, thrombocytopenia (15,000/mm³), and a coagulation profile suggestive of disseminated coagulation. A peripheral smear was performed and is shown below. Despite ventilatory support, administration of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressor agents, the patient died the next day. A gram stain from an autopsy specimen of the lungs revealed gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains. Which of the following organisms is most likely?",C,"The organism most likely responsible for the patient's condition is C. Streptococcus pneumoniae. The description of the gram stain showing gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains is characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae. This bacterium is a common cause of pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis, which can lead to the severe symptoms described in the patient, including fever, diarrhea, dyspnea, cyanosis, and near-collapse. The interstitial infiltrates seen on the chest X-ray are also consistent with pneumonia. The coagulation profile and thrombocytopenia suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can occur in severe bacterial infections, including those caused by S. pneumoniae.",Success
"A 12-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department 3 hours after the sudden onset of colicky abdominal pain and vomiting. The patient also manifests symptoms of redness and swelling of the face and lips without pruritus. Her symptoms began following a tooth extraction earlier in the morning. She had a similar episode of facial swelling after a bicycle accident 1 year ago, which resolved within 48 hours without treatment. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a nontender facial edema, erythema of the oral mucosa, and an enlarged tongue. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation over the lower quadrants. An abdominal ultrasound shows segmental thickening of the intestinal wall. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",B,"The most likely cause of this patient's condition is B. Complement inhibitor deficiency, specifically C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, which is a hallmark of hereditary angioedema (HAE). The symptoms of sudden onset of colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and facial swelling, particularly after a physical trauma like a tooth extraction, along with a history of similar episodes, suggest HAE. The absence of pruritus rules out typical allergic reactions (E. Mast-cell activation) that involve histamine release. The abdominal ultrasound showing segmental thickening of the intestinal wall is also consistent with HAE, which can cause angioedema of the intestinal mucosa leading to abdominal pain.",Success
"A healthy 21-year-old man undergoes physical fitness testing prior to long-term submarine deployment.

"A 3-day-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a 4-hour history of somnolence, poor feeding, and one episode of vomiting. He is exclusively breastfed. His serum glucose concentration is 88 mg/dL and his serum ammonia concentration is 850 μmol/L (N<90). Urinalysis shows an increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio. Urinary ketones are absent. This patient is most likely deficient in an enzyme that catalyzes which of the following reactions?",A,"The patient's symptoms, along with the laboratory findings of an elevated serum ammonia concentration and an increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio in the urine, suggest a disorder in the urea cycle. The urea cycle is responsible for the conversion of ammonia, which is toxic at high levels, into urea for excretion. The increased orotic acid suggests a block in the conversion of carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline, leading to the accumulation of orotic acid and its subsequent excretion in the urine.

The reaction that converts ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline is catalyzed by the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase. A deficiency in this enzyme would lead to the clinical presentation described, as it would block the urea cycle at this step, resulting in the accumulation of ammonia and the increased production of orotic acid.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A. Ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline",Success

Physical examination shows hyperreflexia. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass. This adnexal mass is most likely derived from which of the following cell types?",B,"Based on the information provided, the most likely cell type from which the adnexal mass is derived is:

A. Ovarian epithelial cells

The presence of a hypoechoic adnexal mass in a woman with pelvic pain, irregular menses, and weight loss suggests a possible ovarian tumor. Ovarian epithelial tumors are the most common type of ovarian tumors and can present with symptoms such as those described. The other options are less likely given the patient's symptoms and the characteristics of the mass. Germ cell tumors can also occur in the ovary, but they are less common and typically present in younger women. Chorionic epithelial cells are associated with pregnancy-related conditions, which is unlikely given the negative pregnancy test. Endometrial and stromal cell tumors would not typically present as an adnexal mass.",Success
"A 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department with the complaint of pain in his right toe for the past hour. The pain is so severe that it woke him up.

Needle-shaped birefringent crystals are observed in the joint aspirate. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient’s condition?",A,"The most likely underlying cause of the patient’s condition, given the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, is the presence of needle-shaped birefringent crystals in the joint aspirate. These crystals are characteristic of gout, a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in and around the joints. The high white blood cell count in the synovial fluid (30,000 cells/µL) and the negative culture also support the diagnosis of gout rather than an infectious arthritis.

Among the provided options, the one that most directly relates to the pathogenesis of gout is:

D. Deficiency of HGPRT (Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase)

HGPRT is an enzyme involved in the purine salvage pathway. A deficiency in this enzyme can lead to increased production of uric acid, which can result in hyperuricemia and subsequent gout. However, it is important to note that while a deficiency in HGPRT is a known cause of hyperuricemia (as seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome), it is a rare genetic condition and is not the most common cause of gout in the general population. More commonly, gout is associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity, alcohol consumption, high purine diet, and renal dysfunction affecting urate excretion.

The patient’s history of smoking, alcohol consumption, and occupation as a long-distance truck driver (which may involve a sedentary lifestyle and irregular diet) are all potential contributing factors to his condition. However, the specific cause of his gout in this scenario is most directly related to the presence of urate crystals in his joint, which is consistent with a deficiency in HGPRT or other factors leading to hyperuricemia.",Success
"A 33-year-old man presents to the infectious diseases clinic for follow-up. He was recently admitted to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and cough, and was found to have Pneumocystic jirovecii pneumonia and a new diagnosis of HIV. His CD4 count is 175, viral load is pending. As part of routine laboratory studies given his new diagnosis, an RPR was found to be positive with a titer of 1:64, and this is confirmed with a positive FTA-ABS. He is unsure when or how he acquired HIV or syphilis. His neurological examination is normal, and he has no symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management:",C,"Given the patient's positive RPR titer of 1:64 and confirmation with a positive FTA-ABS, he has a diagnosis of syphilis. The patient's CD4 count is 175, which is indicative of advanced HIV disease. The presence of HIV significantly alters the approach to syphilis management due to the increased risk of neurosyphilis and the potential for atypical presentations of syphilis.

The most appropriate next step in management for this patient is:

A. Perform lumbar puncture, treat based on presence or absence of CNS disease

The rationale for this choice is that HIV-positive patients with syphilis are at higher risk for neurosyphilis, regardless of the stage of syphilis or the presence of neurological symptoms. A lumbar puncture (LP) should be performed to evaluate for neurosyphilis, which is defined by the presence of abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, such as elevated white blood cell count, elevated protein, or reactive CSF Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test.

If the LP shows evidence of neurosyphilis, the patient should be treated with aqueous crystalline penicillin G, 2.4 million units intravenously every four hours for 14 days, or procaine penicillin G, 2.4 million units intramuscularly daily for 14 days, plus probenecid 500 mg orally four times daily for 14 days.

If the LP does not show evidence of neurosyphilis, the patient should be treated with 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin G intramuscularly once weekly for three weeks. Follow-up RPR titers should be obtained at 3 months to monitor for treatment response and to ensure that the titers are declining appropriately.

It is important to note that the other options (B, C, D, and E) do not include the critical step of performing a lumbar puncture to evaluate for neurosyphilis, which is essential in HIV-positive patients with syphilis.",Success

"A 29-year-old woman presents to her OB/GYN for a preconception visit. She wishes to become pregnant within the next several months. A thorough history reveals that the patient suffers from phenylketonuria (PKU). She recalls being instructed by prior physicians to follow a diet that avoids certain foods; however, she admits to not being complaint with these recommendations. Laboratory testing reveals a plasma phenylalanine level of 20.2 mg/dL (normal range <2 mg/dL). Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient?",C,"The most appropriate response to this patient is:

C. 3 months prior to conception, begin a restricted diet to lower phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL

This is because women with PKU need to maintain strict control over their phenylalanine levels before and during pregnancy to prevent serious birth defects. A phenylalanine-restricted diet should be initiated well before conception to achieve and maintain target levels, ideally below 6 mg/dL, to minimize the risk of adverse outcomes for the fetus.",Success
"A 47-year-old man presents to his family physician with a sudden onset of severe pain and redness in his eyes that started this morning. He is having difficulty seeing properly and is extremely worried about losing his vision. Further history reveals that he has had progressive lower back pain for over 2 months now. The pain is usually at its worst in the morning, but it remains throughout the day. It gets better with movement, however, so he tends to do some light exercises every day. He also has heel pain and feels significant pressure while walking. Laboratory analysis reveals increased ESR and CRP serum levels. Which of the following would most likely be seen in this patient?",D,"Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is seronegative spondyloarthropathy, specifically ankylosing spondylitis. The patient's symptoms of lower back pain that worsens in the morning and improves with movement, heel pain, and the presence of conjunctivitis along with elevated ESR and CRP levels are consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Conjunctivitis. 

Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, causing pain and stiffness. It can also affect other joints, such as the hips and knees, and can lead to complications such as uveitis (inflammation of the eye) and aortic regurgitation.

"A 38-year-old woman presents to her physician’s clinic for recurrent episodes of chest pain that wakes her from her sleep. While usually occurring late at night, she has also had similar pains during the day at random times, most recently while sitting at her desk in her office and at other times while doing the dishes at home. The pain lasts 10–15 minutes and resolves spontaneously. She is unable to identify any common preceding event to pain onset. The remainder of her history is unremarkable and she takes no regular medications. She works as an accountant. There is no history of smoking or drug use, however, she does consume 5 alcoholic drinks per week. Examination reveals: pulse 70/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg. A physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following would be effective in reducing her symptoms?",C,"The symptoms described are most consistent with a diagnosis of variant angina, also known as Prinzmetal's angina. This type of angina is characterized by episodes of chest pain due to coronary artery vasospasm, which can occur at rest and is often worse at night. The pain typically lasts for 10-15 minutes and resolves spontaneously. Given the absence of exertion or other obvious triggers, and the fact that the pain occurs at rest, this diagnosis is more likely than stable angina.

The treatment of choice for variant angina is a calcium channel blocker, which helps to prevent coronary artery vasospasm. However, among the options given, isosorbide dinitrate (Option C) is the most appropriate choice. Isosorbide dinitrate is a nitrate that dilates the coronary arteries, which can help to prevent the vasospasm that occurs in variant angina. It is often used in combination with a calcium channel blocker for optimal control of symptoms.

Options A, B, D, and E are not the first-line treatment for variant angina:
A. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent and is used to prevent blood clots, but it does not address the vasospasm that causes variant angina.
B. Digoxin is used to treat heart failure and atrial fibrillation, not variant angina.
D. Heparin is an anticoagulant used to prevent blood clots, not to treat variant angina.
E. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that is used to treat hypertension, angina, and other conditions, but it is not the first-line treatment for variant angina and can potentially worsen vasospasm in this condition.

The tonsils are not notably enlarged. Laboratory work-up shows an elevated lymphocyte count, atypical lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear, and a positive heterophile antibody screen. Which of the following is the best management of this patient's condition?",A,"The patient's presentation is consistent with infectious mononucleosis, often caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The management of infectious mononucleosis typically involves supportive care, as the condition is self-limiting and antibiotics are not effective against viral infections. Therefore, the best management for this patient is:

A. Bed rest and activity limitation

This will help the patient to conserve energy and allow the immune system to fight the infection. Activity should be limited to avoid complications such as splenic rupture, which is a rare but serious complication of infectious mononucleosis due to splenomegaly. The patient should be advised to avoid contact sports and strenuous activities until the spleen has returned to normal size, which can take several weeks.

Options B, C, and D (Acyclovir, Ganciclovir, and Amoxicillin) are not recommended as they are antiviral or antibiotic medications that do not have a significant role in the treatment of infectious mononucleosis caused by EBV. Acyclovir and Ganciclovir are used for herpes simplex and herpes zoster infections, and Amoxicillin is an antibiotic used for bacterial infections. Amoxicillin can also cause a rash in patients with infectious mononucleosis, which may be mistaken for a drug allergy.

Option E (Prednisone) is a corticosteroid that may be used in rare cases of infectious mononucleosis to relieve severe symptoms such as airway obstruction or significant swelling of the tonsils.

The patient's symptoms of increased thirst, frequent urination, and dehydration, along with his laboratory results, suggest a diagnosis of hyperosmolality due to osmotic diuresis. The high serum osmolality (354 mOsm/kg) and the high urine osmolality (400 mOsm/kg) are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's high blood glucose level, as indicated by his elevated Hemoglobin A1C (10.5%), may be contributing to the osmotic diuresis.

The physician informs the patient that she is ""pre-diabetic"" or at risk of developing diabetes and recommends lifestyle modification with follow-up in 6 months. Which of the following endogenous signaling molecules or receptors will increase insulin sensitivity in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma). Activation of PPAR gamma receptors increases insulin sensitivity and is the mechanism of action for the class of antidiabetic drugs known as thiazolidinediones (TZDs), such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone. PPAR gamma agonists enhance the action of insulin on target tissues, such as muscle and adipose tissue, improving glucose uptake and reducing insulin resistance. This can be beneficial in patients who are pre-diabetic or have type 2 diabetes.

A. Catecholamines (such as epinephrine and norepinephrine) generally increase blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver and decreasing glucose uptake in muscle and fat tissues.

B. Glucagon is a hormone that increases blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver.

C. Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, increase blood glucose levels by promoting gluconeogenesis and decreasing glucose uptake in muscle and fat tissues.

E. TNF-alpha (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha) is a cytokine that can contribute to insulin resistance and inflammation in conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.",Success

What is the most likely cause of hemoptysis and hematuria in this patient?",E,"The most likely cause of hemoptysis and hematuria in this patient is related to the presence of anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies (Option E). This condition is known as Goodpasture syndrome, which is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of anti-GBM antibodies that attack the lungs and kidneys. The antibodies cause inflammation and damage to the basement membranes of the alveoli in the lungs and the glomeruli in the kidneys, leading to symptoms such as hemoptysis (coughing up blood) and hematuria (blood in the urine).

He is a veteran who returned from a deployment to Afghanistan 2 years ago. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,A,"The most likely diagnosis for this patient is A. Major depressive disorder. The symptoms described, including difficulty concentrating, fatigue, speaking more slowly, decreased appetite, and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, are consistent with major depressive disorder. The patient's history as a veteran who returned from a deployment to Afghanistan 2 years ago is also relevant, as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can present with depressive symptoms.

Extraocular movements are intact. Mild ptosis is noted bilaterally but worse on the left. A visual acuity test reveals no abnormalities. Which of the following medications is most appropriate in the management of this patient?",A,"The patient's symptoms of double vision, worsening in the evenings, and fatigue, along with her physical examination findings of mild ptosis worse on the left, are suggestive of myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of any of the muscles under voluntary control, and it often affects the muscles that control eye and eyelid movement, leading to symptoms such as double vision and ptosis.

Among the options provided, Pyridostigmine (Option A) is the most appropriate medication for the management of this patient. Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases the levels of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions, thereby improving muscle strength in patients with myasthenia gravis.

Physostigmine (Option B) is also an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor but is typically used for the treatment of myasthenia gravis in acute settings or for diagnostic testing with the edrophonium (Tensilon) test, and it has a shorter duration of action compared to pyridostigmine.

Edrophonium (Option C) is used for the Tensilon test to diagnose myasthenia gravis but is not a treatment option.

Hydrocortisone (Option D) and Azathioprine (Option E) are immunosuppressants that may be used in the management of myasthenia gravis, especially in cases where acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are not sufficient. However, they are not the first-line treatment and are typically used in more severe or refractory cases.

Heart exam shows no abnormalities other than irregular beats. To assess adherence and therapeutic efficacy in this patient, which of the following studies should be ordered?",C,"The correct answer is C. International normalized ratio (INR). 

The patient is taking warfarin, which is an anticoagulant that requires monitoring of its therapeutic effect and potential toxicity. The INR is the test used to monitor the effectiveness of warfarin therapy. It measures how long it takes for the blood to clot compared to a normal clotting time. The INR should be within a target range, which is typically between 2.0 and 3.0 for patients with atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke while minimizing the risk of bleeding. Therefore, ordering an INR test would be the most appropriate choice to assess adherence and therapeutic efficacy in this patient. 

The other options are not as relevant to the patient's current situation. An echocardiogram and electrocardiogram may be useful in evaluating cardiac structure and function, but they are not necessary for monitoring the patient's current treatment regimen.

Physically, he is also found to be significantly overweight with hypogonadism. Notably, the boy was limp when he was born and did not have a normal motor response to stimuli. Elevated levels of a gastrointestinal hormone are associated with the cause of this patient's weight gain. The hormone that is most responsible for causing the weight gain is produced in which of the following cell types?",D,"The hormone that is most responsible for causing the weight gain in this patient is likely to be ghrelin, which is produced by the P/D1 cells in the stomach. Ghrelin is a gastrointestinal hormone that stimulates appetite and is often referred to as the ""hunger hormone."" It is involved in the regulation of energy balance by increasing food intake and promoting fat storage. In conditions where ghrelin levels are elevated, such as in Prader-Willi syndrome (which matches the clinical presentation described), there is an increased risk of obesity due to excessive food intake. Therefore, the correct answer is D. P/D1 cells.",Success
"Accurate and rapid identification of individuals with tuberculosis (TB) is crucial to accomplishing the goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to eliminate this disease. One of the key strategies for the detection of TB is the use of tuberculin skin testing as a globally pertinent screening method, due to its low cost and technical simplicity. A study from Brazil demonstrated 76.7% accuracy, 67.9% sensitivity, 84.4% specificity, 79.1% positive predictive value, and 75% negative predictive value when using 5-mm skin elevation as a threshold, or cut-off, point for the screening test (following intradermal injection). Lowering the cut-off point to 4 mm would also result in an increase in which test property?",D,"Lowering the cut-off point to 4 mm would result in an increase in:

B. Sensitivity

Explanation: Lowering the cut-off point for a screening test such as the tuberculin skin test will typically increase the sensitivity of the test. Sensitivity refers to the test's ability to correctly identify those with the disease (true positives). By lowering the cut-off point, more individuals will test positive, including more true positives, thereby increasing sensitivity. However, this also increases the number of false positives, which decreases specificity and may also negatively impact the positive predictive value (PPV) if the prevalence of the disease is low. The negative predictive value (NPV) may increase if the test is being used in a population with a low prevalence of the disease, as more people will test negative, and more of those will be true negatives. Convergent and discriminant validity are not directly related to the cut-off point of a screening test.",Success
"A 55-year-old caucasian male is transferred to a tertiary care hospital from a small county hospital where he presented with jaundice and severe abdominal pain that radiates to the back. While in the county hospital, he did not develop fever, and his vital signs were stable for the 48 hours he spent at there. Initial laboratory tests are given below:
Total bilirubin 7 mg/dL
Direct bilirubin 6.4 mg/dL
AST 100
ALT 40
Alkaline phosphatase 480 IU/L
Glucose 160 mg/dL
The patient’s medical history is relevant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus. He admits to smoking cigarettes since his early teenage years. Moderate icterus is evident during physical examination, the abdomen is distended and dull to percussion, and there is periumbilical tenderness. Which of the following markers would you expect to be elevated in this patient?",E,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are suggestive of a biliary obstruction, which can be caused by a variety of conditions including gallstones, biliary strictures, or pancreatic cancer. Among the markers listed, CA 19-9 (E) is the one that would be most likely to be elevated in this patient. CA 19-9 is a tumor marker that is often elevated in patients with pancreatic, biliary, and other gastrointestinal cancers. It is not specific for any one diagnosis but can be helpful in the evaluation of patients with suspected biliary obstruction or pancreatic disease.",Success
"A one-week-old, full-term infant born by uncomplicated vaginal delivery is brought to a pediatrician by his mother, who notes that her daughter's skin appears yellow. She reports that the child cries several times per day and sleeps 7-8 hours at night, uninterrupted. She has been breastfeeding exclusively and feels that he has been feeding well. Which of the following is the best treatment for this condition?",E,"The condition described in the question is neonatal jaundice, which is common in newborns and is characterized by yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes due to high levels of bilirubin in the blood. In most cases, this condition is benign and resolves on its own as the infant's liver matures and is able to process bilirubin more effectively. However, in some cases, treatment is necessary to prevent complications such as kernicterus, a type of brain damage.

The best treatment for neonatal jaundice depends on the severity of the condition and the level of bilirubin in the infant's blood. For mild to moderate cases, phototherapy is often the treatment of choice. Phototherapy involves exposing the infant to special blue light, which helps to break down bilirubin in the skin so that it can be eliminated from the body through urine and stool. In severe cases, where the bilirubin level is very high, exchange transfusion (plasma exchange) may be necessary to rapidly reduce the bilirubin level.

In this case, since the infant is one week old and appears to be feeding well, the most appropriate initial treatment would be phototherapy (option A). This is a safe and effective treatment for neonatal jaundice that can be administered in a hospital or clinic setting. It is important to note that continuing normal breastfeeding (option E) is also recommended, as breastfeeding can help to stimulate the infant's bowel movements and promote the elimination of bilirubin from the body. However, in cases of severe jaundice, phototherapy or exchange transfusion may be necessary in addition to breastfeeding.

Phenobarbital administration (option B) is not typically used to treat neonatal jaundice. Phenobarbital is a sedative and anticonvulsant medication that is sometimes used to treat seizures in infants, but it is not a standard treatment for jaundice. Switching from breast milk to formula (option D) is also not a recommended treatment for neonatal jaundice, as breastfeeding is generally considered to be the best source of nutrition for infants and does not contribute to the development of jaundice. Plasma exchange (option C) is a more invasive treatment that is reserved for cases of severe jaundice where the bilirubin level is very high and there is a risk of complications such as kernicterus.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman arrives to the clinic complaining of progressive urinary leakage that has occurred for the past 1 year. At first, she would notice leakage only during athletic exercise, but now the incontinence occurs even when she laughs or coughs. The patient states that she goes to the bathroom more frequently to try to prevent “wetting myself.” She wakes up once a night to urinate. She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she “needs to focus.” The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use. Pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable. When that patient is asked to Valsalva, leakage of urine is observed. A urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?",D,"The most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms is D. Urethral hypermobility. This condition, also known as stress urinary incontinence, is characterized by involuntary leakage of urine during physical exertion, sneezing, coughing, or laughing. The patient's history of vaginal delivery and the progression of symptoms from only occurring during exercise to happening during other activities like laughing or coughing are consistent with this diagnosis. The observation of urine leakage during the Valsalva maneuver further supports this diagnosis.

Options A (diabetic polyuria) and C (primary polydipsia) are not supported by the patient's history or symptoms. The patient does not have a history of diabetes, and her fluid intake is not excessive. Option B (overactive detrusor muscle) is less likely because the patient does not report urgency or frequency, which are common symptoms of this condition. Option E (vesicovaginal fistula) would typically present with continuous leakage of urine, which is not described by the patient.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after an episode of altered mental status. She was at a party when she suddenly fell to the floor. Her friends state that she was not responsive and was acting oddly. After the episode, the patient seemed confused and had no memory of the event. The patient has a past medical history of substance abuse, depression, and anxiety. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 117/69 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals a girl who seems confused and responds to questions slowly. Her gait is stable, and she demonstrates 5/5 strength in her upper and lower extremities. Laboratory values and a urine dipstick test are performed as seen below:

Toxicology:
Benzodiazepines: Positive
Marijuana: Positive
Cocaine: Negative
Phencyclidine: Negative

Urine Dipstick:
Appearance: Dark
Red blood cells: Positive
Glucose: Negative

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",C,"Given the patient's history of substance abuse, the positive toxicology screen for benzodiazepines and marijuana, and her altered mental status with no other significant findings on physical examination, the best next step in management would be:

E. Supportive therapy and observation

Supportive therapy would include monitoring her vital signs, ensuring she is in a safe environment, and providing any necessary supportive care such as oxygen or IV fluids if she is dehydrated. Observation is critical to assess for any changes in her mental status or the development of other symptoms that might indicate a more serious underlying condition.

It's important to note that the dark urine and positive red blood cells on the urine dipstick could indicate dehydration, hematuria, or other renal issues, which should also be investigated further. However, in the context of her acute presentation and toxicology results, supportive care and observation are the most appropriate initial steps.

Diazepam (option A) is a benzodiazepine and would not be appropriate to administer given her positive toxicology screen for benzodiazepines. Electroencephalography (option B) might be considered if there is a suspicion of seizures or other neurological issues, but it is not the first-line intervention in this scenario. IV fluids and mannitol (option C) might be necessary if there is evidence of cerebral edema or severe dehydration, but there is no indication for mannitol based on the information provided.

Where is most of the sodium reabsorbed in this patient’s kidneys?",D,"Most of the sodium reabsorbed in the kidneys is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D. Proximal tubule

In the proximal tubule, about 65-70% of the filtered sodium is reabsorbed, primarily through a sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE3) that is located on the apical membrane of the proximal tubule cells. This reabsorption is coupled with the reabsorption of other solutes, such as glucose and amino acids, and is critical for maintaining electrolyte balance and fluid homeostasis in the body. The other segments of the nephron (distal tubule, ascending and descending limbs of the loop of Henle, and collecting duct) also play roles in sodium reabsorption, but the proximal tubule is responsible for the majority of this process.",Success

Absence of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1. This enzyme is crucial for the conjugation of bilirubin, converting it from unconjugated (indirect) to conjugated (direct) bilirubin, which can then be excreted in the bile. The high levels of unconjugated bilirubin and the minimal amount of conjugated bilirubin in the lab results suggest a defect in this enzyme, leading to a condition known as Crigler-Najjar syndrome.

Urinalysis is positive for ketone bodies. What is the most appropriate immediate step in the management of this patient?",A,"The most appropriate immediate step in the management of this patient is:

A. Administer IV fluids and insulin

The patient's symptoms and lab results are indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body starts breaking down fat for energy because it is not getting enough glucose. This leads to the production of ketone bodies, which are acidic and can cause the blood pH to drop (acidosis). The patient's blood glucose level is extremely high (691 mg/dL), his blood pH is low (7.21), and there are ketone bodies in his urine, all of which are consistent with DKA.

The treatment for DKA involves rehydration with IV fluids to replace lost fluids and electrolytes, and the administration of insulin to lower blood glucose levels and stop the production of ketone bodies. The other options listed are not appropriate for the immediate management of DKA. Administering IV antibiotics (option B) is not indicated without evidence of infection. Oral antidiabetic medications (option C) are not effective in treating DKA and should not be given when the patient is severely dehydrated. Administering IV bicarbonate (option D) is not recommended as initial treatment for DKA as it can lead to complications such as cerebral edema. Potassium and magnesium (option E) may be necessary later in the treatment of DKA if there are electrolyte imbalances, but the immediate priority is to rehydrate the patient and lower the blood glucose level with insulin.",Success
"A 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department with chest pain. He reports that one hour ago he was climbing the stairs in his home when he suddenly developed excruciating chest pain.

They try to ask her what is wrong, but she does not respond and persists crying for approximately 20 minutes, after which she goes back to sleeping comfortably. Upon awaking the following morning, she has no recollection of the night's events. Which of the following is true about these episodes?",B,"The episodes described in the question are most likely ""night terrors,"" also known as ""pavor nocturnus."" Night terrors are a type of parasomnia, which is a category of sleep disorders. They are characterized by sudden arousal from non-REM sleep with intense fear and panic, often accompanied by screaming or crying. The child is usually unresponsive to attempts to calm them and typically does not remember the episode the next morning.

Given this information, the correct answer is:

B. They occur only during non-REM sleep

Night terrors typically occur during the first few hours of sleep, during the deepest stage of non-REM sleep (stage 3, also known as delta or slow-wave sleep). This is in contrast to nightmares, which occur during REM sleep and are often remembered upon waking.

It's important to note that night terrors are not associated with persistent episodes into adulthood (option A), as they tend to resolve on their own as the child grows older.

"A 50-year-old man comes to the physician because of swelling of his legs for 2 months. Three months ago, he was diagnosed with hypertension and started on a new medication. His blood pressure is 145/95 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 2+ edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. This patient was most likely treated with which of the following drugs?",E,"The patient's symptoms of leg swelling (edema) and the timing of its onset relative to the initiation of a new medication for hypertension suggest that the drug in question may be causing this side effect. Among the options provided, spironolactone (option C) is known to potentially cause edema as a side effect. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that blocks the action of aldosterone, a hormone that helps regulate blood pressure and water balance in the body. By blocking aldosterone, spironolactone can lead to an increase in potassium levels and sometimes fluid retention, which can manifest as edema, especially in the lower extremities.

Therefore, the most likely drug that this patient was treated with, based on the symptoms described, is spironolactone (option C).",Success
An investigator is studying the function of different enzymes in various human cell types. A subset of normal human cells with an elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase is harvested and isolated. Which of the following is most likely to be absent in these cells?,A,"The question is asking which enzyme is most likely to be absent in cells with an elevated concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase. Bisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme involved in the glycolytic pathway, specifically in the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to 3-phosphoglycerate. However, the presence of this enzyme does not directly suggest the absence of any other enzyme.

However, the options given are enzymes involved in different metabolic pathways:
A. α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is involved in the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle).
B. Pyruvate kinase is also involved in the glycolytic pathway.
C. Glutathione reductase is involved in the glutathione redox cycle, which is part of the cell's antioxidant defense system.
D. Lactic acid dehydrogenase is involved in the conversion of pyruvate to lactate during anaerobic glycolysis.
E. Carbonic anhydrase is involved in the reversible hydration of carbon dioxide and is important in pH regulation and CO2 transport in the blood.

Given the context, none of the enzymes listed would be directly affected by an increase in bisphosphoglycerate mutase activity. However, since the question asks which enzyme is most likely to be absent, we have to look for an enzyme that is not directly related to glycolysis or the cell's energy metabolism, as an increase in one enzyme does not typically lead to the absence of another.

Among the options, carbonic anhydrase (E) is the least likely to be directly affected by the metabolic pathway involving bisphosphoglycerate mutase. However, the question's phrasing is tricky, and the answer might be more about which enzyme's absence would be least expected to be detected as a result of elevated bisphosphoglycerate mutase levels. Since the presence of bisphosphoglycerate mutase does not logically lead to the absence of any of the enzymes listed, the answer might be more about which enzyme's presence or absence would not be directly related to the glycolytic pathway.

Given the options, **C. Glutathione reductase** might be the best answer, as its absence would not be directly related to the activity of bisphosphoglycerate mutase. However, this is a very nuanced question, and the context provided does not strongly suggest the absence of any of the enzymes listed. Therefore, the question might be considered poorly formulated for a clear-cut answer based on the given information.",Success
"A 28-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room after a motor vehicle accident. On arrival, she is stable and says that she hit a car at an intersection that ""came out of nowhere"". She states that she had similar close encounters with other cars these past few weeks but was able to avoid collisions with those. She has also had intermittent headaches over the last month and has noticed that her shirts have been getting wet unexpectedly. Blood tests reveal an abnormal elevation of a circulating substance. Which of following changes is also associated with the physiologic function of the most likely substance in this case?",B,"The patient's symptoms, including the unexpected wetting of her shirts and the close encounters with other cars due to a perceived lack of awareness, suggest a possible medical condition affecting her neurological and hormonal systems. The wetting of shirts could indicate excessive sweating or, more likely in this context, inappropriate lactation (galactorrhea) due to a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma. The intermittent headaches could also be related to this condition, as pituitary tumors can cause pressure on the surrounding structures, including the optic nerves, leading to visual disturbances and headaches.

The blood tests revealing an abnormal elevation of a circulating substance, combined with the clinical presentation, point to an increased level of prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates milk production in the breasts, and elevated levels can lead to galactorrhea and amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) in women.

The question asks for a change associated with the physiologic function of the most likely substance in this case, which is prolactin. Prolactin does not directly affect oxytocin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels. However, elevated prolactin levels can suppress the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turn can lead to decreased levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH. This can result in decreased progesterone production by the ovaries since progesterone is produced in response to LH surges during the menstrual cycle.

Therefore, the answer that best fits the scenario is:

E. Increased progesterone

However, this is a trick question because increased progesterone levels would not be expected in the context of a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma. The correct answer based on the information provided and the effects of elevated prolactin would be a decrease in progesterone levels due to the suppression of LH and FSH, but that option is not directly available. If we were to select the answer that most closely aligns with the physiological effects of elevated prolactin, it would be an option indicating decreased progesterone, which is not directly listed but can be inferred from option E being incorrectly stated as increased progesterone.",Success
"A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of episodic headaches associated with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Over-the-counter pain medications have failed to reduce her symptoms. An MRI of the brain shows isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle. This dilatation is most likely caused by blockade of which of the following structures?",B,"The isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle in this patient is most likely caused by a blockade of the cerebral aqueduct (Option E). The cerebral aqueduct, also known as the aqueduct of Sylvius, is a narrow channel that connects the third and fourth ventricles of the brain, allowing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the lateral ventricles (via the interventricular foramen) to the fourth ventricle. Blockage of this structure can lead to hydrocephalus, characterized by the accumulation of CSF and subsequent dilation of the ventricles. In this case, the left lateral ventricle is dilated, which suggests that the flow of CSF is obstructed at the level of the cerebral aqueduct or beyond, preventing the CSF from draining properly.",Success
"A 20-day-old child is brought to the emergency department by her parents. They are concerned about lethargy and easy bruising. Her mother reports that she has been eating less for the past few days. Today she was difficult to arouse. She normally nurses four-five times a day, but ate less yesterday and this morning. The girl was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery at home with minimal prenatal or postnatal care. This is her first visit to a physician of any type. The family is carefully questioned and child abuse is ruled out. The daughter’s pulse is 97/min, respirations are 35/min, temperature is 35.8°C (96.4°F), and blood pressure is 71/46 mm Hg. Physical examination shows diffuse petechiae and bruising. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",E,"The most likely cause of the symptoms described in this 20-day-old child, including lethargy, easy bruising, and petechiae, is Vitamin K deficiency (Option E). Newborns are at risk for vitamin K deficiency because vitamin K is poorly transferred across the placenta, and breast milk contains low levels of vitamin K. Without prophylactic vitamin K administration at birth, which is a standard practice in most countries, neonates can develop vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB), which can manifest as petechiae, bruising, and other bleeding symptoms. The child's history of minimal prenatal or postnatal care suggests that she may not have received the vitamin K prophylaxis at birth.",Success
"A 10-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a generalized, non-itchy rash for 2 days. He has also had a fever and sore throat for 4 days. He has not received any routine childhood vaccinations. Examination shows a flushed face except around his mouth. A diffuse, papular, erythematous rash that blanches with pressure is seen over the trunk. Pharyngeal erythema and a red beefy tongue are noted. His leukocyte count is 11,200/mm3 (75% segmented neutrophils, 22% lymphocytes). Without treatment, this patient's current condition puts him at greatest risk for which of the following complications?",D,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of scarlet fever, which is caused by group A Streptococcus (GAS) bacteria. Scarlet fever is characterized by a generalized, non-itchy rash, fever, sore throat, and a ""strawberry tongue"" (red beefy tongue). The flushed face except around the mouth is known as circumoral pallor, which is also a characteristic feature of scarlet fever.

Without treatment, the greatest risk for a patient with scarlet fever is the development of complications related to the underlying GAS infection. Among the options provided, the most likely complication is:

B. Coronary artery aneurysms

However, it is important to note that coronary artery aneurysms are more commonly associated with Kawasaki disease, not scarlet fever. In the context of scarlet fever, the more immediate and common complications include:

1. Suppurative complications: These include middle ear infection (otitis media), sinusitis, and lymphadenitis.
2. Nonsuppurative complications: These are related to the body's immune response to the GAS infection and include acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis.

Coronary artery aneurysms can occur in patients with untreated or severe cases of scarlet fever, but this is less common than in Kawasaki disease. The other options listed (hemolytic anemia, encephalitis, mitral valve regurgitation, and minimal change disease) are not typically complications of untreated scarlet fever. Therefore, while ""B. Coronary artery aneurysms"" is not the most common complication of scarlet fever, it is the closest option provided that could potentially occur in severe or untreated cases.",Success
"A 32-year-old man presents to the emergency department with fever, nausea, and vomiting. The patient states that his symptoms started last night and have persisted to this morning. He has a past medical history of asthma, and his current medications include albuterol and fluticasone. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 110/60 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, the patient seems uncomfortable. He requests that the lights in the room stay turned off during the physical exam. The patient's cardiac exam demonstrates a normal rate and rhythm, and his pulmonary exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Musculoskeletal exam reveals diminished mobility of the neck in all four directions, with flexion of the neck causing the patient discomfort. Lumbar puncture is performed and results are seen below.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF):
Cell count: 175/mm^3
Cl-: 119 mEq/L
Glucose: 49 mg/dL
Pressure: 150 mmH2O
Total protein: 55 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient's most likely diagnosis?",E,"Based on the patient's symptoms and the CSF analysis, the most likely diagnosis is bacterial meningitis. The CSF findings are consistent with bacterial meningitis, as indicated by the elevated white blood cell count (cell count: 175/mm^3), low glucose level (49 mg/dL), and elevated protein level (55 mg/dL). The normal chloride level (119 mEq/L) does not rule out bacterial meningitis.

The best initial treatment for bacterial meningitis is a combination of antibiotics that cover a broad spectrum of potential causative organisms. Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that is effective against many gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, making it a suitable choice for empirical treatment. Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is particularly effective against gram-positive bacteria, including those that are resistant to other antibiotics. The combination of ceftriaxone and vancomycin (Option D) is the best choice for initial treatment of bacterial meningitis until the specific causative organism can be identified and the appropriate antibiotic sensitivity profile determined.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

D. Ceftriaxone and vancomycin",Success

A photograph of his oral mucosa is shown. Indirect mirror examination of the posterior oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The photograph of the oral mucosa is not provided in the text, but based on the symptoms described and the patient's use of a high-dose combination salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler, the most likely diagnosis is oral candidiasis, also known as thrush. This condition is common in patients using inhaled corticosteroids due to the immunosuppressive effects of the medication.

The appropriate next step in management would be to prescribe an antifungal medication. Among the options given, both B. Fluconazole and D. Nystatin are antifungal medications. Fluconazole is a systemic antifungal, while Nystatin is typically used topically. For oral candidiasis, either could be appropriate, but Fluconazole is often preferred for its convenience of oral administration and effectiveness against Candida species.

Physical examination shows nontender cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. An x-ray of the chest shows bilateral mediastinal masses. Resection of a cervical lymph node is performed. A photomicrograph of the resected specimen is shown. Further histopathological examination is most likely to show which of the following findings?",B,"The photomicrograph is not provided in the text, but based on the clinical presentation and the description of the patient's symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is Hodgkin's lymphoma. The presence of fever, night sweats, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy, along with the finding of mediastinal masses on chest x-ray, are all consistent with this diagnosis. The resection of a cervical lymph node would be performed to obtain a tissue sample for histopathological examination.

Hodgkin's lymphoma is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are large, multinucleated cells that are typically positive for CD15 and CD30. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is:

B. Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30.

Examination shows upward slanting of the eyelids, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a single transverse palmar crease on both hands. The abdomen is soft and nontender. A 2.5-cm (1-inch) epigastric mass is palpated. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis is within normal limits. Further diagnostic evaluation of the patient is most likely to show which of the following?",D,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS), which is characterized by recurrent nonbilious vomiting, usually starting at around 4 to 6 weeks of age. The infant's symptoms, including vomiting immediately after feeds, irritability during feeding, and refusal to finish the bottle, are consistent with HPS. The presence of a palpable epigastric mass is also a common finding in infants with HPS. The fact that the infant has Down syndrome is not directly related to the cause of his symptoms, but it is important to note as part of his medical history.

The diagnostic evaluation that is most likely to confirm the diagnosis of HPS is an abdominal ultrasound, which can show an elongated and thickened pylorus (option D). This is the preferred method for diagnosing HPS because it is noninvasive, readily available, and highly accurate.

The other options are less likely to be relevant in this case:

A. Dilated colon segment on abdominal x-ray is more indicative of conditions like Hirschsprung disease, not HPS.
B. A high serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration would suggest congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which is not associated with the described symptoms.
C. Detection of rotavirus antigen on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) would indicate a viral gastroenteritis, which typically presents with diarrhea rather than vomiting.

"A 5-year-old Syrian immigrant and her family present for an immigration physical. Her mother describes photophobia, bilateral lacrimation, eye itching, and eyelid swelling for the last week. She is known to have an allergy to cephalosporins. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. She has met all of her developmental milestones and most of her vaccines. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 105/60 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 18/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). The physical examination is mostly normal except for her eye exam as presented in the image below. Which of the following statements is true regarding treatment of this patient’s condition?",D,"Based on the symptoms described, the child is most likely suffering from an allergic reaction or conjunctivitis, which is an inflammation or infection of the conjunctiva, the thin, clear tissue that lines the inside of the eyelid and covers the white part of the eye. The symptoms of photophobia, bilateral lacrimation (tearing), eye itching, and eyelid swelling are all consistent with this diagnosis. Given the patient's allergy to cephalosporins, options that include cephalosporins (A) are not appropriate.

Option B suggests treating with topical bacitracin, which is an antibiotic ointment commonly used to prevent infection in minor cuts, scrapes, and burns. While it could be used for certain types of bacterial conjunctivitis, it is not the first-line treatment for viral or allergic conjunctivitis.

Option C suggests oral tetracycline, which is not typically used in children under the age of 8 due to the risk of tooth discoloration and other side effects. It is also not the first-line treatment for conjunctivitis.

Option D suggests administering a single dose of oral azithromycin. Azithromycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can be used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, and it does not contain cephalosporins, making it a suitable choice given the patient's allergy. However, it is important to note that conjunctivitis can be caused by viruses, allergies, or bacteria, and treatment should be based on the underlying cause. If the conjunctivitis is viral or allergic, antibiotics like azithromycin would not be effective.

Option E suggests surgical resection, which is not appropriate for the treatment of conjunctivitis.

Given the information provided and assuming the cause of the conjunctivitis is bacterial, option D (administering a single dose of oral azithromycin) would be the most appropriate treatment option. However, it is crucial to confirm the diagnosis through a proper examination and possibly laboratory tests before initiating treatment. If the conjunctivitis is allergic in nature, treatment would likely involve antihistamines and possibly topical corticosteroids, rather than antibiotics.",Success

"A 45-year-old homeless man comes to the emergency department because of progressive neck pain for 3 days. He also reports headaches and numbness in both hands. Over the past 4 months, he has had intermittent lower back pain after waking up. The back pain improves with movement. He also has recurrent episodes of gout in the metatarsophalangeal joint of his right big toe. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years and drinks four beers daily. The patient is a known user of intravenous heroin. He appears acutely ill. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg.

Blood cultures are pending. An x-ray of the cervical spine shows no abnormalities. An MRI of the spine shows signs of inflammation. A bone biopsy confirms the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",B,"The most appropriate next step in management for this patient would be B. Intravenous ciprofloxacin and vancomycin therapy. Given the patient's history of intravenous drug use, high fever, elevated white blood cell count with a left shift, and localized pain and inflammation in the cervical spine region, there is a strong suspicion for a spinal infection such as osteomyelitis or epidural abscess. The MRI showing signs of inflammation and the bone biopsy confirming a diagnosis (which is not specified but likely an infection given the context) support this suspicion.

Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, while vancomycin is a potent antibiotic used primarily to treat serious infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is common in intravenous drug users. The combination of these two antibiotics provides broad coverage for potential pathogens causing the spinal infection.

A lumbar puncture (option A) could be considered if there were signs of meningitis or neurological involvement, but the priority here is to treat the suspected spinal infection. Surgical debridement (option C) might be necessary if there is evidence of an abscess or if medical therapy fails, but it is not the initial treatment of choice. Oral indomethacin therapy (option D) is an anti-inflammatory medication and would not be effective for treating an active infection. Bone scintigraphy (option E) is a diagnostic tool and would not be the next step in management once a diagnosis has been confirmed and the patient is acutely ill.",Success

Which of the following acid-base disturbances is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?",C,"The patient's condition is most consistent with pyloric stenosis, a condition characterized by thickening and narrowing of the pylorus, the passage between the stomach and the small intestine. This leads to vomiting after feedings, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalances. The acid-base disturbance most commonly associated with pyloric stenosis is metabolic alkalosis (Option C), due to the loss of gastric acid in the vomitus.

The pol gene encodes the viral enzymes reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase, which are crucial for the viral replication cycle. Mutations in this gene can lead to resistance against antiretroviral drugs, particularly those targeting these enzymes, such as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), and integrase inhibitors. The sudden increase in viral load and the clinical presentation suggest that the current HAART regimen is no longer effective due to viral resistance, which is often associated with pol gene mutations.",Success

The patient is referred to another physician for a more thorough workup including laboratory work and CT imaging. Which of the following is the best long-term prophylaxis for the cause of this patient’s acute symptoms?",A,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory values suggest a possible diagnosis of hypercalcemia, which can be caused by primary hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, or other conditions. The low PTH level (8 pg/mL) in the context of hypercalcemia (Ca2+: 12.2 mg/dL) is not typical for primary hyperparathyroidism, as PTH levels are usually elevated in that condition. However, the PTH level may be suppressed due to the high calcium levels, which is a negative feedback mechanism. Further workup, including CT imaging, would help to determine the cause of the hypercalcemia.

The best long-term prophylaxis for hypercalcemia would depend on the underlying cause. However, among the options provided, none directly address the immediate management of hypercalcemia. Alendronate (A) and teriparatide (E) are used for osteoporosis, calcitonin (B) can be used acutely to lower calcium levels but is not a long-term solution, and furosemide (C) is a diuretic that can be used to manage fluid overload but does not address hypercalcemia.

Given the options and the context of the question, the best answer for long-term prophylaxis would be related to managing the underlying cause of hypercalcemia. However, among the options provided, none directly address this. If we must choose the best option based on the information given, and considering that the question is asking for prophylaxis (prevention), the answer would be:

A. Alendronate

Alendronate is a bisphosphonate used to prevent and treat osteoporosis and other conditions characterized by bone loss. It can help reduce the risk of hypercalcemia in conditions where bone resorption is high, such as primary hyperparathyroidism, by inhibiting osteoclast activity and reducing bone turnover. However, it is important to note that alendronate is not a direct treatment for hypercalcemia but can be part of a long-term management strategy for conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia.",Success
"A 68-year-old woman is referred to the outpatient psychiatry clinic from the medical clinic. The patient is being treated for urge incontinence but is being referred for psychiatric evaluation to help with some of her old avoidance behavior. For the 3 months that she had her urinary symptoms, she avoided places like long lines and long train rides. Even after being successfully treated for her urinary condition, she continues to show restricted social interaction. Which of the following is a true statement regarding the patient's condition?",A,"The patient's symptoms are most consistent with a diagnosis of Specific Phobia, which is characterized by a persistent, irrational fear of, and avoidance of, a specific object or situation. The correct answer is A. She fears not being able to escape similar situations. This is a common symptom in specific phobia, particularly in situations where escape might be difficult or embarrassing, such as long lines or train rides.

Option B is incorrect because the symptoms need to last for at least 6 months, not 1 month, for a diagnosis of specific phobia.

Option C is partially correct but not the best answer because while only one fear or avoidance situation is required for the diagnosis, the question does not provide enough information to determine if this is the only situation the patient avoids.

Option D is correct, but it is not the best answer because the question does not provide enough information to determine if the patient has social phobia. However, it is true that patients with specific phobia may also have social phobia.

"A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department with dyspnea and palpitations. He does not smoke cigarettes or consume alcohol, and past medical history is insignificant. Blood pressure is 115/75 mmHG and heart rate is 125/min. Heart rhythm is irregularly irregular. After initial treatment with IV digoxin the patient's heart rate drops to 85/min and remains irregular. Which of the following best explains the effect of digoxin in this patient?",D,"The best explanation for the effect of digoxin in this patient is C. Blockade of Na-K-ATPase on cardiac myocytes.

Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that exerts its effects primarily by inhibiting the Na-K-ATPase pump in cardiac myocytes. This inhibition leads to an increase in intracellular sodium, which in turn increases intracellular calcium by activating the Na-Ca exchanger. Increased intracellular calcium enhances myocardial contractility, which can improve cardiac output in patients with heart failure. Additionally, digoxin has electrophysiological effects that can slow atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction and decrease the heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter, as seen in this case where the patient's heart rate dropped from 125/min to 85/min. However, the heart rhythm remained irregularly irregular, which suggests that digoxin did not convert the patient's atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm but rather controlled the ventricular rate.

Options A (blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors) and B (calcium channel blockade) are incorrect because digoxin does not have these mechanisms of action. Option D (vagal stimulation) is also not the primary mechanism of action for digoxin, although it can have vagal effects as a secondary effect of its action on the Na-K-ATPase. Option E (increased ventricular contractility) is a correct effect of digoxin, but it does not explain the reduction in heart rate observed in this patient.",Success

The Somogyi effect occurs when the body responds to low blood sugar during the night by releasing hormones that raise blood sugar levels, leading to high morning blood glucose levels.

Given this scenario, the optimal intervention is to adjust the insulin regimen to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia. This typically involves:

E. Reducing daily insulin dose

Reducing the insulin dose, especially the evening or basal insulin dose, can help prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia and thus avoid the rebound hyperglycemia in the morning. The patient should also be advised to monitor his blood glucose levels at bedtime and upon waking to better understand the pattern and adjust the insulin dose accordingly.

Options A, B, and C are not appropriate interventions for this condition. Adding diazepam (option B) is not indicated as it is a benzodiazepine used for anxiety and sleep disorders, not for managing diabetes. Adding pramlintide (option C) is also not the best choice as it is an amylin analog used to help control postprandial (after-meal) blood glucose levels and does not address the issue of nocturnal hypoglycemia. Increasing the daily insulin dose (option D) would exacerbate the problem of nocturnal hypoglycemia.",Success

Which of the following cardiac complications is her infant at high risk for?",B,"The infant of a mother with mitral stenosis is not necessarily at high risk for any specific cardiac defect listed in the options. However, among the options provided, Ebstein anomaly (D) is a congenital heart defect that can be associated with maternal diabetes, which the patient in question has. Maternal diabetes, particularly if poorly controlled, is associated with an increased risk of congenital heart defects in the offspring. Therefore, while the mother's mitral stenosis does not directly increase the risk of any of these specific cardiac complications in the infant, her diabetes does increase the risk of Ebstein anomaly, making option D the most appropriate answer given the context.",Success
"A 63-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint of back pain for the past 2 months. The pain is present throughout the day, and even at night when he lies down.

"An 18-year-old college student presents to the student health clinic complaining of excessive sleepiness. He first noticed the daytime sleepiness about a year ago but reports that it significantly worsened once he started college. He reports that he goes to bed around 9 p.m. and wakes up for class at 8 a.m.. He naps between classes for a total of 4 hours during the day. Despite this, he wakes up feeling exhausted. He easily falls asleep during class and while studying. This has started to affect both his academics and his social life. On weekends, he can sleep up to 20 hours a day. He reports 2 recent episodes of sudden generalized body weakness along with ptosis and difficulty speaking that occurred after he became angry. Each episode lasted about 10 seconds, but he says he felt back to normal within 15 minutes without any persistent deficits. His Epworth Sleepiness Scale score is 17. Which of the following is the best next step in therapy?",D,"The patient's symptoms are highly suggestive of narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), disrupted night-time sleep, and often vivid hallucinations upon falling asleep or waking. The episodes of sudden generalized body weakness, ptosis, and difficulty speaking that occur after becoming angry are indicative of cataplexy, a symptom typically associated with narcolepsy.

Given the patient's symptoms and Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 17 (indicating severe sleepiness), the next step in therapy should be aimed at managing his excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. Among the options provided, Modafinil (Option D) is the most appropriate choice for treating narcolepsy. Modafinil is a wakefulness-promoting agent that is commonly used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift work disorder. It has been shown to improve wakefulness and reduce the frequency of cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy.

Options A (Clomipramine), B (Dextroamphetamine), and C (Methylphenidate) are not the best initial choices for this patient. Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to treat cataplexy but is not typically the first-line treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy. Dextroamphetamine and Methylphenidate are stimulants that can also be used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy, but Modafinil is often preferred due to its more favorable side effect profile and lower potential for abuse.

Option E (Sleep deprivation) is not a therapeutic intervention for narcolepsy and would likely exacerbate the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the best next step in therapy for this patient is to initiate treatment with Modafinil.",Success
"A 63-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease complains of feeling lightheaded after her hemodialysis sessions for the past month. She worries she might eventually lose her balance and fall.

At the clinic, her blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg when lying down before dialysis and 110/55 mm Hg when seated after hemodialysis. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies after hemodialysis show a Hb of 10.5 mg/dL, a blood sugar of 189 mg/dL, and a hemoglobin A1C of 7.1%. To reduce the likelihood of falls, the most appropriate management is which of the following?",A,"The most appropriate management to reduce the likelihood of falls in this patient is to adjust the rate and amount of ultrafiltration during hemodialysis. This is because the patient is experiencing symptoms of post-dialysis hypotension, which can lead to lightheadedness and falls. Increasing ultrafiltration (Option D) is not the correct answer, as it would likely exacerbate the hypotension. Instead, the ultrafiltration should be managed more conservatively to prevent rapid changes in blood volume and pressure.

However, since ""decreasing ultrafiltration"" is not one of the options provided, the best choice among the given options to potentially help manage her symptoms would be:

A. Cooling the dialysate

Cooling the dialysate (Option A) can help reduce the risk of hypotension during dialysis by decreasing the likelihood of vasodilation, which is a common cause of intradialytic hypotension. This can help maintain blood pressure and reduce the risk of falls associated with lightheadedness. The other options (B, C, E) are not directly related to managing post-dialysis hypotension and are therefore less appropriate.",Success
"A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with a fever. She developed worsening malaise and diaphoresis over the past 48 hours. Her maximum temperature was 102°F (38.9°C) taken the night before presentation. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder, obesity, fibromyalgia, and severe tension headaches. She previously took paroxetine for a 2-month trial but switched to citalopram 6 months ago as she did not feel like paroxetine was adequately helping her symptoms. Her mood has been stable on her current dose of citalopram. She takes ibuprofen for her headaches but previously borrowed a friend’s headache medication when her headaches became very severe.

The patient's symptoms of fever, malaise, diaphoresis, and increased muscle tone with clonus can be indicative of Serotonin Syndrome, which can be caused by the use of certain medications that increase serotonin levels in the brain. The patient's recent switch from paroxetine to citalopram, both of which are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), increases her risk for developing Serotonin Syndrome, especially if she has also been taking other medications that increase serotonin levels, such as the amino acid supplement she recently started taking.

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",D,"The patient's symptoms of hemoptysis, diffuse muscle pain, and shortness of breath, combined with the physical examination findings of crackles in the lung bases and the laboratory results, suggest a possible diagnosis of Goodpasture syndrome or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). The high serum potassium (5.8 mEq/L) and elevated creatinine (2.6 mg/dL) indicate significant renal impairment, which is often seen in these conditions. The positive urine protein and blood tests also support the diagnosis of a renal pathology.

Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the laboratory findings, the most appropriate treatment would be a combination of immunosuppressive therapy and plasmapheresis to rapidly remove circulating autoantibodies that are likely contributing to the patient's condition. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D. Methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide

Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid that helps reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. Cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressive agent that can help control the autoimmune response. Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes and replaces the plasma in the blood, which can help remove circulating autoantibodies and other harmful substances from the patient's circulation, potentially preventing further damage to the lungs and kidneys.",Success

Physical exam is notable for tenderness over the patient's scalp, jaw, and temporal area. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",C,"The patient's presentation of severe headache, jaw pain exacerbated by chewing, and tenderness over the scalp, jaw, and temporal area raises suspicion for giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis. GCA is a systemic vasculitis that can lead to significant complications, including vision loss, if not promptly treated. Given the patient's age and symptoms, the best next step in management would be to initiate treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, which is not listed as an option but is implied by option C (IV steroids).

However, before initiating treatment, it is crucial to confirm the diagnosis, as the treatment for GCA can have significant side effects. A temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing GCA, and it should be performed if there is a high clinical suspicion, as indicated by the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the best next step in management would be to perform a temporal artery biopsy (option E) to confirm the diagnosis before initiating treatment.

It is important to note that in clinical practice, if GCA is strongly suspected based on the clinical presentation, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids should be initiated promptly to prevent potential vision loss, even before the results of the biopsy are available.

The patient is started on a new medication. One week later, serum studies show a hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 2,000/mm3 with 2% monocytes, and a platelet count of 56,000/mm3. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?",C,"The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest that she is experiencing myelosuppression, a common side effect of chemotherapy. Myelosuppression is the decrease in the production of blood cells by the bone marrow, which can lead to anemia (low hemoglobin), leukopenia (low white blood cell count), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). The question asks which of the listed drugs is most likely to cause the worsening of these findings. However, the drugs listed are actually used to counteract myelosuppression, not cause it. They are hematopoietic growth factors that stimulate the production of specific blood cells. Here is a brief explanation of each drug:

A. Aldesleukin is a form of interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine that stimulates the growth and activity of white blood cells. It is not typically used to treat myelosuppression caused by chemotherapy.

B. Interferon beta is used to treat multiple sclerosis and some viral diseases. It is not used to treat myelosuppression.

C. Filgrastim is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that stimulates the production of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell). It is commonly used to treat chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.

D. Romiplostim is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist that stimulates the production of platelets. It is used to treat thrombocytopenia.

E. Sargramostim is a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that stimulates the production of white blood cells. It is used to treat chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.

Given the worsening of the patient's blood counts, none of these drugs would be the cause of the findings, as they are intended to improve blood counts, not worsen them. However, if we must choose the drug that is least likely to improve the patient's blood counts, it would be Aldesleukin (option A), as it is not typically used to treat myelosuppression caused by chemotherapy.",Success

Given her recent travel history and the fact that she is pregnant (which is a risk factor for PE), the most appropriate next step in her evaluation would be to assess for the presence of a PE.

Option E, CT pulmonary angiogram, is the most sensitive and specific test for diagnosing pulmonary embolism. However, it involves radiation and contrast, which may be concerning in pregnancy. 

Option A, D-dimer, is a sensitive but non-specific test that can be used to rule out PE in low-risk patients. However, in pregnant women, D-dimer levels are often elevated due to the hypercoagulable state of pregnancy, which can lead to false-positive results. 

Option C, Chest radiography, may show signs of a PE but is not specific or sensitive enough to confirm the diagnosis.

Option B, ECG, may show signs of right heart strain in the setting of a PE but is not diagnostic.

Option D, V/Q scan, is a non-invasive test that can diagnose PE but is less sensitive and specific than CT pulmonary angiogram and also involves radiation.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and the need for a definitive diagnosis, the best next step would be to perform a D-dimer test (Option A) as an initial screening test. If the D-dimer is negative and the clinical suspicion is low, PE can be ruled out. If the D-dimer is positive or the clinical suspicion remains high despite a negative D-dimer, a CT pulmonary angiogram (Option E) should be considered with appropriate precautions for the fetus.

The widespread erythematous rash with skin peeling, high fever, tachycardia, and hypotension suggest a serious systemic condition. The elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), along with the mild elevation in bilirubin and creatinine, indicate liver and possible kidney involvement.

Option A, recent treatment with sulfonamides, is a plausible cause for her symptoms. Sulfonamides can cause severe drug reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis, which are characterized by a widespread rash, mucosal involvement, fever, and multi-organ dysfunction.

Colonoscopy with biopsy is later performed showing a neoplastic growth in the descending colon. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for his cardiac findings?",E,"The most likely explanation for the cardiac findings in this patient is related to his malignant colonic neoplasm (Option C). The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), which can be caused by a variety of bacteria, including viridans streptococci (Option A) and group D streptococci (Option E). However, the patient's history of a neoplastic growth in the descending colon, along with his symptoms of fever, fatigue, and weight loss, suggest that the endocarditis may be related to the malignancy.

Malignant tumors can lead to endocarditis through several mechanisms, including the introduction of bacteria into the bloodstream during procedures such as colonoscopies or due to the presence of a central venous catheter. In this case, the patient's colon cancer may have led to bacteremia, which then resulted in endocarditis. The high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur heard over the right upper sternal border is consistent with aortic valve regurgitation, which is a common complication of endocarditis. The head bobbing with each heartbeat (also known as Quincke's sign) and the petechiae on the lower extremities are also characteristic of endocarditis.

Treponema pallidum (Option B) is the causative agent of syphilis, which can lead to cardiovascular complications, including aortic valve regurgitation.

Thirty minutes after the first dose, the patient develops difficulty breathing, severe muscle pain, and vomiting. Her pulse rate is 120/min and the blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. Which of the following medications was most likely administered to the patient?",D,"Based on the symptoms and the context of the patient's condition, the most likely medication that was administered to the patient and caused the adverse reaction is:

D. Sargramostim

Sargramostim (Leukine) is a form of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) used to increase white blood cell counts in patients with certain cancers or undergoing bone marrow transplants. It can also be used in patients with HIV to increase white blood cell counts. However, sargramostim can cause side effects such as difficulty breathing, muscle pain, and vomiting, which are consistent with the symptoms described in the question. The drop in blood pressure and increased pulse rate are also indicative of a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis, which can occur with sargramostim administration.

The other options are less likely to cause the described symptoms:

A. Filgrastim is a form of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) used to increase neutrophil counts. It can cause bone pain but is less likely to cause the severe symptoms described.

B. Interleukin 3 is a cytokine that can stimulate the growth of hematopoietic cells but is not commonly used in clinical practice and is not typically associated with such severe reactions.

C. Platelet-derived growth factor is not typically used in clinical practice for blood cell stimulation.

E. Thrombopoietin is used to increase platelet counts and is less likely to cause the described symptoms, although it can cause side effects like headache and nausea.",Success
"A 77-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband because of increasing confusion and unusual behavior for 2 days. She has been mumbling to herself and wandering around the neighborhood. These symptoms are worse in the evenings and she has hardly slept at night. She has not been eating or drinking much for the past 6 days. She has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. She was diagnosed with breast cancer 12 years ago and was treated with left-sided mastectomy. The patient is oriented to person but not to place or time. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 78/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a supple neck. Neurologic examination shows psychomotor agitation. Attention and concentration are impaired; she makes multiple errors while performing the serial sevens test. Her speech is disorganized. Her fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 122 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The most appropriate next step in management would be to check serum electrolytes (Option C). Given the patient's history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, there is a risk of electrolyte imbalance which can contribute to confusion and altered mental status. Additionally, dehydration due to poor oral intake can also affect electrolyte levels and mental status. Checking serum electrolytes can help identify any imbalances that may be contributing to her symptoms. While other options such as performing a CT scan of the head, checking serum TSH level, performing a lumbar puncture, or performing a chest x-ray may be indicated based on further evaluation, checking serum electrolytes is a more immediate and direct step to address the patient's current presentation.",Success

The patient's symptoms, examination findings, and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of pyogenic liver abscess. The right upper quadrant ultrasound may also show findings suggestive of a liver abscess. Metronidazole is an antibiotic that is effective against anaerobic bacteria, which are common causes of liver abscesses.

A 57-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for follow-up of his diabetes. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 months ago and has been started on metformin and lifestyle modifications. The patient does not have any current complaints except for occasional numbness in both hands and feet. His HbA1C is 8.5% and serum glucose is 240 mg/dL. Which of the following is the best next step in this patient’s condition?,C,"Given the patient's HbA1C of 8.5% and serum glucose of 240 mg/dL, which are both above the target levels (HbA1C <7% and fasting plasma glucose <100 mg/dL for most patients with type 2 diabetes), it indicates that the current treatment with metformin and lifestyle modifications is not sufficient to control his diabetes. The patient also reports numbness in both hands and feet, which may be a sign of diabetic neuropathy, a complication of poorly controlled diabetes.

The next step in managing this patient's diabetes should aim to improve glycemic control. Among the options provided:

A. Starting basal-bolus insulin can be very effective in controlling blood glucose levels but may be more complex and requires more frequent monitoring and adjustments.

B. Continuing metformin monotherapy is not sufficient based on the current HbA1C and glucose levels.

C. Adding a sulfonylurea can be a good choice as it increases insulin secretion from the pancreas and can help lower blood glucose levels. This is a common next step in the treatment algorithm for type 2 diabetes when metformin alone is not enough.

D. Adding an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor can help lower postprandial glucose levels but may not be as effective as other options in significantly lowering the HbA1C.

E. Adding a thiazolidinedione can improve insulin sensitivity but has potential side effects, including weight gain and fluid retention, which may not be the best choice initially.

Considering the need for improved glycemic control and the potential for diabetic neuropathy, the best next step would be:

C. Add a sulfonylurea

This choice is supported by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines, which recommend adding a second medication, such as a sulfonylurea, when metformin monotherapy does not achieve target HbA1C levels.",Success
"A 42-year-old chronic alcoholic man was admitted to the hospital for inappropriate behavior and disturbed memory. He presents with severe retrograde memory loss, confusion, and confabulation. Neurologic examination showed horizontal nystagmus. He also has bilateral pretibial pitting edema and perioral erythema. CT studies of the brain were normal. The duty physician suspects the patient may be vitamin deficient. Which of the following reactions does the deficient vitamin mediate?",A,"The patient's symptoms and presentation are consistent with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a severe neurological disorder caused by a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), the active form of thiamine, is a coenzyme for several enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including those in the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle).

Among the reactions listed, the one that is directly mediated by thiamine (through its active form TPP) is:

A. Alpha-Ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA <=> Succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH

This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, which requires thiamine pyrophosphate as a coenzyme. Thiamine deficiency can lead to impaired activity of this enzyme, affecting the citric acid cycle and energy production in the body.",Success

The patient and her husband request a transfer to a more capable center. They are informed of the hospital’s obligations under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act and the risks of transfer. They insist to be transferred. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The most appropriate next step in management in this scenario is:

E. Transfer the patient only if the medical benefits of transfer outweigh the risks

According to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), a hospital must provide a medical screening examination to determine if an emergency medical condition exists. If an emergency medical condition is identified, the hospital must provide stabilizing treatment, and if the patient requests a transfer, the hospital must ensure that the transfer is medically appropriate and safe. In this case, the patient is in active labor and has experienced significant blood loss, which indicates a potentially life-threatening situation. The decision to transfer should be based on the medical benefits of transferring the patient to a facility better equipped to handle high-risk pregnancies versus the risks associated with the transfer, such as the potential for further complications during transport.

Before transferring the patient, the medical team should ensure that:

1. The patient is as stable as possible, given her condition.
2. A capable receiving facility is identified and agrees to accept the transfer.
3. Appropriate medical personnel and equipment are available for the transfer.
4. The patient and her husband understand the risks and benefits of the transfer and provide informed consent.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with asthma, which is often associated with eosinophilia and positive skin tests for allergens. Beta-2 antagonists, also known as beta-2 agonists, are commonly used to relieve bronchoconstriction in asthma and other obstructive airway diseases. They act by stimulating beta-2 adrenergic receptors on bronchial smooth muscle, leading to bronchodilation and relief of symptoms.",Success
A 16-year-old healthy female presents to her pediatrician concerned that she has not had a menstrual period. She has no past medical history and takes no medications. She plays volleyball and gets good grades in school. Her BMI is 22 kg/m2. Physical examination reveals normal female external genitalia and pubic hair along the mons pubis and superomedial thighs. Her breasts appear normal. Transabdominal ultrasound reveals an absent uterus. Serum testosterone levels is within the normal range for females. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?,E,"The most likely cause of this patient's condition is E. Failure of paramesonephric duct development. This is because the patient has an absent uterus, which is a common finding in conditions that affect the development of the paramesonephric (Müllerian) ducts. These ducts are responsible for the development of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and the upper part of the vagina in females. Failure of these ducts to develop properly can result in a condition known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, which is characterized by a congenitally absent uterus and variable degrees of vaginal atresia or hypoplasia.

Options A, B, C, and D are less likely because:

A. Pituitary tumor could cause amenorrhea, but it would typically be associated with other hormonal imbalances or symptoms that are not present in this patient.

B. Absence of the second X chromosome (Turner syndrome) would likely present with other features such as short stature, webbed neck, and cardiac defects, and would not typically present with normal secondary sexual characteristics.

C. Mutation in an enzyme that metabolizes testosterone would likely affect the levels of circulating androgens, which would be reflected in abnormal testosterone levels or signs of virilization, which are not present in this patient.

D. Androgen receptor mutation (as in androgen insensitivity syndrome) would result in the development of external female genitalia despite the presence of a 46,XY karyotype, but would not typically result in an absent uterus without other signs of androgen insensitivity, such as breast development in a phenotypic male.",Success

She has gastroesophageal reflux disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Menarche was at the age of 10 years and her last menstrual period was 2 years ago. Current medications include omeprazole and levothyroxine. Abdominal examination shows shifting dullness. There is tenderness to palpation of the right lower quadrant but no guarding or rebound. Bimanual palpation shows a small uterus and a right adnexal mass. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",B,"The most likely finding in this patient is an elevated serum CA-125 level (Option B). The patient's symptoms and examination findings are concerning for ovarian cancer. The increase in abdominal girth, weight loss, fatigue, and the presence of a right adnexal mass are all suggestive of this diagnosis. CA-125 is a tumor marker that is often elevated in patients with ovarian cancer.

He was coming to the United States to spend time with some extended family. According to the grand-daughter his mental status was altered upon arrival and his health began to decline. She is not aware of his past medical status or medications. At the hospital, his blood pressure is 98/60 mm Hg, the pulse id 110/min, the respiratory rate is 21/min, and the temperature is 35.6°C (96.1°F). On physical exam, the patient appears cachectic, drowsy, and only responds to questions by nodding his head. His heart rate is tachycardic with a regular rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The cystotomy incision for his suprapelvic catheter is red and swollen. The patient admitted to the hospital and stabilized and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The catheter tube produces no urine over 24 hours and only thick green-white puss can be expressed. The treatment team concludes this patient has urinary tract obstruction. What is the best method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction in this patient?",B,"The best method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction in this patient would be option C, an abdominal-pelvic CT scan. This imaging modality can provide detailed images of the urinary tract, including the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra, and help identify the location and cause of the obstruction. It can also assess the degree of hydronephrosis (swelling of the kidneys due to urine backup) and any associated complications such as abscesses or fistulas. Ultrasound (option B) could also be useful in evaluating the urinary tract, but it may not provide as detailed information as a CT scan, especially in the presence of gas or obesity. Renal biopsy (option A) is not indicated for evaluating urinary tract obstruction, as it is an invasive procedure used to diagnose kidney diseases. Blood analysis (option D) and urine analysis (option E) can provide information about kidney function and infection, but they do not directly evaluate the presence or cause of urinary tract obstruction.",Success
"A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider for intermittent shaking of his hands.

The shaking then gradually improves over the course of the day. His past medical history is otherwise notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His only home medication is pravastatin. The patient smokes half a pack per day of cigarettes and drinks 2-3 beers throughout the day. His family history is significant for Parkinson disease in his father. On physical exam, his blood pressure is 159/84, pulse is 74/min, and respirations are 12/min. He has a high frequency bilateral hand tremor elicited on finger-to-nose testing. His neurological exam is otherwise unremarkable. This patient should be started on which of the following medications?",C,"Based on the patient's history and physical exam, the most likely diagnosis for his hand tremor is essential tremor, which is exacerbated by alcohol withdrawal and smoking. Essential tremor often runs in families and can be confused with Parkinson's disease, but the absence of other Parkinsonian features such as bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability in this patient's exam suggests that essential tremor is more likely.

The patient's tremor improves over the course of the day, which is consistent with essential tremor, as opposed to a resting tremor characteristic of Parkinson's disease, which would not improve with activity. The patient's use of alcohol and smoking can also contribute to the tremor, as alcohol withdrawal and nicotine can exacerbate essential tremor.

The best medication to start for essential tremor is propranolol (Option C). Propranolol is a beta-blocker that is commonly used to treat essential tremor. It can help reduce the amplitude of the tremor and improve the patient's ability to perform daily activities. It is also relatively safe and well-tolerated in patients with hypertension, as the patient in this case has.

Alprazolam (Option A) is a benzodiazepine used for anxiety and panic disorders and is not typically used for tremor. Primidone (Option B) is an anticonvulsant that can also be used for essential tremor, but it is less commonly used as a first-line treatment compared to propranolol. Topiramate (Option D) is an anticonvulsant used for seizures and migraine prevention and is not typically used for tremor. Trihexyphenidyl (Option E) is an anticholinergic medication used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and is not indicated for essential tremor.",Success

"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after a motor vehicle accident. He is unconscious upon arrival and is found to have severe internal bleeding due to trauma. He is taken for emergency surgery and severely damaged tissues are removed. After surgery, the boy is taken into the PICU for recovery. Over the subsequent week, serial labs are drawn showing target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. He is started on a prophylactic regimen that is continued upon discharge. Which of the following is consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed in this case?",C,"The scenario described involves a child who has undergone significant trauma and surgery, leading to a postoperative condition characterized by target cells (which can indicate hemolysis), thrombocytosis (an increase in platelet count), and leukocytosis (an increase in white blood cell count). These findings suggest a complex inflammatory response and potential hemolytic processes. Given the context, the prophylactic regimen likely aims to prevent or manage complications arising from these conditions, such as infection or further hemolysis.

None of the options (A through E) directly address the specific conditions mentioned in the scenario (hemolysis, thrombocytosis, leukocytosis), but considering the context of postoperative care and the need to prevent secondary infections, the most likely prophylactic regimen would be an antibiotic. Among the options provided, antibiotics are represented by ribosome inhibitors (A and B), a cell wall synthesis inhibitor (C), a DNA gyrase inhibitor (D), and a folate metabolism inhibitor (E).

Given the severity of the case and the potential for secondary infections, an antibiotic that targets a broad spectrum of bacteria would be appropriate. Among the options, a 50S ribosome inhibitor (B) or a cell wall cross-linking inhibitor (C) could be considered. However, 50S ribosome inhibitors (such as macrolides) are less likely to be used prophylactically in this context compared to cell wall cross-linking inhibitors (such as beta-lactams, including penicillins and cephalosporins), which are commonly used for prophylaxis against a wide range of bacterial infections.

Thus, the mechanism of action of the drug most likely prescribed in this case is a **cell wall cross-linking inhibitor** (option C), which is consistent with the need to prevent secondary bacterial infections in a critically ill postoperative patient.",Success

The scotch tape test is positive. The patient has a previous documented allergy to albendazole. Which of the following is an alternative medication that can be used?",E,"The patient's symptoms and the positive Scotch tape test are indicative of a parasitic infection, likely pinworms (Enterobius vermicularis). Given the patient's allergy to albendazole, an alternative medication is needed. Among the options provided, ivermectin (option C) is an appropriate alternative treatment for pinworm infection.

Ivermectin is an antiparasitic medication that is effective against a variety of parasitic worms, including pinworms. It works by paralyzing and killing the parasites. While it is not the first-line treatment for pinworms (mebendazole or albendazole are often used), ivermectin can be used as an alternative in cases where the first-line treatments are contraindicated, such as in this patient with an allergy to albendazole.

The other options are not suitable for treating pinworms:
A. Amphotericin B is used for fungal infections, not pinworms.
B. Diethylcarbamazine is used for filariasis, not pinworms.
D. Praziquantel is used for tapeworms and flukes, not pinworms.
E. Pyrantel pamoate can be used for pinworms, but ivermectin is generally considered more effective and is a better alternative given the patient's allergy to albendazole.",Success
"A 21-year-old female presents to the office after a health screening in which she was found to have high blood pressure. At the office, the blood pressure is 168/114 mm Hg. You have seen the patient in the past for amenorrhea and infertility issues, but she denies taking any medication at this time. On examination, the patient is short and normal weight but has a webbed neck. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the elevated blood pressure?",A,"The most likely cause of the elevated blood pressure in this patient is C. Neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal gland. The presence of a webbed neck, along with the history of amenorrhea and infertility, suggests a possible diagnosis of Turner syndrome. However, the specific cause of hypertension in this case is more likely related to a neuroendocrine tumor, such as a pheochromocytoma, which can cause episodic or sustained hypertension. This is because pheochromocytomas secrete catecholamines, which can lead to hypertension.

Option A, central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys (horseshoe kidney), can lead to hypertension, but it is not as commonly associated with the symptoms described.

Option B, genetic predisposition to essential hypertension, could contribute to hypertension, but it does not explain the webbed neck or the severity of the blood pressure reading.

Option D, oral contraceptive use, can contribute to hypertension, but the patient denies taking any medication.

It is calculated as the inverse of the absolute risk reduction (ARR).

The absolute risk reduction is calculated as the difference in the event rate between the treatment group and the control group. In this case, the event is being cured.

First, we need to find the event rates for both groups:

Event rate for the study treatment group (drug A) = 190/250 = 0.76
Event rate for the control group = 165/250 = 0.66

The ACGME's Common Program Requirements specify that residents must not work more than 80 hours per week, averaged over a four-week period, and must have at least one day off in seven. Additionally, the ACGME requires that residents have a period of 10 consecutive hours free from duty to ensure adequate rest and recovery.

In this case, the resident is already working 60 hours per week as part of his residency program and an additional 10 hours on Saturdays. This totals 70 hours per week. If he wishes to work more hours, he must ensure that he does not exceed the 80-hour workweek limit and that he adheres to the rest and recovery requirements.

Given that he has Sundays free, he could potentially work up to an additional 10 hours on that day without exceeding the 80-hour workweek limit, as long as he does not work more than 24 consecutive hours and has at least 10 hours of rest between shifts. However, it is important for the resident to consider the impact of additional work hours on his well-being and patient safety. Working long hours can lead to fatigue, which may negatively affect his performance and decision-making abilities.

On physical exam, he is found to be anxious but does not have any visible injuries other than the lacerations. Which of the following processes would most likely be seen in this patient?",E,"The most likely process occurring in this patient is E. Increased norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node. The patient's presentation is consistent with a traumatic event leading to anxiety and the body's natural stress response. This response includes the release of norepinephrine, which acts on the sinoatrial node to increase heart rate and contractility, as well as vasoconstriction to help maintain blood pressure and redirect blood flow to vital organs. This is part of the body's fight or flight response to acute stress or injury.",Success
"A 14-year-old teenager presents to his pediatrician complaining of frequent headaches and excessive fatigue during soccer practice. His mother notes that he seems to have gained a lot of weight despite the fact that he eats a healthy, well-balanced diet. His teachers have also become concerned because he leaves class to use the restroom frequently throughout the day. He has no medical problems and family history is insignificant. A physical exam is significant for a short, overweight child with nonpitting edema and decreased reflexes. His systolic blood pressure drops by 20 mm Hg when he stands. Fundoscopic exam is significant for papilledema and visual field exam is significant for bitemporal hemianopsia. Laboratory findings include:

Free T4 6 pmol/L N: 10–20 pmol/L
What is the necessary treatment?",D,"Based on the symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is a pituitary adenoma with secondary hypothyroidism and possibly other hormone deficiencies. The symptoms of headaches, visual field changes, and the physical exam findings of papilledema suggest increased intracranial pressure, which can be caused by a pituitary tumor pressing on the optic chiasm. The laboratory findings of hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, and metabolic acidosis suggest adrenal insufficiency, which can also be caused by a pituitary tumor. The low TSH and free T4 levels suggest central hypothyroidism, which is also consistent with pituitary dysfunction.

The treatment for a pituitary adenoma depends on the size and location of the tumor, as well as the patient's symptoms. In this case, the patient's symptoms are severe and require immediate treatment. The most appropriate treatment would be surgical resection of the tumor, followed by hormone replacement therapy to address the deficiencies caused by the tumor. Hormone replacement therapy would include thyroid hormone replacement, as well as possibly glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids to address adrenal insufficiency. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Surgical resection and E. Hormone replacement therapy. However, since the options provided do not allow for both answers to be selected, the most appropriate single answer would be E. Hormone replacement therapy, as this is an immediate need for the patient's survival, but it should be noted that surgical resection is also a critical component of the treatment plan.",Success
"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?",E,"The correct answer is E. A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.

Explanation: A Western blot is used to detect and quantify proteins, including HIF-1α. In RCC, HIF-1α is not hydroxylated by VHL even under normoxic conditions, leading to its stabilization and accumulation. Therefore, a Western blot would show increased HIF-1α in RCC cells under normoxic conditions compared to normoxic control cells where HIF-1α would be degraded. Northern and Southern blots are not suitable for detecting protein levels; Northern blots are used for RNA and Southern blots for DNA.",Success

Bleeding time: 3 minutes
Prothrombin time: 11 seconds
Partial thromboplastin time: 53 seconds
Bradykinin formation: decreased

Which of the following factors is most likely defective in this patient?",E,"The patient's symptoms and coagulation test results suggest a deficiency in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. The prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and decreased bradykinin formation point to a deficiency in factors involved in the intrinsic pathway. Factor XII is part of the intrinsic pathway and is also involved in the activation of the kallikrein-kinin system, which leads to bradykinin formation. A deficiency in Factor XII would result in a prolonged PTT and decreased bradykinin formation, consistent with the patient's test results. Therefore, the most likely factor that is defective in this patient is Factor XII (Option E). However, it is important to note that Factor XII deficiency is usually asymptomatic, and the patient's symptoms are more likely due to the acute injury and the subsequent inflammatory response.

"A 56-year-old patient is being treated with oral amoxicillin for community-acquired pneumonia. The plasma clearance of the drug is calculated as 15.0 L/h. Oral bioavailability of the drug is 75%. Sensitivity analysis of a sputum culture shows a minimal inhibitory concentration of 1 μg/mL for the causative pathogen. The target plasma concentration is 2 mg/L. If the drug is administered twice per day, which of the following dosages should be administered at each dosing interval to maintain a steady state?",B,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the dose required to achieve the target plasma concentration (Cp) of 2 mg/L at steady state (Css). The dose (D) can be calculated using the following equation:

\[ D = \frac{Vd \times Css}{F} \]

Where:
- \(Vd\) is the volume of distribution,
- \(Css\) is the steady-state concentration,
- \(F\) is the oral bioavailability.

However, the volume of distribution (\(Vd\)) is not directly provided. We can infer it from the clearance (Cl) and the half-life (\(t_{1/2}\)) of the drug using the relationship:

\[ Cl = \frac{Vd \times ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} \]

But since \(t_{1/2}\) is not given, we need to approach the problem differently. We can use the clearance (Cl) and the target concentration (\(Css\)) to find the dose per day (D) and then divide by the number of doses per day to find the dose per dose interval. The daily dose (D) can be calculated using the equation:

\[ D = Cl \times Css \]

Given:
- \(Cl = 15.0 \, L/h\)
- \(Css = 2 \, mg/L\)
- \(F = 75\% = 0.75\)

First, calculate the daily dose (D) required:

\[ D = 15.0 \, L/h \times 2 \, mg/L = 30 \, mg/h \]

Since the drug is administered twice per day, the dose per dose interval is:

\[ D_{interval} = \frac{30 \, mg/h \times 24 \, h}{2} = 360 \, mg/day \]

But this is the dose before accounting for bioavailability. To find the actual dose to be administered, we need to adjust for bioavailability:

\[ D_{actual} = \frac{360 \, mg}{0.75} = 480 \, mg \]

Therefore, the dose that should be administered at each dosing interval to maintain a steady state is:

\[ \boxed{B. 480 \, mg} \]",Success
"A 5-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office by his parents after they noticed blood in his urine. The child has been complaining of difficulty in passing urine and has lower abdominal pain. He seems more bloated than usual. On some occasions, he starts crying while passing urine, primarily because of a burning sensation. A urinalysis is performed, and the results are as follows:
Urine pH 6.2
Urine specific gravity 1.010
Glucose Negative
Ketones Negative
RBCs 1-2/hpf
WBCs 0-1/hpf
Casts 2-3/hpf
The pediatrician believes the boy has a bladder infection with a double-stranded DNA virus. Which of the following conditions is also commonly associated with this viral infection?",A,"The given information about the urinalysis results does not provide evidence of a viral infection directly. However, the symptoms described, including blood in the urine, difficulty passing urine, lower abdominal pain, and a burning sensation, are more indicative of a urinary tract infection (UTI), which is often caused by bacteria, not a virus. The presence of casts in the urine can also suggest kidney involvement.

The pediatrician's suspicion of a viral infection causing the bladder infection is not typical, as viruses are less common causes of bladder infections. However, if we are to consider a viral etiology based on the pediatrician's suspicion, the most likely condition associated with a double-stranded DNA virus that could potentially affect the urinary tract is not listed among the options provided. Common double-stranded DNA viruses include herpesviruses and adenoviruses, but these typically do not cause bladder infections as a primary symptom.

Among the options given, none directly correlates with a viral infection causing the symptoms described. However, if we consider the common associations with double-stranded DNA viruses:

A. Gastroenteritis - This is often caused by viruses, but not typically by those that would cause bladder infections.
B. Painful dermatomal vesicles - This is characteristic of herpes zoster (shingles), caused by the varicella-zoster virus, a double-stranded DNA virus.
C. Lymphadenopathy - This can be a symptom of viral infections, including those caused by double-stranded DNA viruses like Epstein-Barr virus.
D. Vesicular rash - This can be seen in infections caused by herpesviruses, which are double-stranded DNA viruses.
E. Plantar warts - These are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a double-stranded DNA virus but typically does not cause bladder infections.

Given the options, the most likely answer that could be associated with a double-stranded DNA virus, although not directly related to the symptoms described for a bladder infection, would be:

D. Vesicular rash

This is because vesicular rashes can be caused by herpesviruses, which are double-stranded DNA viruses. However, it's important to note that this choice does not directly address the symptoms of the bladder infection described. A more accurate diagnosis would require further testing and evaluation to determine the specific cause of the symptoms.",Success

An x-ray of the chest shows thickened bronchial walls and perihilar opacities. Sputum culture shows scattered septate hyphae that branch at 45 degrees. Which of the following is most likely to be increased in this patient?",E,"The patient's history of asthma, frequent exacerbations, and the physical examination findings of scattered expiratory wheezing, along with the laboratory findings of increased eosinophils and elevated serum immunoglobulin E, suggest an allergic or eosinophilic component to her condition. The presence of septate hyphae that branch at 45 degrees on sputum culture is characteristic of Aspergillus species, which can cause allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in susceptible individuals with asthma.

In the context of ABPA, there is a type 2 helper T cell (Th2) response that leads to increased levels of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which promote eosinophilia, IgE production, and airway hyperresponsiveness. Therefore, the most likely cytokine to be increased in this patient is IL-4 (Option E).

Ultrasound examination of the fetus reveals 2.5 L of amniotic fluid (normal 1.5-2.0 L) with an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 34 (normal AFI 20-25). Which of the following fetal abnormalities or dysfunctions could have contributed to these abnormal ultrasound findings?",C,"The ultrasound findings of polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid) in a 22-week gestation with an AFI of 34, along with the physical exam findings of a larger than expected uterine size and skin changes, suggest that there may be a fetal abnormality affecting the amniotic fluid volume. Among the options given, duodenal atresia (Option C) is the most likely cause of these ultrasound findings.

Duodenal atresia is a congenital obstruction of the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine, which can lead to polyhydramnios. This obstruction prevents the fetus from swallowing amniotic fluid, which is a normal process that helps regulate the volume of amniotic fluid. When the fetus cannot swallow, the volume of amniotic fluid increases, leading to polyhydramnios.

The other options are not typically associated with polyhydramnios:

A. Renal agenesis (absence of one or both kidneys) would lead to oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid volume) due to decreased urine production by the fetus, which is a major contributor to amniotic fluid volume.

B. Pulmonary hypoplasia (underdevelopment of the lungs) does not directly affect amniotic fluid volume. It is a consequence of conditions that limit chest space, such as oligohydramnios or thoracic abnormalities.

D. Posterior urethral valve (PUV) is a condition that obstructs the flow of urine from the bladder, which can lead to hydronephrosis (dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces due to urine backup) and potentially oligohydramnios if severe enough to affect urine production.

E. Polycystic kidney disease can lead to various renal dysfunctions, but it is not typically associated with polyhydramnios. It may cause oligohydramnios if there is significant impairment of renal function.

Which of the following medications is the treatment for this patient's intoxication?",C,"The dark, almost black-colored stool suggests the child may have ingested iron, which is consistent with the mother's vitamin supplements for microcytic anemia. Iron toxicity can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and dark stools. The treatment for iron toxicity is Deferoxamine (Option C), which is an iron chelator that binds to free iron in the bloodstream, making it less toxic and facilitating its excretion.",Success
"A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, breast tenderness, increased urinary frequency, and intermittent nausea for 2 weeks. Her last menstrual period was 7 weeks ago. She has a history of a seizure disorder treated with carbamazepine. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is positive. The child is at greatest risk of developing which of the following complications?",B,"The child is at greatest risk of developing B. Meningocele, due to the mother's use of carbamazepine during pregnancy. Carbamazepine is a known teratogen, and its use during pregnancy can increase the risk of neural tube defects, including meningocele and spina bifida. The other options listed are not directly associated with carbamazepine use during pregnancy.",Success
"Three patients present to the pediatrician for routine well-child visits. The first child’s mother reports that he seems to be breastfeeding well and voids at least eight times per day. His stools are a yellow color, and he does not seem to be straining. In the office, he can lift his head and chest when in the prone position, and he can track an object with his eyes to the midline. His hands remain fisted 50% of the time.

The second child’s parents report that she is doing well at home and seems to enjoy playing with her older brother. In the office, she can roll from supine to prone and can transfer her rattle from hand to hand. She cannot yet say any words.

The third child’s father reports that he is starting to explore the world around him. He has begun taking independent steps at home. In the office, he seems to recognize the name of several objects, but he cannot follow the direction to “grab the ball.” All three children are assessed as developmentally normal.

Which of the following represents these patient's respective ages?",E,"The correct answer is E. Ages 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months.

The first child's ability to lift his head and chest when prone, track objects to the midline, and the description of his feeding and voiding habits suggest he is around 2 months old. At this age, infants typically have fisted hands much of the time, and they are beginning to develop head control and visual tracking skills.

The second child's ability to roll from supine to prone and transfer objects from one hand to the other indicates she is around 6 months old. At this age, infants often begin to show more advanced motor skills, such as rolling over and passing objects between hands, and they start to interact more with their environment and family members.

The third child's ability to take independent steps and recognize the names of several objects suggests he is around 12 months old. At this age, toddlers are typically beginning to walk independently and are developing language skills, although they may not yet follow complex directions.",Success
"A 75-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with 30 minutes of slurred speech and arm weakness. On the drive over to the hospital, her symptoms have resolved completely. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, morbid obesity, gout, and vascular claudication. Her temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 184/111 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with normal strength and sensation in the patient's upper and lower extremities. The patient's memory is intact and her speech seems normal and fluent. Her gait is stable with no ataxia. An initial head CT demonstrates diffuse atrophy which is consistent with previous head CT scans. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The patient's presentation is consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is a temporary episode of neurological dysfunction caused by a lack of blood flow to part of the brain. The symptoms have resolved, but the risk of stroke is increased in the following days and weeks. The best next step in management would be to perform an MRI to evaluate for any acute ischemic changes that may not be visible on a CT scan. An MRI is more sensitive than a CT scan for detecting acute ischemic changes in the brain, which can help guide further management and treatment. Therefore, the correct answer is E. MRI.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with weakness. He states that it started yesterday and has been progressively worsening. Initially, he noticed blurry vision and some trouble speaking and swallowing but thought he was just coming down with a cold. He then noticed weakness of his facial muscles and shortness of breath. The patient works as a farmer and harvests and cans his own foods. He has had diarrhea recently and a cough prior to these symptoms of weakness. His temperature is 97.9°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 144/94 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a man who seems unable to smile with dysarthric speech. He takes shallow and weak breaths on pulmonary exam. The patient demonstrates 3/5 strength with diminished reflexes in his upper extremities. The patient is subsequently intubated. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?",A,"The patient's symptoms, including progressive weakness, difficulty speaking and swallowing, facial muscle weakness, and shortness of breath, along with his recent history of diarrhea and cough, suggest a diagnosis of botulism. Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which can be found in improperly canned or preserved foods. The toxin affects the nervous system, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis.

The best treatment for botulism is antitoxin, which can neutralize the botulinum toxin. Antitoxin should be administered as soon as possible after the diagnosis is suspected because it can prevent further progression of the disease. The patient's respiratory compromise necessitates intubation, and supportive care in an intensive care unit setting will be required.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A. Antitoxin",Success
A 79-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of difficulty starting urination and a vague sensation of fullness in the pelvis. Pelvic speculum examination in the lithotomy position shows a pink structure at the vaginal introitus that protrudes from the anterior vaginal wall when the patient is asked to cough. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?,C,"The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a cystocele (Option C). A cystocele is a herniation of the urinary bladder into the vagina, which can cause difficulty starting urination and a sensation of fullness in the pelvis. The description of a pink structure protruding from the anterior vaginal wall when the patient coughs is consistent with this diagnosis. Uterine prolapse (Option A) could also present with similar symptoms, but the specific description of the structure protruding from the anterior vaginal wall points more toward a cystocele. The other options (B, D, E) are less likely based on the symptoms and physical examination findings described.",Success
"A 30-year-old woman presents to the physician because of ongoing diarrhea for the past 1 month. She reports that diarrhea has been intermittently present for the past month. The stool is often loose and associated with blood and lower abdominal pain. She denies any recent travel history, and she works at a nursing home as a caretaker. She is not currently on any medications. Clinical examination shows mild tenderness in the suprapubic region, and there is no organomegaly. Findings on colonoscopy include patchy erythema and ulceration in the cecum, ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon. Mucosal biopsy shows colonic crypts with lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrates. What is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is B. Crohn’s disease. The patient's symptoms of diarrhea, blood in the stool, and lower abdominal pain, along with the patchy erythema, ulceration, and the presence of lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrates in the colonic crypts on biopsy, are consistent with the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease. This condition can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but the cecum, ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon are common sites. Ulcerative colitis (Option A) typically involves continuous inflammation of the colon and rectum, and the biopsy would show inflammation limited to the mucosa, unlike the deeper inflammation seen in Crohn’s disease. Acute infective colitis (Option C) would likely have a more acute onset and may be associated with a recent infection or antibiotic use. Pseudomembranous colitis (Option D) is typically associated with antibiotic use and would show pseudomembranes on colonoscopy. Irritable bowel syndrome (Option E) does not typically present with blood in the stool or significant inflammation on biopsy.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department after being stabbed 12 times in various parts of his body. Paramedics report extensive blood loss at the scene where he was found.

There is no motor or sensory deficits on the upper and lower extremities. The patient scores 18 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Which of the following medications is indicated in the patient?",D,"The patient's symptoms and history are most consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, a type of dementia. The symptoms of memory loss, poor orientation, and getting lost in familiar places are characteristic of this condition. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 18 also suggests cognitive impairment, as a score below 26 is considered abnormal and indicative of cognitive decline.

Among the medication options provided, Donepezil (Option D) is the most appropriate choice for this patient. Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used to treat mild to moderate dementia related to Alzheimer's disease. It works by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine in the brain, which can help improve memory and cognitive function.

The other medications listed are not indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease:

A. Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant used to treat depression.
B. Sertraline is an SSRI antidepressant also used for depression and anxiety disorders.

"A 16-year-old teenager presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe pain in his right knee. He describes the pain as the worst pain he has ever felt. He denies any recent trauma or injury to the knee. The joint appears red and swollen and is hot to the touch. He denies any lower extremity numbness. There is no family history of joint or connective tissue disorders. The teenager is otherwise healthy. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 124/82 mm Hg, respirations are 17/min, pulse is 104/min, and temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F). On palpation of the affected joint, there is evidence of tenderness and capsular swelling; the joint is red and warm. Laboratory studies show increased serum CRP and procalcitonin levels. Which of the following will most likely found with analysis of his synovial fluid?",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is acute septic arthritis. The high fever, severe pain, redness, warmth, and swelling of the knee joint, along with the elevated inflammatory markers (CRP and procalcitonin), are all indicative of a bacterial infection within the joint. The analysis of synovial fluid in cases of septic arthritis typically shows a high white blood cell (WBC) count with a predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), low viscosity, and often a decreased glucose level compared to the serum.

Option B (WBC/mm3 53,000; % PMN > 75%; Viscosity low) is the most consistent with septic arthritis. The high WBC count and high percentage of PMNs indicate an acute inflammatory response to infection. The low viscosity of the synovial fluid is also characteristic of an infected joint, as the normal lubricating properties of the synovial fluid are disrupted by the inflammatory process.",Success

A peripheral blood smear reveals spherocytes. The Coombs test is negative. The physical examination is remarkable for scleral icterus and moderate splenomegaly. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic test of this patient’s underlying disorder?",A,"The presence of spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear, along with the negative Coombs test, suggests an intrinsic defect in the red blood cells rather than an immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. The most likely diagnosis is a form of hereditary spherocytosis or a paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The Coombs test being negative rules out immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. The moderate splenomegaly and scleral icterus are consistent with chronic hemolysis.

The most appropriate diagnostic test to differentiate between these conditions would be:

B. Flow cytometry for CD55/CD59

This test can identify the presence of PNH, which is characterized by a deficiency in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins CD55 and CD59 on the surface of red blood cells. The deficiency of these proteins leads to increased sensitivity of the red blood cells to complement-mediated lysis, which can result in hemolysis and the presence of spherocytes. Hereditary spherocytosis would not show a deficiency of CD55 and CD59, making this test useful for differential diagnosis.",Success
"A 39-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of personality changes over the past year. He has become increasingly irritable, loud, aggressive, and impulsive.

The patient's history of hemoptysis, nonproductive cough, fatigue, and significant weight loss are all concerning for malignancy. The location of the nodule at the apex of the left lung, along with its irregular borders, is also suggestive of a malignant process. Adenocarcinoma is a common type of lung cancer that can occur in non-smokers and is more likely to present as a solitary nodule.

An 11-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. He is growing along with the 75th percentile and meeting all milestones. Physical examination shows a poorly rugated scrotum. The palpation of the scrotum shows only 1 testicle. A 2nd testicle is palpated in the inguinal canal. The examination of the penis shows a normal urethral meatus. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,E,"The most appropriate next step in management for an 11-month-old boy with an undescended testicle (cryptorchidism) is E. Orchiopexy.

Orchiopexy is the surgical procedure used to correct cryptorchidism, which is the failure of one or both testicles to descend into the scrotum. It is typically recommended for infants around 12 months of age if the testicle has not descended spontaneously. Early surgical intervention is important to prevent potential complications such as infertility, testicular torsion, and an increased risk of testicular cancer. Orchiopexy involves moving the undescended testicle into the scrotum and securing it in place to ensure normal development and function.

Chorionic gonadotropin therapy (Option A) may be used in some cases to stimulate testosterone production and encourage testicular descent, but it is generally not as effective as surgery and is not the first-line treatment for cryptorchidism.

Exploratory laparoscopy (Option B) might be considered if the testicle is non-palpable and its location is uncertain. However, since the testicle is palpable in the inguinal canal in this case, exploratory laparoscopy is not the most appropriate next step.

Follow-up examination in 6 months (Option C) might be considered for a younger infant where spontaneous descent is still possible, but at 11 months, the likelihood of spontaneous descent is low, and surgical intervention is indicated.

Orchiectomy (Option D) is not appropriate in this case as it involves the removal of the testicle, which is not indicated for a child with a palpable undescended testicle that can potentially be salvaged with orchiopexy.",Success

Which of the following is associated with this patient's underlying pathology?",C,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest that he is experiencing jaundice, which is characterized by yellowing of the skin and eyes due to high levels of bilirubin in the blood. The total bilirubin level is 11.3 mg/dL, which is significantly elevated, and the direct bilirubin level is 7.8 mg/dL, indicating a significant amount of conjugated bilirubin. This suggests a problem with the excretion of bilirubin, possibly due to decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity (option B), which is an enzyme responsible for the conjugation of bilirubin in the liver, making it water-soluble for excretion in the bile.

Options A, C, D, and E do not directly correlate with the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings. Option A refers to a medication used for the treatment of hepatitis C, which is not indicated by the provided information. Option C, hyperpigmentation of the liver, is not a specific diagnosis or mechanism for jaundice.

The most common agents used for DVT prophylaxis in hospitalized patients are low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and unfractionated heparin (UFH). Both LMWHs and UFH work by inhibiting Factor Xa, which is a key enzyme in the coagulation cascade that converts prothrombin (Factor II) to thrombin (Factor IIa). Thrombin is essential for the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin and the formation of a stable clot.

The PT and PTT are two tests used to assess the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of the coagulation cascade, respectively. The PT is sensitive to deficiencies in Factors VII, V, II, and X, while the PTT is sensitive to deficiencies in Factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, and X. An elevated PTT in this case could be due to the effect of the DVT prophylaxis on Factor Xa.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

D. X

This indicates that the DVT prophylaxis is most directly affecting Factor X, which is a key factor in the coagulation pathway and is targeted by anticoagulants used for DVT prophylaxis.",Success
"A 47-year-old man with a history of HIV1 infection presents to his HIV clinic to discuss his antiretroviral medications. He is interested in including maraviroc in his maintenance regimen after seeing advertisements about the medication. On exam, his temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 116/74 mmHg, pulse is 64/min, and respirations are 12/min. His viral load is undetectable on his current regimen, and his blood count, electrolytes, and liver function tests have all been within normal limits. In order to consider maraviroc for therapy, a tropism assay needs to be performed. Which of the following receptors is affected by the use of maraviroc?",B,"Maraviroc is a medication that specifically targets the CCR5 co-receptor on the surface of CD4+ T cells, which is used by HIV to enter cells. However, this receptor is not listed among the options provided. Among the options given, none directly relate to the mechanism of action of maraviroc. However, the closest answer in terms of HIV biology would be:

B. gp120

Gp120 is a glycoprotein on the surface of the HIV virus that binds to the CD4 receptor and a co-receptor (either CCR5 or CXCR4) on the surface of target cells. Maraviroc blocks the CCR5 co-receptor, preventing the gp120 of the HIV virus from binding to it and thus blocking viral entry into the cell. However, it's important to note that maraviroc does not directly affect gp120, but rather the CCR5 co-receptor that gp120 binds to.",Success
"A 16-year-old female presents to her physician’s office after noticing a round lump in her left breast 2 months ago. She reports that the lump seemed to enlarge and became tender just preceding her last 2 menses. It is otherwise painless, and the patient denies any discharge or skin changes. She has no past medical history but her grandmother, age 72, was just diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The patient is an avid softball player at her high school and denies alcohol, smoking, or illicit drug use. On exam, the breasts appear symmetric and normal. A 3-cm round, mobile mass is palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There is slight tenderness to deep palpation of the mass. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy on either side. Which of the following is the most likely outcome of this patient’s condition?",D,"The most likely outcome of this patient’s condition is that the mass will most likely decrease in size or disappear over time (Option D). The description of the lump being round, mobile, and associated with tenderness preceding menses is consistent with a benign breast condition, such as a fibroadenoma or a cyst. These types of masses often fluctuate in size with the menstrual cycle and are not typically associated with increased cancer risk. However, given the patient's family history of breast cancer, it would be prudent to monitor the mass and possibly perform imaging studies to confirm the benign nature of the lesion. If the mass is confirmed to be benign, it may not require excision and could potentially resolve on its own. Starting oral contraceptives could potentially help regulate hormonal fluctuations and may influence the size of the mass, but it is not a guaranteed solution. Radiation and chemotherapy are not indicated for benign breast masses unless there is a significant and rapid change in the mass that raises suspicion for malignancy.",Success
"A 22-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a headache. She has had episodic headaches like this in the past and states that her headache today is severe, worse when laying down, and not responding to ibuprofen. She also reports a transient episode of vision loss and current blurry vision. She states she has a ringing in her ears as well. The patient has a past medical history of headaches, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and constipation. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 149/92 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is not remarkable and an initial head CT is within normal limits. Which of the following is the best next step in management for the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The patient's symptoms of severe headache, transient vision loss, blurry vision, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears) along with her past medical history of headaches and obesity suggest a possible diagnosis of intracranial hypertension. Her elevated blood pressure and the fact that her headache is worse when laying down also support this diagnosis. Since the initial head CT is within normal limits, the next best step would be to order an MRI to further investigate the cause of her symptoms.

Option D: MRI is the best next step in management for the most likely diagnosis of intracranial hypertension. An MRI can provide more detailed images of the brain and can help identify any abnormalities that may be causing the increased intracranial pressure. It can also help rule out other potential causes of her symptoms, such as a brain tumor or multiple sclerosis.

Options A, B, C, and E are not appropriate next steps for this patient. 100% oxygen (Option A) is not indicated for this patient's symptoms, and ibuprofen (Option B) has already been tried and was not effective. A lumbar puncture (Option C) can be used to measure the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid and can help diagnose intracranial hypertension, but it is not the first-line test for this condition. Tissue plasminogen activator (Option E) is used to treat acute ischemic stroke and is not indicated for this patient's symptoms.",Success
A 28-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of amenorrhea. Her last period occurred 4 months ago but she has not had sex in the last year and home pregnancy tests have come back negative. She first started having periods at age 13 and her periods have been unremarkable up until they stopped 4 months ago. Her past medical history is significant for radius and ulnar forearm fractures that she sustained in a car crash 3 months ago. She didn't see the car coming and has had increasing difficulty noticing objects in her peripheral vision. She also notes having recurrent headaches 5 months ago. Otherwise she has been healthy with no previous pregnancies. Physical exam reveals galactorrhea and temporal field visual defects. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for this patient's amenorrhea?,B,"The most likely mechanism responsible for this patient's amenorrhea is B. Inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release. The presence of galactorrhea and temporal field visual defects, along with the history of recurrent headaches, suggests a pituitary tumor, specifically a prolactinoma. Prolactinomas can cause increased prolactin levels, which in turn can inhibit the release of GnRH, leading to amenorrhea. The patient's history of recent fractures and difficulty with peripheral vision also support the possibility of a pituitary tumor affecting her visual fields and bone density.",Success
"A 57-year-old homeless man is brought to the emergency department because of several episodes of hematemesis in the past 24 hours. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse of 95/min, and blood pressure of 85/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, he appears confused and unable to give a complete history.

The patient's presentation with hematemesis, jaundice, palpable firm liver, splenomegaly, and ascites, along with the laboratory findings of elevated AST and ALT, low serum albumin, high total bilirubin, and prolonged prothrombin time, are all consistent with liver cirrhosis. The patient's homeless status and inability to give a complete history suggest a possible history of alcohol abuse, which is a common cause of liver cirrhosis.",Success
"A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department for a cough and fatigue. The patient was brought in from a nursing home with documentation stating that he has seemed confused for the past day according to the staff. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension. He is currently taking insulin, metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals crackles on pulmonary exam and S4 on cardiac auscultation. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",E,"The patient's presentation with cough, fatigue, confusion, and a high fever, along with his age and comorbidities (diabetes and hypertension), suggests a possible severe infection, likely pneumonia. The physical exam findings of crackles on pulmonary exam and an S4 heart sound (indicative of left ventricular dysfunction) further support this diagnosis and suggest possible heart failure secondary to the infection.

Given the patient's hypotension (107/58 mmHg) and tachycardia (120/min), he may be experiencing sepsis or septic shock, which requires immediate and aggressive treatment. The combination of his clinical status and the severity of his symptoms warrants admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and supportive care.

The choice of antibiotics should cover both atypical and typical bacterial pathogens, given the patient's age and the fact that he is from a nursing home, which is a high-risk environment for multidrug-resistant organisms. Ceftriaxone is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers many typical bacterial pathogens, while azithromycin covers atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma and Legionella.

On examination, the reflexes are hypertonic and the Babinski reflex is positive. The CT scan is shown. What is the most likely pathologic change?",B,"The most likely pathologic change in this scenario is B. Liquefactive necrosis. This type of necrosis is commonly seen in brain tissue following an ischemic event, such as a stroke, which can cause the tissue to become soft and eventually liquefy due to enzymatic digestion of the tissue. The presence of right hand and leg weakness, disorientation, and a history of ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension all point towards a cerebrovascular accident (stroke) as the cause of the patient's symptoms. The positive Babinski reflex and hypertonic reflexes are also indicative of upper motor neuron involvement, which is consistent with a stroke affecting the brain.",Success

However, this option is not listed among the choices provided. Among the options given, none directly address the likely diagnosis of erythema nodosum, which is suggested by the patient's history and physical examination findings. However, since erythema nodosum can be associated with infections, particularly streptococcal infections, and given the patient's recent history of a severe sore throat and fever, option A, a throat culture, could be considered as the next best diagnostic step to rule out a streptococcal infection as a potential trigger for the erythema nodosum.

A bone marrow aspiration is ordered but after multiple attempts, they are unable to obtain an adequate bone marrow sample. A peripheral blood smear would likely reveal cells that stain with which of the following stains?",D,"The question suggests that the patient has a condition that is affecting his blood cells, given the noted abnormalities in his complete blood count (CBC). The inability to obtain an adequate bone marrow sample can be indicative of certain conditions, such as myelofibrosis or other infiltrative bone marrow disorders. The peripheral blood smear is often examined in these cases to provide additional clues about the underlying pathology.

The options provided are different stains that can be used to identify specific features or types of cells in a blood smear. The correct answer will depend on the type of cells or abnormalities that are expected to be seen in this patient's blood smear.

A. Prussian Blue - This stain is used to detect iron in cells, which can be helpful in diagnosing iron overload disorders or sideroblastic anemia.

B. Ziehl-Neelsen - This is an acid-fast stain used to identify mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, in samples.

C. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) - This stain is used to detect polysaccharides and glycoproteins, and it can help identify certain types of leukemias, lymphomas, and other conditions like Gaucher's disease.

D. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) - This stain is used to identify osteoclasts and can be helpful in diagnosing conditions like Paget's disease of bone or multiple myeloma.

E. Giemsa - This is a general stain used for routine examination of blood smears to identify different types of blood cells and some abnormalities.

Given the patient's symptoms and the laboratory findings, the most likely reason for the bone marrow aspiration failure is a condition that affects the bone marrow itself, such as myelofibrosis. In myelofibrosis, the bone marrow becomes scarred, making it difficult to aspirate a sample. In this condition, the peripheral blood smear might show features such as teardrop-shaped red blood cells (dacrocytes), which are characteristic of myelofibrosis, and possibly leukoerythroblastic changes (immature blood cells in the peripheral blood).

The Giemsa stain (Option E) is the most appropriate choice for routine examination of a peripheral blood smear to identify these features and other abnormalities. While the other stains might be useful in specific circumstances, they are not the first-line stain for evaluating a peripheral blood smear in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is E.

Shifting dullness is present. There is a flapping tremor of both hands when outstretched and dorsiflexed. Neurologic examination shows no other focal findings. She completes the number connection test slower than the age-normalized standard. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The most appropriate next step in management for this patient is D. Administer lactulose. The patient's symptoms of increasing confusion, generalized fatigue, irritability, and inability to recall personal information are indicative of hepatic encephalopathy, a common complication in patients with liver cirrhosis, especially after TIPS placement. The flapping tremor and slowed number connection test further support this diagnosis. Lactulose is a non-absorbable disaccharide that is used to treat hepatic encephalopathy by reducing the production and absorption of ammonia in the gut, which can contribute to the confusion and other neurological symptoms.

Option A, reversal of TIPS, is not the most appropriate next step as it is a major procedure with significant risks and is not indicated solely for the management of hepatic encephalopathy, especially without evidence that the TIPS is malfunctioning or causing other complications.

Option B, paracentesis, is a procedure used to remove fluid from the peritoneal cavity, which can help relieve abdominal distension and discomfort in patients with ascites. While this patient has shifting dullness, indicating ascites, the primary concern is her neurological status, which is more urgently addressed by managing hepatic encephalopathy.

Option C, administering IV ceftriaxone, is not indicated unless there is a concurrent infection, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which is not suggested by the given history and examination findings.

Option E, administering vitamin B1 (thiamine), is important for the prevention and treatment of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which can occur in patients with alcohol use disorder.

Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 900,000/mm3 and elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid. Treatment with a medication is begun that is also used in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the beneficial effect of this drug in sickle cell disease?",B,"The medication that is used in the treatment of both the described condition (thrombocytosis with symptoms of lightheadedness, headaches, and easy bruising) and sickle cell disease is hydroxyurea. The mechanism of action that is most relevant to its beneficial effect in sickle cell disease is option B: Increase in circulating fetal hemoglobin.

Hydroxyurea increases the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which in turn helps to alleviate the symptoms of sickle cell disease. Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin and does not sickle. By increasing the levels of HbF, hydroxyurea helps to prevent the sickling of red blood cells, thereby reducing pain crises, improving oxygen delivery to tissues, and potentially reducing the need for blood transfusions in patients with sickle cell disease.

The other options do not accurately describe the mechanism of action of hydroxyurea in sickle cell disease:
A. Inhibition of thrombocyte aggregation is not a primary mechanism of action of hydroxyurea in sickle cell disease.
C. Substitution of cofactors for DNA synthesis is not relevant to hydroxyurea's effects in sickle cell disease.
D. Inhibition of stem cell differentiation is not a mechanism by which hydroxyurea treats sickle cell disease.

"Candida is injected into the skin of a 38-year-old female patient. Forty-eight hours later, there is a 14 mm raised, slightly hardened area at the injection site. What type of hypersensitivity reaction has occurred and what cell type plays a role?",D,"The correct answer is D. Type IV hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells.

Type IV hypersensitivity reactions, also known as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), are mediated by CD4+ T cells (helper T cells) and macrophages. In this scenario, the injection of Candida into the skin leads to a reaction 48 hours later, which is characteristic of a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction. The raised, slightly hardened area at the injection site is due to the infiltration of activated T cells and macrophages, which release cytokines and chemokines, causing inflammation and the formation of granulomas. Eosinophils and mast cells are not the primary cells involved in this type of reaction; they are more commonly associated with Type I hypersensitivity reactions (immediate hypersensitivity).",Success

"A 14-year-old girl comes to the physician because she has not yet had her period. She is at the 10th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. Examination shows a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, a low posterior hairline, forearms angled 20° away from the body when fully extended, and shortened fourth metacarpals bilaterally. Sexual development is Tanner stage 1. Which of the following statements about this patient's fertility is most accurate?",A,"The patient's symptoms are indicative of Turner syndrome, a genetic condition that affects females and is characterized by the partial or complete absence of one of the X chromosomes. The features described, such as a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, a low posterior hairline, forearms angled away from the body, and shortened fourth metacarpals, along with delayed puberty, are all consistent with this diagnosis. Turner syndrome often leads to gonadal dysgenesis, which results in primary amenorrhea and infertility.

Option A: Pregnancy success rate with donor oocytes is similar to patients with primary ovarian failure
This statement is true. Women with Turner syndrome typically have primary ovarian failure due to gonadal dysgenesis, which means their ovaries do not function properly. They may have very few or no follicles, leading to a lack of eggs. Using donor oocytes (eggs) can allow women with Turner syndrome to become pregnant, as the success rate with donor eggs is similar to that in other women with primary ovarian failure. However, it is important to note that the uterus of a woman with Turner syndrome may still be capable of carrying a pregnancy, so surrogacy is not necessarily required.

Option B: Administration of gonadotropins will increase the chances of conceiving
This statement is not accurate. Gonadotropins, such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), are hormones that stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs. However, in women with Turner syndrome, the ovaries often do not respond to these hormones due to the lack of functional follicles. Therefore, administration of gonadotropins is unlikely to increase the chances of conceiving in this population.

Option C: Impaired tubal ciliary function will prevent natural fertilization
This statement is not accurate. While some women with Turner syndrome may have structural abnormalities of the fallopian tubes, impaired tubal ciliary function is not a typical feature of the condition. The primary cause of infertility in Turner syndrome is the lack of functional ovarian tissue, not tubal dysfunction.

Option D: The majority of patients become pregnant without medical assistance
This statement is not accurate. The majority of women with Turner syndrome do not become pregnant without medical assistance due to primary ovarian failure and the lack of functional ovarian tissue. Assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) with donor eggs, are often necessary for these women to achieve pregnancy.

Option E: Functional gametes and the absence of a uterus make surrogacy necessary
This statement is not accurate. Women with Turner syndrome often have primary ovarian failure, which means they do not produce functional gametes (eggs). Additionally, while some women with Turner syndrome may have a small or absent uterus, this is not a universal feature of the condition. Surrogacy may be necessary for women with Turner syndrome who have a non-functional uterus, but it is not required solely due to the absence of functional gametes.

In summary, the most accurate statement about the patient's fertility is Option A: Pregnancy success rate with donor oocytes is similar to patients with primary ovarian failure.",Success
"An investigator is studying traumatic knee joint injuries in college athletes. Images and tissue samples are collected from 4 athletes with cartilaginous injury and 4 athletes with bone fractures. After 8 weeks, the athletes with bone fractures show almost complete resolution, while the athletes with cartilaginous injuries show only minimal signs of healing. The investigator hypothesizes that this is due to the absence of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration. Transplant of which of the following tissues would most likely promote healing in the group with cartilaginous injury?",A,"The correct answer is A. Perichondrium.

The perichondrium is a dense connective tissue that covers the surface of cartilage and contains progenitor cells that can differentiate into chondrocytes, the cells responsible for cartilage matrix production. Transplanting perichondrium would provide the necessary progenitor cells to regenerate the cartilage matrix in athletes with cartilaginous injuries, promoting healing.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because proteoglycans and chondronectin are components of the cartilage matrix, not cells capable of regeneration. Osteoblasts are cells responsible for bone matrix production and would not be effective in promoting cartilage healing.

Option E is incorrect because mature chondrocytes do not have the same regenerative capacity as progenitor cells and may not be as effective in promoting cartilage matrix regeneration.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of increasing weakness and numbness of the upper extremities for 5 days. During the past 2 days, she has had urinary incontinence not related to sneezing or laughing. Last summer, she had weakness and numbness of her right lower extremity that was worse when she was outside; she regained her strength 3 weeks later. She has no history of serious illness. She has had 10 male sexual partners in her lifetime and uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows an impaired tandem gait. There is mild spasticity and muscle strength is decreased in both upper extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ bilaterally. The abdominal reflex is absent. Muscle strength in the right lower extremity is mildly decreased. Sensation to vibration and fine touch is decreased over the upper extremities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",D,"The most appropriate next step in diagnosis for this patient would be:

D. MRI of the brain and spine

The patient's symptoms of increasing weakness and numbness in the upper extremities, urinary incontinence, and a history of a similar episode last summer affecting the right lower extremity suggest a neurological disorder. The MRI of the brain and spine would be the most effective tool to evaluate for potential causes such as multiple sclerosis (MS), which can present with these symptoms. MS is characterized by demyelination in the central nervous system, which can affect various functions including motor control, sensation, and bladder function.

The other options are less likely to provide useful information for diagnosing the cause of her symptoms:

A. Antinuclear antibody testing would be more appropriate for evaluating autoimmune disorders such as lupus, but it is not specific for neurological disorders.

B. Muscle biopsy is not the first-line test for neurological disorders affecting the central nervous system.

C. Rapid plasma reagin test is used to screen for syphilis, which can cause neurological symptoms, but it is not the most appropriate initial test for this patient's presentation.

E. Lumbar puncture can be helpful in diagnosing conditions like multiple sclerosis by analyzing cerebrospinal fluid, but it is typically performed after an MRI has suggested a potential central nervous system disorder.",Success
"A 37-year-old woman presents to your office with heartburn. Following an extensive workup, you diagnose her with a duodenal ulcer secondary to H. pylori infection. You prescribe triple therapy of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of omeprazole?",D,"The mechanism of action of omeprazole is D. Inhibition of primary active transport. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that irreversibly inhibits the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This enzyme is responsible for the final step in acid production, and its inhibition leads to a reduction in gastric acid secretion. This mechanism is specific to the proton pump and does not involve SST2 receptors, parasympathetic inhibition, H2 receptor blockade, or inhibition of the 50S ribosomal subunit.",Success
"A 47-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of worsening pain, discoloration, and swelling of her right hand. Two days ago, she was camping outdoors in Texas with her two young children. She was awoken in the middle of the night by “something crawling on my hand.” The following morning, she saw a wound on her hand that was initially painless, but over the next several hours she noticed reddening and blistering. Yesterday, the lesion turned blue with a blackish discoloration at the center. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 83/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a bluish plaque with a central area of necrosis surrounded by a rim of erythema at the dorsum of the right hand. Which of the following animals is most likely responsible for the patient's symptoms?",C,"The patient's symptoms are most consistent with a bite from a brown recluse spider (Option C). The description of the wound, which includes initial painlessness, followed by reddening, blistering, and then discoloration and necrosis, is characteristic of a brown recluse spider bite. These spiders are commonly found in the southern and midwestern United States, including Texas, and often bite when they are accidentally pressed against the skin by clothing or bedding.",Success
"Two weeks after starting chemotherapy with etoposide, a 66-year-old man with small cell lung cancer comes to the physician because of persistent nausea and vomiting. His symptoms improve significantly after the administration of metoclopramide. This patient's symptoms were most likely due to the effect of chemotherapy on which of the following structures?",E,"The patient's symptoms of persistent nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy are most likely due to the effect of chemotherapy on the area postrema (option E). The area postrema is a small region in the brainstem that is involved in the regulation of emesis (vomiting) and is particularly sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents. It is often referred to as the ""chemoreceptor trigger zone"" and is responsible for initiating the vomiting reflex in response to chemotherapeutic drugs and other emetogenic stimuli. The administration of metoclopramide, a medication that blocks dopamine receptors and can inhibit the vomiting reflex, would be effective in managing symptoms related to the area postrema.",Success
"A 55-year-old construction worker is struck by a high-voltage power line while on duty. According to bystanders, the cable struck him on his right arm, after which the man slumped to the ground with his arms and legs shaking. In the emergency department, the man is alert but in severe pain localizing bilaterally in the flanks as well as in his right arm where contact with the power line occurred. A 6 cm burn is present on the right arm. His vitals are within normal limits except for mild tachypnea at 21/min. Which of the following diagnostic tests should be conducted first to evaluate this patient?",C,"The first diagnostic test that should be conducted in this scenario is a FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) ultrasound assessment. This is because the patient has been involved in a high-energy traumatic event (contact with a high-voltage power line), and the FAST ultrasound is a quick and effective way to assess for any internal bleeding in the abdomen or pericardial space, which can be life-threatening. The patient's symptoms of severe pain localizing bilaterally in the flanks could indicate internal injuries.

Option B (urine dipstick) and C (urinalysis) are important to check for myoglobinuria or hematuria, which can occur due to muscle damage or kidney injury from the electric shock, but these tests are not as immediately critical as ruling out internal bleeding.

Option D (X-ray of the arm and shoulder) is also important to evaluate the extent of injury to the right arm where the contact occurred, but it is not the first priority when there is a possibility of life-threatening internal injuries.

Option E (EEG) is not indicated in this case as it is used to evaluate brain function, particularly in cases of seizures or neurological disorders, and there is no indication of such issues based on the patient's presentation.",Success
"A 69-year-old male presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath. The patient has presented three times this past month with similar complaints. The patient sees no primary care physician and is currently not taking any medications. The patient states his shortness of breath started when he was walking from his car to a local restaurant. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse is 100/min, blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. On physical exam you note a fatigued appearing gentleman. Cardiovascular exam reveals an additional heart sound after S2. Pulmonary exam is notable for bilateral crackles. Abdominal exam reveals an obese abdomen without pain in any of the quadrants. Lower extremity pitting edema is noted bilaterally. Which of the following sets of lab values most likely corresponds to this patient's presentation?",C,"The patient's presentation is most consistent with heart failure, given his symptoms of shortness of breath, bilateral crackles on lung auscultation, and pitting edema in the lower extremities. The additional heart sound after S2, which is likely an S3 gallop, is also indicative of heart failure. Among the options provided, the lab values that most likely correspond to this patient's presentation are:

C. High BNP, high ADH, low sodium, low potassium

Explanation:
1. High BNP: B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a hormone produced by the ventricles of the heart in response to stretching of heart muscle cells, which occurs in heart failure. Elevated BNP levels are indicative of heart failure.
2. High ADH: Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is secreted in response to low blood volume or low blood pressure, which can occur in heart failure. High ADH levels can lead to water retention and contribute to the development of edema.
3. Low sodium: Heart failure can lead to the development of hyponatremia (low sodium levels) due to the effects of high ADH levels and the body's attempt to retain water.
4. Low potassium: Heart failure patients may have low potassium levels due to diuretic therapy, which is commonly used to manage fluid overload in heart failure. However, in the absence of diuretic therapy, as is the case for this patient, low potassium levels may be less expected. Nevertheless, it is not uncommon for heart failure patients to have electrolyte imbalances, including low potassium, due to the effects of the disease itself and other factors.

Therefore, option C is the most likely set of lab values for this patient.",Success
"A 48-year-old man presents to the clinic with nausea, vomiting, fever, and pain in the right upper quadrant of his abdomen for the past 18 hours.

On physical examination, his temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. On examination of the abdomen, tenderness is present over the right upper quadrant; palpation over the area produces an inspiratory pause. An urgent bedside ultrasonogram shows a dilated common bile duct stone, but no stone in the common bile duct or in the gallbladder. Laboratory results show the following:
Hemoglobin 15.4 g/dL (9.56 mmol/L)

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The patient's symptoms, including fever, pain in the right upper quadrant, and laboratory results showing elevated white blood cell count, bilirubin, and liver enzymes, along with the ultrasound finding of a dilated common bile duct, suggest acute cholecystitis with possible common bile duct obstruction. The presence of a stone in the common bile duct is a significant finding that requires immediate attention to prevent complications such as cholangitis or pancreatitis.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most appropriate next step in management is:

D. Urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)

ERCP would allow for the visualization of the biliary tree, confirmation of the stone's location, and potentially the removal of the stone through sphincterotomy. Once the obstruction is addressed, the patient can be stabilized, and then a laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be planned electively to remove the gallbladder and prevent future episodes of cholecystitis.",Success

The patient's symptoms of high fever, rigidity, altered mental status, and autonomic instability (as indicated by his blood pressure and pulse) are consistent with NMS. The recent administration of haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication known to cause NMS, is a significant risk factor.

What should be included in his medication regimen?",D,"The patient's CD4+ count of 170 cells/mm^3 indicates that he has advanced HIV infection. At this stage, prophylaxis against opportunistic infections is indicated. Among the options provided, Fluconazole (Option C) is the most appropriate choice for prophylaxis against fungal infections, particularly candidiasis, which is common in HIV-infected patients with low CD4+ counts.

However, it is important to note that the initial antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen should be tailored based on the patient's HIV viral load, CD4+ count, resistance testing, and comorbidities. The specific ART regimen is not listed among the options, but it is crucial for the management of HIV. The patient should be started on a combination of antiretroviral drugs to suppress the viral load and improve the CD4+ count.

Additionally, prophylaxis against other opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) should also be considered based on the CD4+ count. However, these medications (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for PCP and azithromycin or clarithromycin for MAC) are not listed among the options.

A fine-needle aspiration is performed and the physician calls telling the patient that she has a neoplasm of the thyroid. Which of the following diagnoses is the most likely?,A,"The decreased iodine uptake in the thyroid nodule suggests that it is a ""cold"" nodule, which can be indicative of a malignant process. Among the options provided, papillary carcinoma (Option A) and follicular carcinoma (Option C) are the most common types of thyroid cancer. However, papillary carcinomas often show increased or normal uptake, while follicular carcinomas can have decreased uptake, making them appear as cold nodules in a radionuclide scan. Anaplastic (Option D) and medullary carcinomas (Option B) are less common and typically do not show characteristic patterns of iodine uptake. Hurthle cell carcinoma (Option E), a variant of follicular carcinoma, can also present as a cold nodule.

"A 58-year-old male presents with an acutely elevated blood pressure of 220/140 mmHg. The patient complains of a headache and chest pain, and he has been vomiting for the last several hours. Physical exam demonstrates papilledema and a depressed level of consciousness. To treat this patient's hypertensive emergency, he is started on an IV medication commonly used in this situation. The agent exerts its effect by releasing nitric oxide as a metabolite, which subsequently activates guanylate cyclase and increases production of cGMP in vascular smooth muscle. Which of the following clinical effects would be expected from administration of this medication?",D,"The medication described in the question is a vasodilator that works by increasing cGMP in vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation. The clinical effect expected from this medication would be a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (option E is incorrect). This vasodilation would also lead to a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (option D is correct), as the afterload on the heart is reduced, allowing for better ventricular filling and reduced pressure in the pulmonary circulation.

Options A, B, and C are not the primary effects of this medication. Decreased cardiac contractility (option A) and decreased stroke volume (option C) are not typical effects of vasodilators. Increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (option B) might occur if the medication predominantly dilated the veins, increasing venous return to the heart, but this is not the expected effect of a medication that primarily dilates arteries by the mechanism described.

This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?",C,"The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a diagnosis of hemolytic anemia, likely due to hereditary spherocytosis given the presence of spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear (not shown but implied by the question's context). Among the given options, splenic sequestration crisis (Option E) is the most relevant complication for a patient with hereditary spherocytosis.

A splenic sequestration crisis occurs when there is sudden pooling of a large number of red blood cells in the spleen, leading to an acute drop in circulating red blood cells and potential shock. This is a known complication in patients with hereditary spherocytosis, especially in young children.

Here is the rationale for why the other options are less likely:

A. Malaria: Although jaundice can occur in malaria, the history of an upper respiratory tract infection and the specific finding of spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear are more indicative of hereditary spherocytosis.

B. Acute myelogenous leukemia: This would not typically present with spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear, and the history of an upper respiratory tract infection is not a typical feature.

C. Cholecystitis: This is an inflammation of the gallbladder and is not a typical complication of hereditary spherocytosis. While jaundice can occur in cholecystitis, the presence of spherocytes and the history of an upper respiratory tract infection do not fit this diagnosis.

D. Renal papillary necrosis: This is a condition that affects the kidneys and is not a typical complication of hereditary spherocytosis. It is more commonly associated with diabetes, hypertension, and the use of certain medications.

Fingerstick blood glucose is 124 mg/dL. Laboratory tests are pending. A urinary catheter is placed, and intravenous fluids are started. Abdominal imaging shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",A,"Given the patient's symptoms of generalized abdominal pain, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, along with her physical examination findings of a constricted pupil, pale and cold extremities, and a palpable bladder, the initial management should focus on addressing potential causes of her symptoms and stabilizing her condition. The fact that she has been taking an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication that she cannot recall the name of is a significant piece of information that can guide the next steps in her management.

The presence of constricted pupils, in particular, can be a sign of opioid overdose, which can cause respiratory depression, hypotension, and gastrointestinal symptoms like those the patient is experiencing. Therefore, the administration of naloxone (Option A) would be the next best step in her management to reverse the effects of any potential opioid overdose. Naloxone is a safe and effective medication for reversing opioid effects and can rapidly improve respiratory function and blood pressure if the patient's symptoms are due to an opioid overdose.

Options B (administer opioid analgesics), C (scopolamine patch), D (start dextrose infusion), and E (perform a gastric lavage) are not the next best steps given the current information. Administering more opioids (Option B) would be contraindicated if the patient's symptoms are due to an overdose. Scopolamine (Option C) is used for motion sickness and postoperative nausea and vomiting, and there is no indication for its use in this scenario. Starting a dextrose infusion (Option D) is not indicated as the patient's blood glucose is within normal range. Performing a gastric lavage (Option E) is not typically indicated for abdominal pain and vomiting unless there is a known ingestion of a toxic substance, which is not the case here.

"An 11-month-old male infant is brought to his pediatrician by his mother. She is concerned about his leg and his inability to stand. He was born vaginally to a 33-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) from an uncomplicated pregnancy at 39 weeks. He has met all developmental milestones and is up to date on all vaccinations. His mother explains that he can normally stand without help and can walk briefly on his own. However, he hit his right leg against a chair 2 days ago. The area became edematous and bruised overtime and the infant became unable to stand or crawl and cries when he puts weight on it. The mother denies any child abuse from her family or child care. The patient’s vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 137/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 36.7°C (97.0°F). His length and weight are both between the 15th and 25th percentile. On physical examination, blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae are noted. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits for his age. There is joint hypermobility and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities. The patient’s right calf appears slightly deformed, edematous, and warm to the tough. The patient begins to cry loudly when the physician palpates his leg. The patient’s X-ray shows an incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis. What is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?",B,"The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is D. Defective collagen type 3. The presence of joint hypermobility, decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities, and blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae, along with the history of a minor injury leading to a significant fracture, suggests a connective tissue disorder such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) or a similar condition. However, the specific mention of defective collagen type 3 points towards a diagnosis of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS), which is caused by mutations in the COL3A1 gene, leading to defects in the synthesis of type III collagen. This type of EDS is characterized by thin, translucent skin, wide, atrophic scars, and a tendency towards easy bruising and joint hypermobility, as well as a predisposition to arterial and intestinal ruptures. The incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis following a minor injury is also consistent with the increased fragility of bones seen in this condition.",Success
"A 21-year-old man comes to the emergency room with swelling and severe pain in his left lower leg that started 2 hours ago. He has no history of serious illness or trauma. His father has a history of pulmonary embolism. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily since he started college 3 years ago. He appears very distressed. He is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 92 kg (203 lb); BMI is 30.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a tender and mildly swollen left lower leg; dorsiflexion of the left foot causes severe pain in the calf. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 184,000/mm3, a prothrombin time of 11 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 26 seconds, and positive fibrin split products. Ultrasonography of the left leg shows incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow. The patient is administered a 5000 IU intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin followed by a constant infusion. Six hours later, the activated partial thromboplastin time is 30 seconds.

This patient presents with symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower leg, which is confirmed by ultrasonography showing incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow. The patient's history of a family member with a history of pulmonary embolism, smoking, and obesity are all risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Factor V Leiden is the most common inherited thrombophilia, which increases the risk of DVT and pulmonary embolism. The laboratory findings of positive fibrin split products are consistent with the diagnosis of DVT. The other options (A, B, D, and E) are also risk factors for venous thromboembolism, but Factor V Leiden is the most likely cause in this case.",Success
"An 80-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of fatigue and lightheadedness. He does not have chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing.

His lungs are clear to auscultation and bowel sounds are positive with no pulsatile masses or bruits. Pedal pulses are nonpalpable, distal extremities are cold, and capillary refill time is 4 seconds. An ECG shows left axis deviation, a Q wave in lead III, a constant PR interval of 0.15 seconds with every third P wave that is nonconducted, and a QRS interval of .09 seconds. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The most appropriate next step in management for this patient would be D. Cardiac pacing. The patient's symptoms, along with the ECG findings, suggest a high-grade AV block, specifically a third-degree AV block (also known as complete heart block). This is indicated by the constant PR interval with every third P wave nonconducted. In this condition, the electrical signals from the atria are not reaching the ventricles, leading to a slow heart rate and potentially causing symptoms such as fatigue, lightheadedness, and hypotension.

Cardiac pacing is indicated in cases of symptomatic high-grade AV block to maintain an adequate heart rate and improve hemodynamic stability. Pacing can be temporary, using a transvenous or transthoracic pacing wire, or permanent, with the placement of a pacemaker, depending on the patient's condition and the likelihood of the AV block resolving.

Options A, B, C, and E are vasopressors or inotropes that may be used to increase blood pressure or heart contractility, but they do not address the underlying issue of the AV block and would not be the most appropriate initial management for this patient.",Success
"In a small town with a population of 10,000 people, the prevalence of alcohol use is estimated to be 30%. A study is done with a null hypothesis that there is no association between alcohol use and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The data obtained shows, of the 200 alcoholics who were followed-up, 30 developed GERD; and out of the 400 non-alcoholics, 30 developed GERD. What fraction of GERD can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed in this town?",A,"To find the fraction of GERD that can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed, we need to calculate the attributable risk in the population (ARP). The ARP is the proportion of cases of a disease in a population that can be attributed to a specific risk factor (in this case, alcohol use).

Given:
- Population = 10,000
- Prevalence of alcohol use = 30% = 0.3
- Number of alcoholics = 200
- Number of non-alcoholics = 400
- Number of alcoholics who developed GERD = 30
- Number of non-alcoholics who developed GERD = 30

First, calculate the incidence of GERD among alcoholics and non-alcoholics:

Incidence among alcoholics = 30 / 200 = 0.15 or 15%
Incidence among non-alcoholics = 30 / 400 = 0.075 or 7.5%

Next, calculate the attributable risk in the exposed (ARE), which is the difference in risk between the exposed and unexposed groups:

ARE = Incidence among alcoholics - Incidence among non-alcoholics
ARE = 0.15 - 0.075 = 0.075

Then, calculate the population attributable risk (PAR), which is the proportion of all cases of GERD in the population that can be attributed to alcohol use:

PAR = (ARE / (Incidence among alcoholics)) * Prevalence of alcohol use
PAR = (0.075 / 0.15) * 0.3
PAR = 0.5 * 0.3
PAR = 0.15

This means that 15% of GERD cases in the population can be attributed to alcohol use.

Finally, to find the fraction of GERD that can be prevented if alcohol is no longer consumed, we can use the PAR:

Fraction of GERD prevented = PAR = 0.15

However, none of the options directly matches this calculation. The closest option that reflects the fraction of GERD cases in the population that can be attributed to alcohol use is:

D. (30/200) / (30/400)

This option represents the ratio of the incidence of GERD among alcoholics to the incidence of GERD among non-alcoholics, which is a component of the calculation for attributable risk but does not directly give the fraction of GERD cases that can be prevented in the population. The correct interpretation and calculation should lead to the PAR value, which is 0.15 or 15%, but this value is not directly represented among the given options. The question seems to ask for the PAR but provides options that do not directly represent this value.",Success
"A 41-year-old man presents to the clinic with the complaints of abdominal discomfort and cramping for the past 4 months.

Colonoscopy demonstrates continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon. What is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings is A. Ulcerative colitis. The continuous mucosal lesions from the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon, along with the symptoms of abdominal discomfort, cramping, and bloody stool, are characteristic of ulcerative colitis.

The patient's symptoms of pelvic pain, irritative voiding symptoms, and occasional blood in his semen with painful ejaculation, along with a mildly tender prostate on examination and no improvement with antimicrobial therapy, are consistent with chronic non-bacterial prostatitis. The negative urine and expressed prostatic secretion cultures also support this diagnosis, as they rule out bacterial infection as the cause of his symptoms.

After the splenic artery is ligated at its origin from the celiac trunk, the artery that will now be hypoperfused as a result is:

D. Left gastroepiploic artery

This is the recommended prophylaxis for newborns born to mothers who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive, regardless of the infant's serology status at birth.

Option C: Administer hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG is the correct choice.

The hepatitis B vaccine provides long-term protection, while HBIG offers immediate, passive immunity. Administering both within 12 hours of birth is crucial for maximizing the protection against hepatitis B infection. The vaccine should be given in a separate site from the HBIG to ensure adequate immune response to the vaccine.

Checking hepatitis B serology (Option D) and liver enzymes (Option E) can be useful for monitoring the mother's status and the infant's health, but these tests do not provide immediate protection against the virus. Administering only the vaccine (Option A) or only HBIG (Option B) would not provide the comprehensive protection that is necessary in this situation.",Success

Physical exam is notable for bilateral clear breath sounds, absence of lymphadenopathy on HEENT exam, and a normal oropharynx. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",E,"The patient's history of a recent respiratory illness followed by a persistent cough and occasional hemoptysis (blood in the sputum) warrants further investigation, particularly given that he is otherwise healthy and has no other alarming symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or fever. The absence of significant physical exam findings does not rule out a respiratory pathology.

The best next step in management would be to obtain a chest radiograph (Option A). A chest radiograph can help identify any lung abnormalities such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, or other infectious processes, as well as evaluate for conditions like lung cancer or other structural issues that might be causing the cough and hemoptysis.

While options B, C, and D (CT angiogram, D-dimer, and sputum culture) may be indicated in certain clinical scenarios (e.g., pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, or bacterial infection), they are not the first-line investigations for a patient with this presentation. A CT angiogram and D-dimer are typically reserved for patients with symptoms suggestive of a pulmonary embolism, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and risk factors for thrombosis. A sputum culture may be considered if there is evidence of a bacterial infection, but the patient's symptoms do not strongly suggest this.

Supportive care (Option E) is important for symptom management, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which needs to be determined through further diagnostic testing.

The fact that she has a history of taking medications for headaches, including sumatriptan and naproxen, does not necessarily point to a medication reaction as the cause of her current symptoms. Additionally, her history of panic attacks and suicide attempts does not explain the physical symptoms she is experiencing. A head CT will help confirm the diagnosis.",Success
A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine gynecological examination and to refill her birth control pills. Her last pap smear at age 22 showed no intraepithelial lesions nor malignancy of the cervical cells. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 4 days. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with one male partner. Her father died of colon cancer at the age of 75 years and her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40 years. She mentions that she is planning a backpacking trip through Europe in 2 months. Her routine immunizations are all up-to-date. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F) and her blood pressure is 94/58 mm Hg. Pelvic and speculum examination show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the best recommendation for the patient at this time?,A,"The best recommendation for the patient at this time would be A. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis screening. Given that the patient is sexually active with one partner, it is important to screen for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) as part of routine gynecological care. While her last pap smear was normal, STI screening is still recommended. Options B, C, D, and E are not indicated based on the information provided. A beta-hCG urine test is not necessary since she is not complaining of any symptoms of pregnancy and her menstrual cycle is regular. A repeat pap smear is not needed since her last one was normal and it is recommended to repeat every 3 years in women aged 21-65 years. Mammography is not indicated since she is only 24 years old and there are no symptoms or signs of breast cancer.

"A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient has a past medical history of asthma and cocaine use. His current medications include albuterol and ibuprofen. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 70/35 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On initial trauma evaluation, his airway is intact and he is breathing spontaneously. The patient's dorsalis pedis and radial pulses are palpable bilaterally. His Glasgow Coma Scale is 9. Head to toe examination reveals instability of the pelvis when downwards force is applied. The patient is started on IV fluids and norepinephrine, and a pelvic binder is placed. The patient's vitals are measured again and his temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 100/55 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. A blood transfusion is started, and the patient is given hydromorphone. The patient suddenly becomes short of breath with notable bilateral wheezing with poor air movement. His blood pressure is 60/35 mmHg and pulse is 160/min. The patient is treated appropriately, intubated, stabilized, and transferred to the surgical intensive care unit. Which of the following is most likely to be found in this patient's history?",A,"The patient's sudden onset of shortness of breath, bilateral wheezing, and poor air movement, accompanied by a drop in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate, suggest a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. Given the context of a blood transfusion and the patient's history of cocaine use, the most likely explanation is an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR) due to incompatible blood transfusion. This would be consistent with option E: Anti-A, B, or O antibodies in the serum.

An AHTR occurs when a patient receives blood with antigens that are incompatible with their own antibodies. In this case, the patient may have pre-existing antibodies against A, B, or O antigens in the serum, which can lead to hemolysis (destruction) of the transfused red blood cells. This can result in symptoms such as fever, chills, chest or back pain, shortness of breath, and hypotension, as seen in the patient.

The other options are less likely to be directly related to the patient's current presentation:

A. Hemolytic anemia and ataxia: Hemolytic anemia could be a consequence of an AHTR, but ataxia is not typically associated with this condition.
B. Gum disease and poor wound healing: These symptoms are not typically associated with the patient's acute presentation.
C. Irregularly irregular heart rhythm: This could indicate atrial fibrillation, which is not directly related to the patient's current presentation.
D. Hepatitis C infection: While possible given the patient's history of cocaine use (which may indicate intravenous drug use and associated risks), it is not the most likely explanation for the patient's acute presentation.

Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient's history is E. Anti-A, B, or O antibodies in the serum.",Success
An academic obstetrician is conducting a retrospective cohort study that evaluates the risk of placenta accreta at all statewide medical centers. Per chart review he finds that a prior cesarian birth is associated with a statistically significant increased risk of placenta accreta. The relative risk associated with this finding is 1.23.

Which of the following statements is the best interpretation of the reported association in the context of the study?,A,"The best interpretation of the reported association in the context of the study is:

None of the provided options (A through E) accurately describes the interpretation of the reported association. However, the closest correct interpretation from the given options would be a rephrased version of option D, which should state that there is a 3% probability of seeing the reported risk by chance alone (since the p-value is 0.03, which means there is a 3% chance of observing the data, or something more extreme, if the null hypothesis is true).

A correct interpretation would be: ""The p-value of 0.03 suggests that if there is no true association between prior cesarean birth and the risk of placenta accreta, there is a 3% chance of observing an association as strong as or stronger than the one found in the study by chance alone.""

To address the provided options specifically:
A. The 99% confidence interval is not mentioned in the information provided, so we cannot determine if it includes the null hypothesis.
B. The chance of bias is not indicated by the p-value; the p-value is a measure of the probability of observing the data under the null hypothesis.
C. The p-value does not represent the likelihood of seeing an increased risk of placenta accreta assuming the alternative hypothesis is true; it represents the probability of observing the data under the null hypothesis.
D. This option incorrectly states the probability; it should be 3% (0.03), not 23%.

C. Initiate nifedipine therapy

This patient is presenting with preterm labor at 26 weeks' gestation. The goal of management in this scenario is to delay delivery as much as possible to allow for fetal lung maturation and to improve neonatal outcomes. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that is commonly used as a tocolytic agent to inhibit uterine contractions and delay preterm labor. This will allow time for the administration of antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity and potentially for the transfer of the patient to a facility with a neonatal intensive care unit if necessary.

Diffuse oozing of the bladder mucosa with neovascularization is seen on cystoscopy. Which of the following could have prevented the patient’s condition?",B,"The patient's condition, characterized by hematuria and bladder mucosa changes, is suggestive of hemorrhagic cystitis. Among the options provided, ifosfamide is known to cause hemorrhagic cystitis as a side effect, especially when used at high doses or in the absence of prophylactic measures. Ifosfamide is a chemotherapy agent that can cause direct toxicity to the urothelium, leading to inflammation, hemorrhage, and necrosis of the bladder mucosa.

However, ifosfamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis can be prevented by administering mesna (mercaptopurine sodium), which is a uroprotective agent. Mesna works by scavenging the acrolein metabolites of ifosfamide that are responsible for the bladder toxicity. By administering mesna concurrently with ifosfamide, the risk of developing hemorrhagic cystitis can be significantly reduced.

Therefore, the correct answer to the question, ""Which of the following could have prevented the patient’s condition?"" is:

B. Mesna

It is important to note that the patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus and her current medications (ibuprofen and hydroxychloroquine) are not directly related to the development of hemorrhagic cystitis.

Which of the following arterial blood gas readings is most likely to be found in this patient?",C,"The patient in this scenario has ingested multiple substances, including aspirin, metoprolol, acetaminophen, levothyroxine, and lorazepam. Among these, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is known to cause metabolic acidosis due to its ability to inhibit the renal excretion of bicarbonate, leading to a decrease in serum bicarbonate levels and an increase in hydrogen ion concentration. Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a low pH, low bicarbonate (HCO3-), and a normal or low partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) as the lungs compensate for the acidosis by increasing ventilation to blow off CO2.

Given the patient's symptoms and the substances ingested, the most likely arterial blood gas (ABG) reading would reflect metabolic acidosis.

Which of the following findings would most likely be found on a bone marrow biopsy in this patient?",C,"The patient's symptoms, along with the laboratory findings, suggest a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia. The low hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red cell count, combined with the low MCV, MCH, and MCHC, indicate microcytic hypochromic anemia, which is characteristic of iron deficiency. The low reticulocyte count suggests that the bone marrow's response to anemia is inadequate. The iron studies show a high TIBC and low transferrin saturation, which are also consistent with iron deficiency.

In iron deficiency anemia, bone marrow biopsy would typically show decreased hemosiderin stores (option C). The bone marrow in iron deficiency anemia is usually normocellular to hypercellular, with erythroid hyperplasia and decreased iron stores. The other options listed do not typically correlate with iron deficiency anemia:

A. Hypocellularity with fatty infiltration is more commonly seen in aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.
B. Increased megakaryocytes can be seen in conditions such as essential thrombocythemia or myelofibrosis.
D. Ringed sideroblasts are a feature of sideroblastic anemia.

No fetal movement or cardiac activity are observed. She is advised to rest for a couple of hours, after which the scan is repeated. Slight downward migration of the gestational sac is observed with no change in the fetal status. Which of the following is the next step in management?",E,"The next step in management for this patient, given the clinical presentation and ultrasound findings, is:

E. Dilation and Curettage

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with an incomplete or inevitable abortion. The open cervical os, profuse bleeding, and the absence of fetal movement or cardiac activity on ultrasound are all indicative of this diagnosis. The downward migration of the gestational sac on repeat ultrasound further supports this. Dilation and curettage (D&C) is indicated to remove the remaining products of conception and to help control bleeding, prevent infection, and manage the patient's symptoms. Given the patient's hemodynamic instability (low blood pressure and tachycardia), immediate intervention is necessary to stabilize her condition. Antibiotics may be administered prophylactically during the procedure to prevent infection. Bed rest and analgesics alone would not be sufficient to manage the situation, and magnesium sulfate is typically used for the prevention and control of seizures in severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, not for abortion management.

Irreversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells. This mechanism is characteristic of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which are commonly used for the treatment of GERD due to their potent and long-lasting acid suppression properties. PPIs work by irreversibly inhibiting the proton pump (H+/K+-ATPase) on the parietal cells of the stomach, leading to a significant reduction in gastric acid secretion. This reduction in acid production helps to alleviate symptoms of GERD, such as heartburn and chest pain, and promotes healing of the esophageal lining.",Success

Minimal change disease is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children, which is characterized by heavy proteinuria (high levels of protein in the urine), hypoalbuminemia (low levels of albumin in the blood), hyperlipidemia (high levels of lipids in the blood), and edema (swelling). The presence of fatty casts in the urine is a result of the high levels of proteinuria and the associated loss of albumin, which normally binds to lipids in the blood. The loss of this binding capacity leads to the formation of fatty casts as the unbound lipids are excreted in the urine. Albuminuria is also a hallmark of MCD and would be expected to be found on urinalysis.",Success
"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.

Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?",A,"The conclusion stated does not suggest earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point-of-care ultrasound, but rather that the use of ultrasonography as an initial imaging modality did not result in significantly different outcomes in terms of high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations compared to CT. However, if we were to consider a scenario where earlier detection was a factor, the type of bias that might be exemplified in this context would be:

C. Lead-time bias

Lead-time bias occurs when a diagnostic test detects a condition earlier than it would have been detected with the standard method. This can make it seem like the intervention (in this case, point-of-care ultrasound) is more effective than it actually is, simply because the diagnosis is made earlier. However, lead-time bias does not necessarily imply that the patient's outcome will be improved; it only affects the apparent duration of the disease. In the context of this study, lead-time bias would not be applicable since the study did not find significant differences in outcomes between the imaging modalities.",Success
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of intermittent chest pain and palpitations. She also complains of dyspnea on exertion and has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss in the past 2 months despite normal appetite. She has no history of serious medical illness. Cardiac examination shows an irregularly irregular rhythm and a grade 3/6, low pitched, rumbling, mid-diastolic murmur heard best over the apex. Diffuse wheezing and bilateral rales are present in the lung bases. A transthoracic echocardiogram shows a left-ventricular ejection fraction of 40% and a mass in the left atrium. A biopsy of the mass is likely to show which of the following?",E,"The clinical presentation and echocardiogram findings suggest the presence of a cardiac tumor. Among the options provided, the most likely histopathological finding in a cardiac tumor would be:

B. Clusters of bland cells without mitotic activity

This description is most consistent with a myxoma, which is the most common primary cardiac tumor in adults. Myxomas are typically benign and can cause various symptoms, including those described in the question, due to their location and potential to embolize. They often present with a characteristic ""triple M"" syndrome: mitral valve dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, and mobile mass on the mitral valve. The echocardiogram showing a left atrial mass and the irregularly irregular rhythm could be due to atrial fibrillation, which is common in patients with myxomas due to the presence of the mass in the left atrium.",Success
"A 58-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent painful retrosternal dullness for 4 weeks. The pain is recurrent and occurs when she exerts herself or when she is outside during cold weather. She also experiences shortness of breath and palpitations during these episodes. The symptoms resolve spontaneously when she stops or sits down for a while. Over the past few days, the episodes have increased in frequency. She has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. Her left leg was amputated below the knee after a motorcycle accident 25 years ago. She is currently waiting for a new prosthesis and walks with crutches. Current medications include captopril, glyburide, and ibuprofen. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her pulse is 88/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 144/90 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm without any signs of ischemia. Serum cardiac markers are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",A,"The most appropriate next step in diagnosis for this patient would be:

A. Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress

The patient's symptoms are consistent with angina pectoris, which is often caused by coronary artery disease (CAD). The fact that her symptoms are triggered by exertion and cold weather, and resolve with rest, is characteristic of stable angina. Given her history of hypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for CAD, and the increase in frequency of her symptoms, a myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress would be appropriate to evaluate for ischemia in the heart muscle, which would suggest CAD.

An upper endoscopy (option B) would not be indicated as her symptoms are not suggestive of gastrointestinal issues. Coronary angiography (option C) is an invasive procedure and is usually reserved for patients with a high likelihood of significant CAD or those who are candidates for revascularization. An echocardiography at rest (option D) could be useful but would not provide information about the patient's cardiac function under stress. A repeat ECG under treadmill stress (option E) could be considered, but given her amputated leg and the use of crutches, a pharmacological stress test would be more feasible and safer.",Success
"A 24-year-old primigravida presents to her physician at 20 weeks gestation. She was diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria at her last appointment 2 weeks ago, and was treated with amoxicillin.

The uterus is enlarged to the umbilicus and the fetal heart rate is normal. Which of the following statements is the most accurate with respect to the presented case?",C,"The most accurate statement with respect to the presented case is:

B. Urinalysis should be performed on each subsequent antenatal visit to screen for possible recurrence of bacteriuria.

Explanation: Asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of developing symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) and pyelonephritis, which can lead to preterm labor and low birth weight. Therefore, it is recommended to screen for bacteriuria in pregnant women, and those who have had a previous episode should be screened at each antenatal visit to detect any recurrence. This proactive approach helps in the early detection and treatment of bacteriuria, reducing the risk of complications.",Success
"A 36-year-old G3P2 woman with no significant past medical history delivers a 3.7 kg (8 lb, 3 oz) baby boy following an uncomplicated pregnancy. On physical examination in the delivery room, the pediatrician notes that the baby has upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, a flat facial profile, small ears, a single palmar crease, and hypotonia. When discussing the diagnosis with the parents, which of the following is this baby at an increased risk for having?",B,"The baby's physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Down syndrome. Individuals with Down syndrome are at an increased risk for having congenital heart defects, including Tetralogy of Fallot (Option A), but the most common heart defect is an atrioventricular septal defect. They are also at increased risk for having congenital cataracts (Option C), which can lead to vision problems. Omphalocele (Option B), cleft lip (Option D), and macroorchidism (Option E) are not specific to Down syndrome, although cleft lip and palate can occur in any population and macroorchidism can be seen in individuals with Fragile X syndrome.

"A 30-year-old female presents to her primary care provider complaining of 4 days of fever, malaise, dyspnea, and productive cough and has recently developed pleuritic chest pain. Her past medical history is notable for asthma and takes albuterol as needed. She does not smoke but drinks alcohol socially. Her family history is notable for cystic fibrosis in her paternal uncle and interstitial lung disease in her paternal grandfather. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 21/min. Rales are noted in the right lower lung, and a chest radiograph demonstrates focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe. After initiating the appropriate treatment, she agrees to take part in a study assessing the immune response to lung infections. A protein is identified in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition. An amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated and a fluorescent marker is added to the sequence. This labeled sequence is subsequently added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient’s own neutrophils and macrophages and subsequently labeled with another fluorescent marker. The sequence binds strongly to this protein as evidenced by increased fluorescence in the gel. What process does this sequence typically undergo in immunocompetent individuals?",E,"The process that the amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein typically undergoes in immunocompetent individuals is not directly related to any of the options provided (A. Affinity maturation, B. Random assortment, C. Random nucleotide addition, D. VDJ recombination, E. Isotype switching) as described in the scenario. However, the closest process to what is described in the context of an immune response would be:

A. Affinity maturation

Affinity maturation is a process that occurs in the adaptive immune system where B cells that produce antibodies undergo somatic hypermutation and selection to increase the affinity of their antibodies for a specific antigen. This process is critical for the development of high-affinity antibodies during an immune response. In the scenario provided, the amino acid sequence binds strongly to a protein isolated from the patient's own neutrophils and macrophages, which could be indicative of an antibody or antibody-like molecule that has undergone affinity maturation to have a high affinity for its target.

The other options are not relevant to the scenario:

B. Random assortment - This refers to the random distribution of chromosomes during meiosis, which is not related to the scenario.
C. Random nucleotide addition - This can occur during VDJ recombination, but it is not the process that the amino acid sequence undergoes in the scenario.
D. VDJ recombination - This is the process by which B and T cell receptors are generated by rearranging gene segments, but it is not the process that the amino acid sequence undergoes in the scenario.
E. Isotype switching - This is the process by which B cells change the class of antibody they produce, but it is not the process that the amino acid sequence undergoes in the scenario.",Success

"A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 12 weeks estimated gestational age presents with malaise, joint pain, fever, and chills for the past 3 days. Physical examination reveals a mild lace-like rash and arthritis. The patient mentions her friend who is a medical student told her that her symptoms are suggestive of a parvovirus B19 infection which may adversely affect her baby. Which of the following statements regarding the effect of parvovirus B19 infection in this pregnant patient is correct?",A,"The correct statement regarding the effect of parvovirus B19 infection in a pregnant patient is:

A. It can lead to hydrops fetalis secondary to fetal anemia.

Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy can indeed have serious consequences for the fetus. The virus can cross the placenta and infect the fetal red blood cells, leading to fetal anemia. In severe cases, this can result in hydrops fetalis, a condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the fetal tissues and body cavities. Hydrops fetalis is a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention to prevent fetal death. The risk of hydrops fetalis is highest in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

B. It can cause aplastic crisis in the neonate.
Aplastic crisis refers to a sudden decrease in the production of red blood cells, which can occur in individuals with underlying hemolytic anemias when infected with parvovirus B19. However, this is not a common complication in neonates born to mothers who have had parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy.

C. Physical malformations are frequently associated with congenital infection.
There is no strong evidence to suggest that congenital parvovirus B19 infection leads to frequent physical malformations. While some studies have reported minor anomalies, these are not common or characteristic of the infection.

D. Fetal loss occurs in more than 40% of primary infections.
The risk of fetal loss due to parvovirus B19 infection varies depending on the gestational age at the time of infection. The risk is highest in the second trimester, but it is not as high as 40%. Studies have shown that the risk of fetal loss ranges from 2% to 6% in the first trimester and up to 30% in the second trimester.

E. The neonate may be born with a typical slapped-cheek rash.
The ""slapped-cheek"" rash is a characteristic sign of parvovirus B19 infection in children, but it is not typically seen in neonates. Neonates may present with other signs of infection, such as anemia or thrombocytopenia, but the slapped-cheek rash is not a common feature.",Success

Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s chest pain?",A,"The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's chest pain is D. Atherosclerotic plaque rupture. The patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and alcohol consumption are all risk factors for atherosclerosis. The sudden onset of chest pain, along with the ECG changes showing ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads, are indicative of an acute coronary syndrome, which is often caused by the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque leading to a thrombus formation and subsequent myocardial ischemia.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia with inappropriately high insulin levels and low C-peptide, suggest insulin administration as the cause. This, combined with the patient's young age and the fact that the episodes occur in a hospital setting, points to a caregiver, possibly the mother, intentionally causing the symptoms.

Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes and is caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina).

The development of diabetic retinopathy is associated with the polyol pathway, which is a minor metabolic pathway of glucose metabolism. Under normal conditions, the polyol pathway is not very active, but in conditions of hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels), such as in diabetes, the pathway becomes more active. The enzyme aldose reductase plays a key role in this pathway by converting glucose to sorbitol, which then accumulates in the retina and other tissues. The accumulation of sorbitol can lead to cellular damage and the development of diabetic complications, including retinopathy.

Therefore, the tissue-specific differences in the expression of the enzyme aldose reductase are likely responsible for the patient's symptoms. This enzyme is expressed more in certain tissues, such as the retina, lens, and peripheral nerves, which are particularly susceptible to diabetic complications.

The correct answer is:

A. Aldose reductase",Success

This rare genetic disorder is characterized by the presence of large cytoplasmic vacuoles in various cell types, including neutrophils. It is caused by mutations in the LYST gene, which affects the trafficking of lysosomal enzymes and other proteins within cells. Symptoms often include recurrent infections, light-colored skin, and silver or white hair. The other options do not match the clinical presentation and laboratory findings described.",Success
"A 48-year-old man with type II diabetes mellitus complicated by peripheral neuropathy presents to the emergency department for a foot wound that he noticed. He denies any pain, fevers, or chills. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 150/80 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 22/min. An ulcer with associated erythema and purulence is noted on his foot. Based on his radiography, he is diagnosed with osteomyelitis and admitted to the hospital for partial amputation of his right foot. He is given appropriate prophylaxis for tetanus and discharged 5 hospital days later on antibiotics. He returns to the emergency department one week later with difficulty breathing. His temperature is 98°F (37°C), blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, respirations are 27/min, and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. His amputated foot stump is erythematous and edematous but not tender to palpation. An electrocardiogram reveals sinus tachycardia. He requests something to help calm his breathing down. What is the next best step in management?",B,"The patient's symptoms of difficulty breathing, tachycardia, and hypoxia (oxygen saturation of 92% on room air) are concerning for a pulmonary embolism (PE). The erythema and edema of the amputated foot stump could be indicative of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a risk factor for PE. Given the patient's recent surgery and the presence of these symptoms, the next best step in management would be to evaluate for a PE.

Option B: CT angiography of the chest and give oxygen is the most appropriate choice. Oxygen will help to address the patient's hypoxia, and a CT angiography is a sensitive and specific test for diagnosing PE. If the CT angiography is positive for PE, anticoagulation therapy will be initiated immediately.

Option C: D-dimer and lower extremity Doppler ultrasound could also be considered, but they are not as definitive as a CT angiography for diagnosing PE. A D-dimer test can help rule out PE if it is negative, but a positive result does not confirm PE and would require further testing. A lower extremity Doppler ultrasound can diagnose DVT, which can lead to PE, but it does not diagnose PE itself.

Options A, D, and E are not indicated in this scenario. A complete blood count, type and screen, and ordering of blood (Option A) are not necessary unless there is evidence of active bleeding or anemia. Deep wound culture and starting piperacillin-tazobactam (Option D) are not indicated unless there is evidence of a deep wound infection, which is not the primary concern in this case. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and giving oxycodone (Option E) would not address the patient's respiratory distress and are not indicated in this scenario.",Success
"A 56-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-day history of sudden severe pain in his right great toe. Four months ago, he had an episode of severe joint pain involving his left knee that lasted several days and resolved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has a history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide and nephrolithiasis. Examination shows erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the right metatarsophalangeal joint; range of movement is limited by pain. His serum uric acid is 12 mg/dL. Arthrocentesis yields cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 18,500/mm3 (80% segmented neutrophils). Polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid is shown. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?",C,"The most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition, which is gout, is allopurinol. Allopurinol works by inhibiting xanthine oxidase, which is the enzyme that converts hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid. By inhibiting this enzyme, allopurinol reduces the production of uric acid, thereby lowering serum uric acid levels and preventing gout attacks. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe dyspnea, wheezing, and palpitations. His symptoms began approx. 20 minutes after being stung by a bee on the left arm. Past medical history is significant for hypertension for which he takes labetalol. While being questioned, the patient becomes obtunded. His vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F); blood pressure 85/55 mm Hg; pulse 110/min; respiratory rate 31/min; and oxygen saturation 90% on room air. On physical examination, an area of severe edema and erythema is noted on the extensor surface of the left forearm, and there is severe angioedema of the face and neck. The patient is intubated, and aggressive fluid resuscitation and intramuscular epinephrine are administered. A repeat blood pressure is 90/55 mm Hg, despite these efforts. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",B,"The patient's presentation is consistent with anaphylaxis, a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. The first-line treatment for anaphylaxis is intramuscular epinephrine, which the patient has already received. Despite this, the patient's blood pressure remains low (90/55 mm Hg), indicating ongoing shock. The next best step in the management of this patient would be to administer a vasopressor to help maintain blood pressure and perfusion to vital organs.

Option E, administering norepinephrine, is the correct answer. Norepinephrine is a potent vasoconstrictor and is the vasopressor of choice for the treatment of hypotension in anaphylaxis when epinephrine alone is not sufficient to maintain blood pressure. It can be administered intravenously as a continuous infusion.

Options A (dopamine) and B (glucagon) are not the first choices for anaphylaxis management. Dopamine can be used in certain cases of hypotension, but it is not as effective as norepinephrine for severe anaphylactic shock. Glucagon is used for the treatment of hypoglycemia and is not indicated in this scenario.

Option C (dexamethasone) and Option D (diphenhydramine and ranitidine) are corticosteroids and antihistamines, respectively. While these medications can be used in the management of anaphylaxis to prevent a late-phase allergic reaction or to treat symptoms not controlled by epinephrine, they do not have immediate effects on blood pressure and are not the next best step in managing this patient's hypotension.",Success
"A 74-year-old man has been treated for prostate cancer for the past 6 months. He is on an experimental drug (drug X) that is used to reduce the action of testosterone by blocking the androgen receptor. Since the initiation of therapy, the growth of the cancerous tissue has slowed. This medication is known to be excreted by the kidneys at the current dose that he is taking.

Which of the following drugs most likely belongs to be the same class as drug X?",C,"The drug that most likely belongs to the same class as drug X, which is used to reduce the action of testosterone by blocking the androgen receptor, is:

C. Flutamide

Flutamide is an antiandrogen that works by blocking the action of androgens like testosterone. It is used in the treatment of prostate cancer by inhibiting the growth of cancer cells that are sensitive to androgens. Like drug X, it does not directly inhibit the production of testosterone but rather blocks its action at the receptor level.",Success
"A 74-year-old man was admitted to the hospital after falling down several stairs. He is a known alcoholic. He was started on IV fluids and received a head CT, which was negative.

Which of the following electrolyte imbalances was most likely corrected too aggressively?",A,"The symptoms described in the patient, including inability to move his arms and legs, difficulty chewing, swallowing, moving his face, and speaking, suggest a neurological issue. Among the options provided, the electrolyte imbalance that can lead to such symptoms when corrected too aggressively is:

A. Hyponatremia

Rapid correction of hyponatremia (low sodium levels) can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome (previously known as central pontine myelinolysis), which can cause neurological symptoms such as those described. This condition occurs when the brain cells are damaged due to a rapid shift of water out of the cells as sodium levels are corrected too quickly. Therefore, the most likely answer is A.

"A previously healthy 67-year-old man comes to the physician for routine health maintenance evaluation. He works at a community center and volunteers at a local homeless shelter. A tuberculin skin test shows an induration of 14 mm. An x-ray of the chest is normal. Treatment with an antimycobacterial drug is initiated. Two months later, he has numbness and burning over both feet and an unsteady gait. Physical examination shows decreased sensation to light touch extending from the soles of the feet to the mid-shin bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s current symptoms?",A,"The patient's symptoms of numbness and burning in the feet, along with an unsteady gait and decreased sensation to light touch extending from the soles of the feet to the mid-shin bilaterally, are most consistent with peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy can be caused by various factors, including nutritional deficiencies, infections, and exposure to certain medications.

Given that the patient was initiated on an antimycobacterial drug for treatment of latent tuberculosis (as suggested by the positive tuberculin skin test), the most likely cause of his symptoms is an adverse reaction to the medication. Among the antimycobacterial drugs, isoniazid (INH) is known to cause peripheral neuropathy as a side effect. Isoniazid interferes with the metabolism of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), leading to a deficiency that can result in peripheral neuropathy.

None of the provided options (A through E) directly relate to the mechanism by which isoniazid causes peripheral neuropathy. However, the closest match to the pathophysiology of isoniazid-induced neuropathy is:

C. Segmental demyelination of peripheral axons

While this option does not specifically mention isoniazid or vitamin B6 deficiency, it describes the structural change that occurs in peripheral neuropathy, which can result from various causes, including medication side effects. The segmental demyelination leads to impaired nerve conduction and the clinical symptoms of neuropathy.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's current symptoms is:

C. Segmental demyelination of peripheral axons

It is important to note that the patient should be evaluated for vitamin B6 deficiency and may require supplementation to prevent or treat the peripheral neuropathy.",Success

He states that he has minimal morning stiffness, lasting approximately 5-10 minutes after waking up most days. Physical examination reveals tenderness to palpation of the bony structures on the medial aspect of the bilateral knees as well as crepitus and a decreased range of motion, limited at the extremes of flexion and extension. Both knee joints are cool to touch and exhibit bony enlargement upon palpation of the medial joint line. Which of the following studies would be indicated for further work-up of this patient's presenting condition?",E,"Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, which are consistent with osteoarthritis, the most appropriate initial imaging study would be an X-ray of the bilateral knees. However, this option is not listed among the choices provided. Among the options given, an MRI of the knee (Option D) could provide detailed images of the knee joints, including cartilage, ligaments, and bone surfaces, which can help confirm the diagnosis of osteoarthritis and rule out other potential causes of knee pain. However, an MRI is typically not the first-line imaging study for osteoarthritis due to its cost and availability.

For further work-up, options that can help rule out inflammatory arthritis include an Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and Rheumatoid Factor (RF) (Options B and C). An elevated ESR can indicate inflammation, which is not typically seen in osteoarthritis but can be present in conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. A positive RF is also more commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis.

A Complete Blood Count (CBC) (Option A) is not typically indicated for the work-up of knee pain, as it does not provide specific information about joint conditions.

Given the options provided, the most appropriate choices for further work-up would be:

B. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
C. Rheumatoid factor (RF)

These tests can help differentiate between osteoarthritis and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, if an X-ray was an available option, it would be the most appropriate initial study to confirm the diagnosis of osteoarthritis.",Success

Which of the following would have been most effective in preventing this patient's current symptoms?""",E,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest that he is experiencing tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a complication that can occur in patients with leukemia or lymphoma, particularly when the tumor burden is high. TLS is characterized by the rapid destruction of tumor cells, which can lead to hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia, and hypocalcemia, as well as acute kidney injury.

Given the patient's laboratory results, which show elevated potassium, phosphorus, and uric acid levels, as well as decreased calcium levels, the most likely diagnosis is TLS. The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle cramps are consistent with the electrolyte abnormalities seen in TLS.

The most effective treatment for preventing TLS is allopurinol (option D), which is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that reduces the production of uric acid. Allopurinol is typically started prophylactically in patients with high-risk hematological malignancies before chemotherapy is initiated to prevent TLS. Rasburicase (option C) is another urate-lowering agent that can be used for the same purpose, but it is not as widely used as allopurinol due to concerns about hypersensitivity reactions.

Urine alkalinization (option A) is not typically used to prevent TLS, although it may be used to treat it by promoting the excretion of uric acid. Corticosteroids (option B) are not indicated for the prevention of TLS. Intravenous hydration (option E) is important in the management of TLS to maintain renal perfusion and prevent acute kidney injury, but it is not the primary preventive measure.

Explanation: The patient's early onset of puberty (precocious puberty) at 7 years of age, as indicated by Tanner stage 3 breast development and pubic hair, can lead to a number of potential health issues. Among the options provided, osteoporosis is the most likely long-term risk associated with precocious puberty. Early onset of puberty can lead to accelerated bone maturation and closure of the growth plates, which may result in a shorter final height than expected (option B, short stature) and potentially decreased bone density over time, increasing the risk of osteoporosis in adulthood. The other options (A, C, and E) are not directly associated with precocious puberty.",Success
"A 67-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a follow up appointment. He was released from the hospital 1 week ago for an appropriately managed ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); however, he has not filled any of his prescriptions and did not attend his follow up appointment as scheduled. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. His temperature is 97.5°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 167/118 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air.

Which of the following medications will have the greatest mortality benefit in this patient?",D,"The medication that will have the greatest mortality benefit in this patient is D. Metoprolol succinate. Metoprolol succinate is a beta-blocker that has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with a history of myocardial infarction, particularly in those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction or heart failure. It helps to reduce the workload on the heart by decreasing heart rate and contractility, which can improve outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease and hypertension. While lisinopril (option C) is also beneficial in reducing mortality in patients with heart failure and hypertension, beta-blockers like metoprolol have a more direct impact on reducing mortality in post-MI patients.",Success
A 61-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of a productive cough and worsening shortness of breath. He has had frequent episodes of a productive cough over the past 3 years. He had smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit 1 year ago. He appears distressed. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. Chest auscultation reveals diffuse wheezes and coarse crackles. A chest x-ray shows increased lung lucency bilaterally and flattening of the diaphragm. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy?,A,"The most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for this patient, given his history of chronic productive cough, smoking history, and current presentation with shortness of breath, wheezes, and crackles, along with chest x-ray findings consistent with emphysema, would be:

A. Prednisone and albuterol

Prednisone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation in the airways, which is beneficial in exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a condition this patient likely has based on his history and symptoms. Albuterol is a short-acting beta-2 agonist that provides quick relief of bronchospasm, making it useful for immediate symptom relief in acute exacerbations of COPD.

The other options are less appropriate as initial therapy for an acute exacerbation:

B. Albuterol and montelukast: Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist used for long-term control of asthma, not typically used for acute exacerbations of COPD.
C. Prednisone and tiotropium: Tiotropium is a long-acting anticholinergic used for maintenance therapy in COPD, not for acute exacerbations.
D. Albuterol and theophylline: Theophylline is a bronchodilator used for long-term control of asthma and COPD, but it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for acute exacerbations due to its narrow therapeutic index and potential side effects.
E. Roflumilast and prednisone: Roflumilast is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor used for maintenance therapy in severe COPD, not for acute exacerbations.",Success
An investigator is studying cellular regeneration of epithelial cells. She has obtained a tissue sample from a normal thyroid gland for histopathologic examination. It shows follicles lined by a single layer of cube-like cells with large central nuclei. Which of the following parts of the female reproductive tract is also lined by this type of epithelium?,A,"The type of epithelium described in the question is simple cuboidal epithelium, which is characterized by a single layer of cube-like cells with large central nuclei. This type of epithelium is found in various parts of the body, including the lining of the thyroid gland follicles as mentioned.

In the female reproductive tract, simple cuboidal epithelium is found in the fallopian tubes (option C). The fallopian tubes are lined with ciliated simple columnar epithelium in the lumen, but the underlying layer is simple cuboidal epithelium. This type of epithelium plays a role in the transport and protection of the ova as they move from the ovaries to the uterus.

Here is a brief explanation of the other options:

A. Ovaries: The ovaries are not lined with simple cuboidal epithelium. They are covered by a layer of epithelium that is typically simple cuboidal or simple columnar, but this is not the primary type of epithelium found within the ovaries.

B. Vagina: The vagina is lined with stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium, which is different from simple cuboidal epithelium.

D. Vulva: The vulva is lined with stratified squamous keratinized epithelium, which is also different from simple cuboidal epithelium.

E. Cervix: The cervix has two types of epithelium: the ectocervix is lined with stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium, and the endocervix is lined with simple columnar epithelium with mucus-secreting cells. Neither of these is simple cuboidal epithelium.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

C. Fallopian tubes",Success
"A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine health examination. She feels well but asks for advice about smoking cessation. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 7 years. She has tried to quit several times without success. During the previous attempts, she has been extremely nervous and also gained weight. She has also tried nicotine lozenges but stopped taking them because of severe headaches and insomnia. She has bulimia nervosa. She takes no medications. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The most appropriate next step in management for this patient would be option D: Motivational interviewing. Given her history of failed attempts to quit smoking, including adverse reactions to nicotine replacement therapy (lozenges), and her history of bulimia nervosa, motivational interviewing can be an effective approach to help her address her smoking cessation goals. This technique helps patients explore and resolve their ambivalence about behavior change, which can be particularly useful in someone with a history of mental health issues like bulimia nervosa. It can also help address her concerns about weight gain during smoking cessation.

Options A (Diazepam) and E (Fluoxetine) are medications that could potentially be used to treat anxiety and depression, respectively, but they are not first-line treatments for smoking cessation. Option B (Nicotine patch) might be considered, but given her previous adverse reactions to nicotine replacement therapy, it may not be the best initial choice.

What is her New York Heart Association Functional Classification for congestive heart failure?",D,"The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification system is used to categorize the extent of heart disease based on the impact of physical activity on patients. The classification is as follows:

- Class I: Patients with heart disease who have no limitation of physical activity; ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea (shortness of breath).
- Class II: Patients with heart disease resulting in a slight limitation of physical activity; they are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.
- Class III: Patients with heart disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity; they are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.
- Class IV: Patients with heart disease who cannot carry on any physical activity without discomfort; symptoms of heart failure may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.

Based on the patient's description, she is no longer able to go for short walks and even simple tasks like getting ready in the morning have become burdensome for her.

Which of the following statements best describes the cause of this patient’s glucosuria?",C,"The cause of this patient's glucosuria is best described by option C: Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules. 

In the kidneys, glucose is filtered through the glomerulus and is then reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. This reabsorption is a secondary active transport process that is coupled with the reabsorption of sodium ions. Normally, all the filtered glucose is reabsorbed, but in patients with hyperglycemia, as in this case, the concentration of glucose in the blood exceeds the reabsorption capacity of the renal tubules, leading to glucosuria. The HbA1c level of 9% indicates poorly controlled diabetes, which is consistent with hyperglycemia causing the glucosuria.

Which of the following underlies the patient’s most likely diagnosis?",D,"Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is related to polycythemia, which is indicated by the elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Polycythemia can be caused by various factors, including chronic hypoxia, which can be due to living at high altitude, or it can be a primary condition known as polycythemia vera, a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm.

The patient's headache, dizziness, and nausea are common symptoms of polycythemia due to the increased viscosity of the blood, which can lead to decreased cerebral perfusion and hypoxia. The fact that the patient's symptoms improve when he goes outside to shovel snow suggests that his symptoms may be related to a lack of oxygen, which is consistent with polycythemia.

Given the laboratory results and the patient's symptoms, the most likely underlying diagnosis is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (Option B). This condition would explain the elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels and the patient's symptoms. It is important to rule out other causes of secondary polycythemia, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sleep apnea, or smoking, but the patient denies smoking and has no history of lung disease.

A week after discharge, the patient forgot to take her medication for a few days and quickly began to manifest manic symptoms again which required brought her to the emergency department again. Since then, she has been compliant with her medications and currently has no significant complaints. Which of the following recommendations would be most helpful in minimizing the risk to the fetus in this patient?",A,"The question presents a scenario involving a 20-year-old woman with bipolar I disorder who was recently diagnosed and treated with lithium. The patient had an episode of noncompliance that led to a relapse of her manic symptoms. Given her reproductive age and the potential for pregnancy, the question asks which recommendation would be most helpful in minimizing the risk to the fetus in this patient.

Let's evaluate each option:

A. Adjust dosage of medication throughout the pregnancy: This is a reasonable recommendation, as the needs for medication can change during pregnancy due to physiological changes. However, this option does not address the initial risk of taking lithium during pregnancy.

B. Supplement all patients with 5mg of daily folic acid: Folic acid supplementation is recommended for all women of childbearing age to reduce the risk of neural tube defects in the fetus. This is a good recommendation, but it does not specifically address the risks associated with lithium use during pregnancy.

C. Low-dose polytherapy is preferred over monotherapy: This statement is not necessarily true. Polytherapy (using multiple medications) can increase the risk of adverse effects on the fetus, and the goal is often to use the lowest effective dose of a single medication when possible.

D. Discontinue the medication when conception is confirmed: Discontinuing lithium during pregnancy can be risky for the mother's health due to the high risk of relapse in bipolar disorder. This option does not consider the potential for unplanned pregnancies or the risk of relapse.

E. Switch to valproate as it has the safest pregnancy profile: This statement is incorrect. Valproate has been associated with a higher risk of major congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders in the fetus compared to other mood stabilizers. It is not considered to have the safest pregnancy profile.

Given the options provided, the most helpful recommendation in minimizing the risk to the fetus would be:

B. Supplement all patients with 5mg of daily folic acid

This recommendation is the most directly related to minimizing fetal risk, although it does not address the medication management aspect. However, the other options either carry higher risks or are not as directly related to minimizing fetal risk. It is important to note that the management of bipolar disorder in women of childbearing age should involve a multidisciplinary approach, including discussions about contraception, family planning, and the risks and benefits of medication use during pregnancy.",Success

"A 72-year-old man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital for the evaluation of breathlessness and fatigue. His pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Further evaluation shows a systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg × min/L with an end-systolic volume of 80 mL. Which of the following describes the ejection fraction in this patient?",E,"To determine the ejection fraction (EF) in this patient, we need to use the formula:

\[ EF = \frac{Stroke\ Volume}{End\ Diastolic\ Volume} \times 100\% \]

However, we only have the end-systolic volume (ESV) given as 80 mL. We do not have the end-diastolic volume (EDV) directly, but we can calculate the stroke volume (SV) and then estimate the EDV if we make some assumptions.

The stroke volume can be calculated using the cardiac output (CO) and the heart rate (HR). The cardiac output can be estimated from the blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) using the formula:

\[ CO = \frac{BP \times 80}{SVR + 40} \]

Where BP is the mean arterial pressure (MAP). The mean arterial pressure can be estimated from the systolic and diastolic blood pressures using the formula:

\[ MAP = \frac{(Systolic\ BP + 2 \times Diastolic\ BP)}{3} \]

For this patient, the systolic BP is not given directly, but we can estimate it from the diastolic BP and the pulse pressure (difference between systolic and diastolic BP). The pulse pressure is usually around 40 mmHg in a healthy adult, but it can be lower in this case given the patient's condition. Assuming a pulse pressure of 40 mmHg, the systolic BP would be 130 mmHg (90 mmHg + 40 mmHg). Thus, the MAP would be:

\[ MAP = \frac{(130 + 2 \times 60)}{3} = \frac{250}{3} = 83.33\ mmHg \]

Now, we can estimate the cardiac output:

\[ CO = \frac{83.33 \times 80}{35 + 40} = \frac{6666.4}{75} = 88.88\ L/min \]

However, this is a very high cardiac output for a patient with these symptoms, and it is likely that the actual cardiac output is much lower. The heart rate is given as 100/min, so we can use this to estimate the stroke volume:

\[ SV = \frac{CO}{HR} = \frac{88.88}{100} = 0.8888\ L = 888.8\ mL \]

This stroke volume is also unrealistically high, suggesting that our initial assumptions or calculations may be off. Given the patient's condition, it is more likely that the cardiac output is lower, and the stroke volume is closer to a normal range.

Assuming a more realistic stroke volume of 70 mL (which is within the normal range for an adult), we can now estimate the end-diastolic volume:

\[ SV = EDV - ESV \]

\[ 70 = EDV - 80 \]

This equation does not make sense because the end-systolic volume cannot be greater than the end-diastolic volume. This indicates that we have made an error in our assumptions or calculations.

Given the information provided and without more specific details, we cannot accurately calculate the ejection fraction. However, we can estimate that if the end-systolic volume is 80 mL and assuming a normal stroke volume of around 70 mL, the end-diastolic volume would be around 150 mL (70 mL + 80 mL). Using this estimation:

\[ EF = \frac{70}{150} \times 100\% = 46.67\% \]

This value is not among the options provided, suggesting that the information given is incomplete or that additional assumptions are required to estimate the ejection fraction accurately. Based on the options provided, none of them directly match this estimated value, but given the patient's conditions, it is likely that the ejection fraction is reduced, which would suggest options A, B, D, or E. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact ejection fraction from the given options.",Success

Which of the following is the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient?",D,"The patient's presentation is consistent with acute mastoiditis with complications of sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo. Given her symptoms and physical examination findings, an antibiotic that covers both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria is needed, as mastoiditis is often caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, which are common causes of acute otitis media that can lead to mastoiditis.

Cefotaxime (Option C) is a third-generation cephalosporin that is effective against a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including those commonly responsible for mastoiditis. It is also able to penetrate the meninges and mastoid bone, making it a suitable choice for this condition.

Ofloxacin (Option A) is a fluoroquinolone that is effective against a wide range of bacteria but is generally not the first-line treatment for mastoiditis due to concerns about increasing resistance.

Cefepime (Option B) is a fourth-generation cephalosporin that is also broad-spectrum but is typically reserved for more serious or complicated infections, and its use for mastoiditis would be less common than cefotaxime.

Amoxicillin (Option D) is a penicillin that is effective against many bacteria but may not provide adequate coverage for all potential pathogens in mastoiditis, especially in cases of antibiotic resistance.

Cephalexin (Option E) is a first-generation cephalosporin that is less effective against some of the more resistant bacteria that can cause mastoiditis and is less likely to penetrate the mastoid bone effectively.

Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the need for an antibiotic that can effectively treat mastoiditis and penetrate the mastoid bone, cefotaxime (Option C) is the most appropriate choice.",Success
"A 52-year-old woman presents to the emergency department due to severe pain of her first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. This pain started acutely, and she describes the pain as sharp. Her medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, and extensive alcohol use. She takes a number of medications but does not remember what they are. On physical exam, her right first MTP joint appears warm, swollen, erythematous, and exquisitely painful to the touch. After resolution of this acute episode, the patient is started on a drug to prevent recurrence of the symptoms. One month later on follow-up, she is found to have pancytopenia. Which of the following describes the mechanism of the drug most likely prescribed in this case?",D,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of acute gouty arthritis, which is often triggered by high levels of uric acid in the blood (hyperuricemia). The medication that is commonly prescribed to prevent recurrence of gout symptoms by reducing uric acid levels is allopurinol, which is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (Option D). Xanthine oxidase is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of purines, which leads to the production of uric acid. By inhibiting this enzyme, allopurinol reduces the production of uric acid, thereby decreasing the risk of gout attacks.

Pancytopenia, which is a decrease in all three types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets), can be a rare but serious side effect of allopurinol. This adverse effect is thought to occur due to an idiosyncratic reaction leading to bone marrow suppression. Therefore, the mechanism of the drug most likely prescribed in this case, which can lead to pancytopenia, is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (Option D).",Success
"A 59-year-old man complains of chest pain that has been present for 4 hours on the 5th day of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. 5 days ago, he had a burning sensation in his chest and discomfort in his left shoulder. Upon initial presentation to the hospital’s emergency department, he was diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and treated with alteplase. He has been under close observation since then. The patient now describes discomfort in his chest and left shoulder, somewhat similar in nature to what initially brought him into the hospital. A pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and a blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg are observed. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings. The patient’s ECG is difficult to interpret. Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility?",C,"The most diagnostic utility in this scenario would be provided by option E, Troponin T. Troponin T is a cardiac biomarker that is released into the bloodstream when heart muscle cells are damaged, such as during a myocardial infarction. It has high sensitivity and specificity for myocardial injury and is often used to diagnose acute coronary syndromes, including myocardial infarction. Since the patient is presenting with symptoms similar to those he experienced during his initial myocardial infarction, an elevated Troponin T level would suggest that he may be experiencing recurrent myocardial ischemia or infarction. This information would be critical for guiding further diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.",Success
"A 16-year-old girl comes to the emergency department because of left wrist pain and swelling for 5 hours. She fell on an outstretched hand while playing basketball. She ignored it initially as she thought it was just a bruise, but the pain and swelling worsened throughout the day. The analgesic spray she used did not provide adequate relief. There is no family history of serious illness. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive pill. Her immunizations are up-to-date. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37.1°C (99°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg. Examination shows a swollen and tender left wrist; range of motion is limited. The anatomical snuffbox is tender to palpation. The grip strength of the left hand is decreased. The thumb can be opposed towards the other fingers. Finkelstein's test is negative. X-rays of the wrist shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?",C,"The most appropriate next best step in management for this patient is:

C. Thumb spica cast and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks

The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with a possible scaphoid fracture, which can be difficult to diagnose on initial x-rays. The tenderness over the anatomical snuffbox is a key sign of a scaphoid fracture. Scaphoid fractures are often not visible on initial x-rays and may require repeat imaging in 1-2 weeks to confirm the diagnosis. In the meantime, immobilization with a thumb spica cast is recommended to prevent further injury and promote healing if a fracture is present.",Success

Serum studies show a total bilirubin concentration of 3.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin concentration of 2.5 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase level of 450 U/L. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography shows focal areas of intrahepatic bile duct strictures alternating with areas of dilation. Histologic examination of a liver biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?",A,"The patient's symptoms, laboratory findings, and imaging results are most consistent with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a chronic inflammatory disease of the bile ducts that often occurs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis. The characteristic imaging finding of alternating strictures and dilations of the bile ducts on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is highly suggestive of PSC.

The histologic examination of a liver biopsy in PSC typically shows periductal concentric scarring and fibrosis (Option A). This finding is known as ""onion-skin"" fibrosis, where there is a concentric arrangement of fibrous tissue around the bile ducts. This pattern of fibrosis is characteristic of PSC and differentiates it from other liver diseases.

Options B, C, D, and E do not accurately describe the histologic findings typically seen in PSC.

She has had 5 sexual partners in the past year and uses the pull-out method for contraception. She has a 10-pack-year smoking history and drinks 10-12 alcoholic beverages per week. On exam, she has an ulcerated, tender, and purulent ulcer on the left labia majora. The patient has mild unilateral painful inguinal lymphadenopathy. This patient's condition is most likely caused by which of the following pathogens?",C,"The patient's presentation of a painful, swollen lesion on the left labia majora, which is ulcerated and purulent, along with mild unilateral painful inguinal lymphadenopathy, is most suggestive of a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Among the options provided, the most likely pathogen responsible for this presentation is Haemophilus ducreyi, which is the causative agent of chancroid.

Chancroid is characterized by painful genital ulcers and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, which can progress to bubo formation (suppurative enlargement of the lymph nodes). The other options do not fit the clinical presentation as well:

A. Klebsiella granulomatis (Donovanosis) typically presents with painless, beefy red, granulomatous ulcers that tend to bleed easily and can grow and spread if left untreated.

B. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) can cause painful genital ulcers, but they are often accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, myalgia, and malaise during the primary infection. Additionally, HSV ulcers tend to have a vesicular stage before ulceration, and they may be associated with satellite lesions.

D. Gardnerella vaginalis is associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV), which typically presents with a thin, white or gray vaginal discharge with a ""fishy"" odor, rather than a localized painful ulcer.

E. Treponema pallidum causes syphilis, which can present with a painless chancre during the primary stage. The chancre is usually clean-based and not purulent. Syphilis does not typically cause painful lymphadenopathy during the primary stage.

Therefore, the most likely pathogen causing this patient's condition is Haemophilus ducreyi (Option C).",Success
"A 67-year-old man presents with feelings of nervousness and anxiety. He mentions that lately, he has been feeling increasingly restless and is unable to control feelings of nervousness pertaining to all his daily tasks. He noticed that these feelings were more prominent in the last 2 months but have been present on and off for the last year. On many occasions, his mind will be racing with thoughts that keep him up at night. During these moments, he finds his heart racing and feels light-headed and dizzy to the point of blacking out. He has also been experiencing back and neck pain with increased muscle tension in these areas. The patient reports no smoking or alcohol use but mentions that he had tried cocaine and heroin in his 20s and 30s. Which of the following would be the best course of treatment for this patient’s symptoms?",D,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), characterized by excessive anxiety and worry about various aspects of life, restlessness, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. The patient also reports symptoms of panic attacks, such as heart racing, lightheadedness, and dizziness. Given the patient's history of substance use, it is important to consider the potential for dependence and addiction when choosing a treatment.

Among the options provided, Diazepam (A), Zolpidem (B), and Alprazolam (E) are benzodiazepines, which are effective for anxiety but have a high potential for dependence and abuse, especially in individuals with a history of substance use. Ramelteon (C) is a melatonin receptor agonist used primarily for insomnia, and while it may help with sleep disturbances, it does not address the core symptoms of anxiety.

Buspirone (D) is an azapirone that is specifically indicated for the treatment of GAD and has a lower potential for dependence and abuse compared to benzodiazepines. It is generally well-tolerated and can be used for long-term management of anxiety.

"Two hours after undergoing open cholecystectomy for complicated cholecystitis, a 48-year-old woman develops dizziness, lethargy, abdominal pain, and nausea. She has systemic lupus erythematosus and hypertension. Prior to hospitalization, her medications included nifedipine and prednisolone. Her pulse is 112/min and blood pressure is 90/64 mm Hg. Examination shows central obesity. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and the laparoscopic incisions have no discharge. Her serum cortisol and serum ACTH are decreased. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?",E,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are most consistent with adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease. This can be a complication of long-term glucocorticoid therapy, such as with prednisolone, which the patient was taking. Adrenal insufficiency can lead to a number of electrolyte abnormalities, but the most characteristic is hyponatremia (low sodium levels) due to the mineralocorticoid deficiency that accompanies adrenal insufficiency. This is because mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone, are responsible for sodium retention and potassium excretion. Without sufficient mineralocorticoids, sodium is not retained properly, leading to hyponatremia, and potassium is not excreted efficiently, which could lead to hyperkalemia, but hyponatremia is the more characteristic finding in this scenario.

"A 63-year-old female complains of weakness, light-headedness, palpitations, and soreness of the tongue. She has a past medical history of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Her hematocrit is 29%. On peripheral blood smear, you notice neutrophils with 7 lobes and large oval-shaped red blood cells. On physical exam, you notice the patient has decreased position sense and a loss in vibratory sensation in her lower extremities. Which of the following is most likely present in this patient?",B,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, which is often associated with pernicious anemia. Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune condition where the body produces antibodies against intrinsic factor, a protein produced by the parietal cells of the stomach that is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum. Without intrinsic factor, vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed, leading to a deficiency.

The symptoms described, including weakness, light-headedness, palpitations, and soreness of the tongue, are common in vitamin B12 deficiency. The hematocrit of 29% indicates anemia. The presence of neutrophils with 7 lobes (referred to as hypersegmented neutrophils) and large oval-shaped red blood cells (macrocytosis) on the peripheral blood smear are characteristic findings in vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. The neurological symptoms, such as decreased position sense and loss of vibratory sensation in the lower extremities, are also indicative of vitamin B12 deficiency, which can lead to neurological complications.

Therefore, the most likely answer is:

B. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies

This condition is not related to atrophy of G cells (option A), which are responsible for secreting gastrin, a hormone that stimulates gastric acid secretion. Decreased methylmalonic acid levels (option C) would not be expected in vitamin B12 deficiency, as methylmalonic acid levels actually increase in B12 deficiency. An antithrombotic state (option D) is not associated with the patient's symptoms or findings. B12 malabsorption due to Diphyllobothrium latum (option E) can cause vitamin B12 deficiency but is less common than pernicious anemia and is not indicated by the presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies.",Success

C. Manual uterine aspiration

Manual uterine aspiration (MUA) is a safe and effective method for terminating early pregnancies, typically up to 7 weeks of gestation. It is a simple procedure that can be performed in an outpatient setting under local anesthesia. MUA involves the use of a manual syringe to create suction and remove the contents of the uterus.

Option E (oral mifepristone + misoprostol) is also a viable option for early pregnancy termination, usually up to 10 weeks of gestation. However, in the context of this patient's early pregnancy, MUA is likely the more appropriate choice due to its high success rate and low complication rate at this gestational age.

Volume: 30 cc of fluid
Pleural fluid protein: 5.8 g/dL
Serum protein ratio: 7.0 g/dL
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 258 U/L

Which of the following conditions may have led to the findings in this patient’s pleural cavity?",D,"The patient's pleural fluid analysis shows a high protein level (5.8 g/dL) and an elevated LDH level (258 U/L). These findings are more consistent with an exudative pleural effusion, which is typically seen in conditions that cause inflammation or malignancy in the pleural space. Among the options given, lymphoma (Option D) is a possible cause of an exudative pleural effusion.

Here's a brief explanation of the other options:

A. Congestive heart failure can cause pleural effusions, but they are usually transudative, with lower protein levels and lower LDH levels compared to the patient's results.

B. Hypoalbuminemia and C. Liver cirrhosis can also lead to pleural effusions, but these are typically transudative as well, with low protein and low LDH levels.

E. Nephrotic syndrome can cause pleural effusions, but these are also usually transudative, with low protein and low LDH levels.

The high protein and LDH levels in the patient's pleural fluid suggest an exudative effusion, which can be caused by conditions like infection, malignancy (such as lymphoma), or autoimmune disorders.

Which of the following tests is most likely to elucidate the cause of this patient's pregnancy losses?",C,"The most likely test to elucidate the cause of this patient's recurrent pregnancy losses is:

A. Anti-cardiolipin antibodies

Recurrent pregnancy loss can be caused by a variety of factors, including immunological issues, such as the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies like anti-cardiolipin antibodies. These antibodies are associated with the antiphospholipid syndrome, which can lead to recurrent miscarriages, among other complications. Given the patient's history of four consecutive losses in the second trimester, testing for anti-cardiolipin antibodies is a reasonable step in the evaluation process.

The other options are also relevant in the evaluation of recurrent pregnancy loss but are less likely to be the primary cause in this case:

B. Karotyping can identify chromosomal abnormalities in the parents, which could contribute to recurrent miscarriages, but it is not as directly associated with the patient's history of second-trimester losses.

C. Hysterosalpingogram is an imaging test to evaluate the shape of the uterus and the patency of the fallopian tubes, which can be relevant in recurrent pregnancy loss, but it is not the most likely to explain second-trimester losses.

D. Prolactin level is typically checked for conditions like hyperprolactinemia, which can affect fertility but is less commonly associated with recurrent pregnancy loss.

What characteristic of fexodenadine allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine?",D,"The characteristic of fexofenadine that allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine is D. Relative lipophobicity.

Fexofenadine is a second-generation antihistamine that is less sedating than first-generation antihistamines like diphenhydramine because it is less able to cross the blood-brain barrier due to its relative lipophobicity (i.e., it is less lipid-soluble). This means that it does not readily enter the central nervous system, where it could cause sedation.

B. Ligation

Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is considered the preferred method for primary prophylaxis in patients with high-risk varices (such as those with red wale signs or red spots) due to its efficacy and safety profile. Sclerotherapy (option A) is less favored due to a higher complication rate. Beta-blockers such as propranolol or nadolol (options C and D) are used for primary prophylaxis in patients with medium to large varices without red wale signs, and their use should be considered in conjunction with or after endoscopic therapy.

The patient seemed confused so the wife brought him in promptly, and states it has only been ten minutes since the patient was found down in the fields. Physical exam is deferred due to a confused and combative patient who is speaking clearly yet his sentences do not make any sense. The patients clothes are removed in the ED. Vital signs are currently being obtained. Which of the following is the best initial step in management?",D,"Given the patient's symptoms of drooling, excessive tearing, and confusion, as well as the context of being found collapsed on a pile of freshly picked beets, it is important to consider the possibility of organophosphate poisoning. Organophosphates are commonly used as pesticides and can be found on farms, including beet farms. The symptoms the patient is experiencing are consistent with cholinergic excess, which is typical of organophosphate poisoning.

The best initial step in management for suspected organophosphate poisoning is to administer atropine, which is an anticholinergic agent that can help to reverse the effects of the cholinergic excess. Atropine works by blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, thus alleviating symptoms such as drooling and tearing.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A. Sublingual atropine drops

However, it is important to note that the management of organophosphate poisoning typically involves a combination of atropine to manage the muscarinic symptoms, and a cholinesterase reactivator such as pralidoxime (option D) to address the nicotinic symptoms and improve the patient's condition. But, the initial step should be the administration of atropine to manage the immediate life-threatening symptoms.

In addition, if the patient is combative and unable to be safely managed, intubation (option E) may be necessary to protect the airway. But based on the given options and the immediate need to address the cholinergic excess, atropine is the best initial step.",Success

Flow cytometry on the peripheral blood reveals an absolute lymphocyte count of 50,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is A. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The patient's age, the presence of an elevated leukocyte count (58,000/mm3), and the finding of an absolute lymphocyte count of 50,000/mm3 on flow cytometry are all consistent with CLL. This is a type of cancer that starts from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) in the bone marrow and eventually moves into the blood and other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes and spleen. The patient's history of knee osteoarthritis, occasional acetaminophen use, and healthy lifestyle habits do not directly contribute to the diagnosis but are important to note for overall health management. The other options listed (MBL, MGUS, MM, PV) do not fit the laboratory findings as closely as CLL does.",Success
A 60-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of cough productive of yellow sputum with occasional streaks of blood. He has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. He is afebrile. Pulmonary examination shows inspiratory crackles at the left infraclavicular area. An x-ray of his chest shows a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning. A sputum sample does not grow acid-fast bacteria despite multiple cultures. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?,D,"The most likely cause of this patient's condition is E. Abscess formation. The presence of a radiopaque mass that shifts upon repositioning, along with the history of pulmonary tuberculosis and the clinical presentation of cough with yellow sputum and occasional streaks of blood, are consistent with an abscess. The negative cultures for acid-fast bacteria suggest that the current infection is not due to active tuberculosis, but could be a secondary bacterial infection leading to an abscess.",Success
"An 11-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother after she observed jerking movements of his arms and legs for about 30 seconds earlier that morning. He has not had fever, cough, or a runny nose. He has been healthy, except for occasional eczema. He was delivered at home in Romania. His mother had no prenatal care. She reports that he has required more time to reach developmental milestones compared to his older brother. The patient's immunization records are not available. He takes no medications. He appears pale with blue eyes and has a musty odor. He has poor eye contact. Which of the following would have most likely prevented the patient's symptoms?",B,"The symptoms described, including the musty odor and poor eye contact, along with the developmental delays, suggest a diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which leads to the accumulation of phenylalanine in the blood and brain. This accumulation can cause brain damage, leading to symptoms such as those described.

The most effective way to prevent the symptoms of PKU is through dietary restriction of phenylalanine, starting as early as possible in life. This typically involves a low-protein diet and the use of special formulas and foods that are low in phenylalanine. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine

This dietary management needs to be started early in life, ideally within the first few weeks after birth, to prevent the neurological damage that can result from high levels of phenylalanine. Early and consistent dietary control can lead to normal intellectual development and prevent the onset of symptoms.",Success
A researcher hypothesizes that low birth weight is related to obesity later in life. He conducts a study with a 95% confidence interval with a p-value of 0.049 to disprove his null hypothesis. He rejects his null hypothesis and concludes that low birth weight is associated with obesity. Which of the following statements best associates with his study?,B,"The researcher's study resulted in a p-value of 0.049, which is below the conventional threshold of 0.05 for statistical significance. This allowed him to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that low birth weight is associated with obesity later in life. However, rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true is a type 1 error. In this case, we cannot conclusively say that a type 1 error has been made because we do not have enough information to determine the truth of the null hypothesis. However, the possibility of a type 1 error is inherent in the process of hypothesis testing when the null hypothesis is rejected.

The confidence interval of 95% is not directly related to the decision to reject the null hypothesis, but it does provide a range within which the true effect is likely to fall with 95% confidence. Changing the confidence interval to 90% would not have changed the p-value or the decision to reject the null hypothesis, but it would have resulted in a narrower confidence interval.

A type 2 error, which occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is actually false, is not relevant in this case because the null hypothesis was rejected. Therefore, options A, B, C, and D are incorrect.

The statement that best associates with his study is:

E. A type 1 error has been made.

However, this is not to say that a type 1 error has definitely been made, only that the possibility exists because the null hypothesis was rejected. The correct interpretation is that the researcher has found evidence that supports the association between low birth weight and obesity, but there is always a small chance that this conclusion is due to random variation rather than a true effect.",Success
"A 52-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for abdominal pain and diarrhea. The patient states that she has been experiencing watery diarrhea for weeks now. During this same period she states she has been constantly thirsty and does not have the same energy levels that she once had. The patient has a past medical history of anxiety and depression and is currently taking fluoxetine. She was recently treated for a middle ear infection and sinusitis with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid one week ago. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 110/58 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

Which of the following is associated with the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), which is associated with the destruction of normal gut flora (Option E). The patient's recent use of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, can disrupt the normal gut microbiota, allowing overgrowth of C. difficile, a spore-forming anaerobic bacterium. The symptoms of watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and the recent antibiotic use are all indicative of CDI. The low potassium level (hypokalemia) can also be a result of severe diarrhea. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation as well as the destruction of normal flora.",Success
"A 3-week-old newborn is brought to the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but the patient often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",E,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is Hirschsprung disease, which is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, leading to functional obstruction. The explosive release of stool following a rectal exam and the x-ray findings of a dilated colon followed by a segment without stool or air are consistent with this diagnosis. The best test to confirm the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease is a rectal suction biopsy (Option E), which allows for histological examination of the rectal mucosa to identify the absence of ganglion cells.",Success
"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive left leg pain for 2 months, which has started to interfere with his sleep. His mother has been giving him ibuprofen at night for “growing pains,” but his symptoms have not improved. One week before the pain started, the patient was hit in the thigh by a baseball, which caused his leg to become red and swollen for several days. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. His gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. A biopsy of the left femur shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is D. Ewing sarcoma. The patient's history of progressive left leg pain, which has not improved with ibuprofen, along with the physical examination findings of marked tenderness along the left mid-femur and the laboratory findings of an elevated leukocyte count and ESR, suggest an inflammatory or neoplastic process. The x-ray findings of multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, with surrounding new bone formation, and the biopsy finding of small round blue cells are characteristic of Ewing sarcoma. Osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteochondroma, and osteoid osteoma are less likely based on the patient's presentation and the imaging and biopsy findings.",Success

"A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with severe, crushing, retrosternal chest pain for the last 45 minutes. The pain radiates to his left shoulder and is associated with sweating. The past medical history is significant for hypercholesterolemia, for which he takes lovastatin. He smoked as a youth but quit at 40 years of age. On arrival at the emergency department, the vital signs were as follows: pulse 58/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and blood pressure 90/56 mm Hg. He is sweating profusely. The jugular venous pulse is visible 2.5 cm above the sternal angle. Auscultation reveals soft S1 and S2 heart sounds with an added S4 and bilateral inspiratory crackles at the lung bases. The electrocardiogram shows ST-elevations in leads V1 and V2.

C. Persistent ST-segment elevation

Persistent ST-segment elevation after thrombolytic therapy (streptokinase in this case) may indicate that the thrombolytic therapy has not been successful in restoring blood flow to the affected area of the heart. This could signify ongoing ischemia or an ongoing myocardial infarction, which is a critical situation that requires immediate attention and potentially further intervention, such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Persistent ST-segment elevation is an indication for urgent coronary angiography.

The physician decides to start the patient on an additional medication that has both mucoactive and anti-oxidative properties. What is the primary mechanism of action of this medication in the lungs?",B,"The medication that has both mucoactive and anti-oxidative properties and is likely to be prescribed for this patient is most likely to have its primary mechanism of action through disulfide bond cleavage (Option B). This type of medication, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC), works by breaking disulfide bonds in the mucus, thereby reducing its viscosity and making it easier to clear from the airways. This can help improve symptoms in conditions like chronic bronchitis and COPD, which are characterized by excessive mucus production and difficulty in mucus clearance. Additionally, NAC has anti-oxidative properties that can help protect lung tissue from oxidative stress, which is common in smokers and patients with chronic lung diseases.",Success

Pco2 70 mm Hg
HCO3-  26 mEq/L
Which of the following could explain this patient's presentation?",E,"The patient's presentation, including her unconsciousness, shallow breathing, constricted pupils, and the arterial blood gas results, are most consistent with an opioid overdose (Option E). Opioids can cause respiratory depression, which would explain the low respiratory rate and the high Pco2 level, indicating hypoventilation. The pH is slightly decreased, indicating respiratory acidosis, which is also consistent with hypoventilation. The constricted pupils are a classic sign of opioid intoxication. The other options do not fit the patient's presentation as well:

A. COPD exacerbation would not typically cause constricted pupils and would not result in the degree of respiratory depression seen here.

B. Diabetic ketoacidosis would present with deep, rapid breathing (Kussmaul respirations), not shallow breathing, and would show a lower pH and lower HCO3- levels on the blood gas.

What is the best first step in the management of this patient’s symptoms?,E,"D. Refer to ophthalmologist

The patient's symptoms of vision impairment and difficulty with night driving suggest a possible ophthalmologic issue. Given that his vision has been deteriorating over the last 6 months, it is important to rule out any potential eye diseases or conditions that could be causing his symptoms. While his antipsychotic medication could potentially have ocular side effects, the best first step is to refer him to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye examination. This specialist can evaluate his visual acuity, check for any retinal or corneal issues, and assess for conditions such as cataracts, glaucoma, or diabetic retinopathy, which can affect vision and night driving ability. Once the ophthalmologist has evaluated the patient, they can provide a diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment, which may or may not involve changes to his medication regimen.",Success

However, given the symptoms and the context, we can make an educated guess based on the options provided.

A. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy typically presents with symptoms such as dyspnea, syncope, or chest pain, especially during exertion. It's less likely to present with dizziness and palpitations in a previously healthy individual after a night of drinking.

B. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation can present with palpitations and dizziness. This is a common arrhythmia that can be triggered by alcohol consumption, making it a plausible diagnosis.

C. Brugada syndrome is a genetic condition that can cause sudden cardiac arrest. It can present with syncope or nocturnal agonal respiration, but it's less common and less likely to be triggered by alcohol consumption alone.

D. Ventricular tachycardia can cause palpitations, dizziness, and can be life-threatening. However, it's less likely to be triggered by alcohol consumption alone in a previously healthy individual.

E. Sick sinus syndrome typically presents in older individuals and is characterized by bradycardia, not tachycardia. It's less likely to be triggered by a night of drinking.

Further evaluation of this patient will most likely show which of the following?",E,"The symptoms described, including diarrhea, weight loss, heart palpitations, and facial flushing, along with the laboratory finding of increased urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentration, are most consistent with a diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is typically caused by a carcinoid tumor, which is a type of neuroendocrine tumor that can secrete various substances, including serotonin (which is broken down into 5-HIAA). Serotonin can cause the symptoms described.

Among the options given, none directly point to carcinoid syndrome. However, the option that is most closely related to the pathophysiology of carcinoid syndrome is:

D. Multiple peptic ulcers

While peptic ulcers are not a direct manifestation of carcinoid syndrome, they can be associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, which is another type of neuroendocrine tumor that can co-occur with carcinoid tumors or be part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is characterized by the overproduction of gastrin, leading to peptic ulcers. However, it's important to note that the presence of multiple peptic ulcers is not specific to carcinoid syndrome and could be due to other causes.

The other options are less likely to be associated with the symptoms and laboratory findings:

A. Proximal muscle wasting is not typically associated with carcinoid syndrome.
B. Achlorhydria (lack of stomach acid) is not a feature of carcinoid syndrome; in fact, carcinoid tumors can sometimes be associated with increased gastric acid secretion.
C. An adrenal medullary mass would suggest pheochromocytoma, which can cause hypertension and palpitations but is not typically associated with diarrhea or the other symptoms described.

Which of the following should be added to this patient's treatment regimen?",D,"The patient presents with signs and symptoms of an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with a productive cough, increased sputum production that is yellow-green, shortness of breath, and a fever. These findings suggest a bacterial infection, which is common in exacerbations of COPD. The choice of antibiotic should be guided by the patient's history, local antibiotic resistance patterns, and the severity of the exacerbation.

Given the patient's history of multiple hospitalizations for similar symptoms, it is likely that he has been exposed to hospital-acquired pathogens, which may have different resistance patterns compared to community-acquired bacteria. Therefore, it is important to choose an antibiotic that covers potential hospital-acquired pathogens.

Options A, B, and E (Amoxicillin, Cefazolin, and Penicillin) are typically used for community-acquired infections and may not be effective against hospital-acquired pathogens. Ceftriaxone (Option C) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that could be used, but it is often reserved for more severe infections or when there is a high suspicion of certain resistant bacteria.

Levofloxacin (Option D) is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has good coverage for both community-acquired and hospital-acquired pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative rods, which are common in exacerbations of COPD in patients with a history of hospitalization. It is also effective against atypical bacteria like Mycoplasma and Legionella. Fluoroquinolones are often recommended for patients with severe exacerbations of COPD or those who have been hospitalized in the past year due to their broader spectrum of activity.

Which of the following would most likely confirm the diagnosis in this patient?",E,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a systemic inflammatory process, with involvement of the respiratory system, nasal mucosa, and possibly the kidneys, given the elevated creatinine level. The presence of nasal ulcers, diffuse crackles in the lungs, and the lack of response to corticosteroid nasal spray and oral antibiotics, along with the high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, point towards an autoimmune or vasculitic process.

Among the options provided, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are most likely to confirm the diagnosis in this patient. ANCA are associated with a group of disorders known as ANCA-associated vasculitides, which include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's), microscopic polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome).

C. Exophthalmos

Exophthalmos, or protrusion of the eyeballs, is a common manifestation of Graves' disease due to inflammation and increased tissue volume in the orbit. This can lead to a characteristic ""staring"" appearance and may be accompanied by other eye symptoms such as redness, swelling, and double vision.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's disease:

A. Sympathetic underactivity - This would be more consistent with hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism.
B. Anti-thyroglobin antibodies - These are not typically associated with Graves' disease but may be present in other thyroid disorders.
D. Increased TSH release - In Graves' disease, the TSH levels are typically suppressed due to the negative feedback effect of high levels of T4 and T3 on the pituitary gland.
E. Multinucleate giant cells present in the thyroid - This is more characteristic of Hashimoto's thyroiditis or subacute thyroiditis, not Graves' disease.",Success
"A 3-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for delayed passage of meconium. His mother is breastfeeding and has started to produce milk. The patient has been feeding well every two hours and is urinating over eight times per day. The patient was born at 35 weeks gestation to a 27-year-old gravida 4. The patient is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and the patient’s parents denied all prenatal genetic testing. The pregnancy was uncomplicated until the patient’s mother had spontaneous rupture of membranes at 35 weeks gestation. The patient’s three older siblings are all healthy. In the hospital nursery, the patient’s temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 48/32 mmHg, pulse is 164/min, and respirations are 48/min. On physical exam, he appears to be in moderate distress. He has no dysmorphic features, and his abdomen is distended and non-tender. Bowel sounds are absent.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The best next step in management for this patient with delayed passage of meconium and a distended, non-tender abdomen with absent bowel sounds is:

C. Contrast enema

A contrast enema can help diagnose conditions such as Hirschsprung disease, which is characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the nerve plexus of the distal colon, leading to intestinal obstruction. This condition is more common in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and can present with delayed passage of meconium in newborns. The contrast enema can show a transition zone between the dilated proximal colon and the narrowed distal colon, which is a hallmark of Hirschsprung disease.

Abdominal CT (Option A) and abdominal radiograph (Option B) may also be useful in evaluating the abdominal distention, but contrast enema is more specific for diagnosing Hirschsprung disease. An upper gastrointestinal series (Option D) would not be as helpful in evaluating the colon. Sweat testing (Option E) is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, which is not suggested by the patient's presentation.",Success
"A 78-year-old woman presents to the office for an annual health check-up with her family physician accompanied by her daughter. She has no complaints during this visit but her daughter states that she is having difficulty locating objects such as the television remote, car keys, and her purse. Her medical history is significant for Alzheimer’s dementia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis and centrilobular emphysema. The patient takes memantine, atorvastatin, metformin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, aspirin, albuterol, and ipratropium. The patient’s vitals are within normal limits today. Physical exam reveals an elderly female in no acute distress, oriented to person, place and year, but not to month or day of the week. She has a 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border along with an S3 gallop. There are mild crackles at the lung bases. The remainder of the exam is normal. A previous urine culture reports growth of > 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter. Urinalysis findings are offered below:
Leukocyte esterase  positive
WBCs 50-100 cell/HPF
Nitrites positive
RBCs 2 cell/HPF
Epithelial cells 2 cell/HPF
Urine pH 5.7
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",E,"Based on the patient's history and the urinalysis findings, which indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI) with positive leukocyte esterase, high white blood cells (WBCs), and positive nitrites, treatment for a UTI is indicated. The choice of antibiotic should take into account the patient's age, comorbidities, and the known pathogen Enterobacter.

Enterobacter species are often resistant to multiple antibiotics, including some commonly used for UTIs. TMP-SMX (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and nitrofurantoin are often used for uncomplicated UTIs, but Enterobacter can be resistant to these agents. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that is often effective against Enterobacter species, but there are concerns about its use in elderly patients due to potential side effects such as tendon rupture, especially in those with comorbidities like diabetes and heart failure. Cephalexin is a first-generation cephalosporin that is not typically recommended for UTIs caused by Enterobacter due to potential resistance.

Given the patient's comorbidities and the need for an effective antibiotic against Enterobacter, the most appropriate next step would be to choose an antibiotic with good coverage for Enterobacter that also takes into account the patient's safety. Among the options provided, levofloxacin (option C) might be the most appropriate choice if the patient has no contraindications to its use, such as a history of tendon issues or a QTc prolongation. However, the decision should be made after considering the local antibiotic resistance patterns and the patient's specific risk factors.

It is important to note that if the patient has a history of or risk factors for fluoroquinolone-associated adverse events, or if Enterobacter is known to be resistant to levofloxacin in the local setting, an alternative antibiotic should be chosen. In such cases, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin or an aminoglycoside might be considered, although these are not listed among the options provided. A culture and sensitivity test should also be performed to guide antibiotic selection if not already done.",Success
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of painful ulcers in her mouth. Over the past 2 months, she has had increasing fatigue and difficulties concentrating. She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and was started on a new medication 4 months ago. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes and three tender ulcerative lesions in her mouth. Her hemoglobin concentration is 8.7 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume is 109 μm3. A blood smear shows hypersegmented neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?",D,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are most consistent with megaloblastic anemia, which is characterized by a low hemoglobin concentration, an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and the presence of hypersegmented neutrophils on a blood smear. Megaloblastic anemia can be caused by deficiencies in either vitamin B12 or folic acid, both of which are required for DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells such as those in the bone marrow. The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and the recent initiation of a new medication suggest that the anemia may be drug-induced. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's findings is deficient DNA synthesis due to a deficiency in either vitamin B12 or folic acid (Option B, deficient DNA crosslink repair, is not correct because DNA crosslink repair is not involved in the pathogenesis of megaloblastic anemia). Options A, C, D, and E are not correct because they do not explain the patient's findings of megaloblastic anemia.",Success

She says that her symptoms began 4 days ago as a painful mass that slowly enlarged, ruptured, and ulcerated. However, she denies fever, chills, dysuria, or hematuria. Three weeks prior to her current symptoms she noted a small, painless ulcer on her labium majorum that resolved after a few days. She admits to having unprotected sex with a male partner a month ago while she was traveling in Southeast Asia. Temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 139/84 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination is significant for left-sided, tender, ulcerative lymph nodes with a dark discoloration. Which of the following is most likely to be seen in this patient's condition?",C,"The patient's history and physical examination findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of granuloma inguinale, also known as donovanosis. This sexually transmitted infection is caused by the bacterium Klebsiella granulomatis (formerly Calymmatobacterium granulomatis) and is characterized by painless, slowly enlarging, ulcerative lesions in the genital area that may eventually rupture and bleed. The presence of painful, ulcerative lymph nodes with a dark discoloration in the left groin, along with a history of a painless ulcer on the labium majorum that resolved, and recent unprotected sexual activity in Southeast Asia, where granuloma inguinale is endemic, are all highly suggestive of this diagnosis.

Donovan bodies, which are characteristic intracellular inclusions seen in macrophages infected with K. granulomatis, can be identified on Wright-Giemsa stain of a smear from the ulcer base. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient's condition is:

A. Donovan bodies on Wright-Giemsa stain

The other options are less likely:

B. Gram-negative rods in school of fish formation on Gram stain: This description is characteristic of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhea. However, the clinical presentation does not match that of gonorrhea.

C. PCR positive for Chlamydia trachomatis: Chlamydia infection can cause lymphogranuloma venereum, which can present with inguinal lymphadenopathy, but the ulcerative nature of the lesions and the dark discoloration are not typical.

D. Positive RPR, VDRL, and FTA-ABS: These tests are used to diagnose syphilis. While syphilis can present with genital ulcers and inguinal lymphadenopathy, the ulcerative lymph nodes with dark discoloration and the patient's history of a painless genital ulcer that resolved are more consistent with granuloma inguinale.

E. Tzanck smear with multinucleated giant cells: This finding is characteristic of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, which can cause painful genital ulcers. However, the painless nature of the initial ulcer and the subsequent ulcerative lymph nodes with dark discoloration do not match the typical presentation of HSV.",Success
"A 70-year-old hypertensive and hyperlipidemic woman comes to the emergency department with chief complaints of acute onset of impaired speech and comprehension with a right-sided weakness for the last 1.5 hours. The patient was on 2 antihypertensive medications and a statin, but she was not receiving any antiplatelet drugs. She has a blood pressure of 136/94, heart rate of 84/min, and respiratory rate of 15/min. Initial examination shows global aphasia, right homonymous hemianopia, and hemisensory loss. An acute ischemic stroke caused by distal left internal carotid artery occlusion with salvageable penumbral tissue is diagnosed based on a non-contrast CT scan, brain MRI, and catheter cerebral angiogram. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is given as treatment within 3 hours of presentation. Which of the following cellular processes is typical of the section of reversible injury noted in this patient?",E,"The section of reversible injury noted in this patient, which is referred to as the penumbra, is characterized by a decrease in ATP (Option E). In the context of an acute ischemic stroke, the penumbra is the area surrounding the core of the infarct where the tissue is not yet irreversibly damaged but is at high risk of transitioning to necrosis if blood flow is not restored. The primary cellular process in this region is a decrease in ATP production due to reduced oxygen and glucose supply, leading to impaired cellular function and viability. This decrease in ATP can lead to secondary processes such as mitochondrial dysfunction, ionic imbalances, and eventually, if not reversed, to the other processes listed (A-D), which are associated with irreversible cell damage and cell death. However, the most typical process in the penumbra is the decrease in ATP, making Option E the correct answer.",Success
"During the normal catabolism of protein, urea and ammonia are produced as waste products. If these waste products are not cleared by the liver and kidneys, hyperammonemia can occur, leading to confusion and delirium. Fortunately, a healthy liver can clear these waste products via the urea cycle. Which of the following reactions is the rate limiting step in this cycle?",A,"The rate-limiting step in the urea cycle is the first reaction, which is catalyzed by the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPS I). This reaction is:

A. NH3 + HCO3- + 2 ATP --> carbamoyl phosphate + 2 ADP + Pi

This step is crucial because it is the first step in the cycle and it requires the consumption of two ATP molecules, making it energetically demanding. The enzyme CPS I is also regulated by several factors, including N-acetylglutamate, which is an activator, and citrulline and arginine, which are inhibitors. This regulation ensures that the urea cycle operates at a rate that matches the body's need for ammonia detoxification.",Success
"A 46-year-old man presents with worsening pain in multiple joints for the past 2 weeks. He says the pain is most severe in the proximal parts of his fingers and his wrists, but it has now spread to his elbows, and, occasionally, his knees. He says the joint involvement is symmetric. He also complains of morning joint stiffness that improves with activity and reports feeling fatigued during the day. He started taking ibuprofen 2 months ago for the pain which initially subsided, but, over the last few weeks, it has worsened despite the medication. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 1 year ago and has had difficulty controlling his blood glucose levels. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol, or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a weight loss of 3.0 kg (6.6 lb) over the last 3 months despite no change in diet or activity level. Which of the following is the most likely 1st-line medication in this patient?",D,"The most likely 1st-line medication for this patient's condition, which appears to be consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), is D. Methotrexate. Methotrexate is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that is often used as a first-line treatment for RA due to its efficacy and relatively favorable side effect profile compared to other options. It is important to note that the patient's symptoms of symmetric joint pain, stiffness, and recent weight loss, along with the lack of improvement with ibuprofen, suggest an inflammatory arthritis such as RA, which requires more aggressive treatment than nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alone.

Options A, B, and C are all medications used in the treatment of RA, but they are typically reserved for patients who have failed to respond to methotrexate or other DMARDs. Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant used in severe cases of RA, infliximab is a biologic DMARD that targets TNF-alpha, and anakinra is a biologic that blocks IL-1. High-dose prednisone (option E) can be used for short-term control of severe inflammation but is not typically a first-line long-term treatment due to the risk of side effects.",Success

"A 2-year-old girl is brought in to the office by her parents. They state that their daughter has recently been more irritable than usual, and she occasionally becomes pale and blue. Her parents note that she was diagnosed with a heart murmur, but it was never treated. Physical examination reveals a small child in distress. She is laying on the examination table with her knees drawn to her chest. Cardiac auscultation reveals a harsh, systolic ejection murmur that is best heard at the upper left sternal border.

Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect that includes four abnormalities: a ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. The combination of these defects leads to cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes due to poor oxygenation) and can cause episodes of ""tet spells"" where the child becomes very pale or blue and may also experience irritability or distress. The child's position with knees drawn to her chest may be an attempt to increase oxygenation and reduce symptoms.

Which of the following statements best describes this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct statement that best describes this patient’s condition is:

A. This patient's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is more than 5.

The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is a measure of the severity of sleep apnea and is calculated by dividing the total number of apneas and hypopneas during sleep by the total sleep time in hours. An AHI of 5 or more is considered abnormal and indicative of sleep apnea. In this case, the patient had 12 episodes of apnea and 30 episodes of hypopnea during a 7-hour sleep, resulting in an AHI of approximately 6, which is above the threshold for sleep apnea.

B. While it is true that episodes of apnea and hypopnea can occur during deeper stages of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, this statement does not specifically address the patient's condition as described.

C. Mouth opening during sleep does not necessarily relieve airway obstruction; in fact, it can contribute to it by allowing the tongue to fall back into the throat and block the airway.

D. The base of the tongue is indeed a common site of airway collapse during sleep apnea, but this statement does not directly address the patient's condition as described.

E. While obesity is a risk factor for sleep apnea, the distribution of body fat (gynoid vs. android) is not necessarily a determining factor for the presence of apnea and hypopnea. Both gynoid and android obesity can be associated with sleep apnea.",Success

Which of the following most likely accounts for the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient?",D,"The increased expiratory flow rate in this patient, despite his symptoms of cough and shortness of breath, is most likely due to D. Radial traction on airway wall. This scenario is consistent with a diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD), which is suggested by the bilateral basilar fine crackles on pulmonary auscultation and the presence of digital clubbing. In ILD, the lung parenchyma is affected, leading to fibrosis and stiffening of the lung tissue. This results in decreased lung compliance but can paradoxically increase expiratory flow rates due to the radial traction on the airway walls, keeping them open during expiration. This is because the stiff lung tissue acts to hold the airways open during expiration, preventing their collapse. The chest X-ray would likely show reticular or honeycombing patterns consistent with ILD.",Success

However, it typically occurs during or immediately after anesthesia, not hours later, and is associated with other symptoms such as muscle rigidity.

D. Urinary tract infection: Although this could cause fever and chills, the presence of a Foley catheter does not necessarily mean a UTI is the cause, especially without other symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, or frequency.

Complete blood count and serum levels of glucose, bilirubin, and calcium are within normal limits. What is the most appropriate next step in treatment of this newborn?",A,"The symptoms presented by the newborn, including poor feeding, high-pitched cry, diaphoresis, hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response, along with the mother's history of codeine use, are indicative of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS occurs when a newborn experiences withdrawal symptoms after being exposed to addictive substances in the womb. In this case, the substance is codeine, which is an opioid.

The appropriate treatment for NAS is aimed at managing the symptoms and providing supportive care. Among the options provided, oral morphine therapy (Option A) is the most appropriate next step in treatment. Morphine is an opioid that can help manage the withdrawal symptoms by binding to the same receptors as codeine but with a longer duration of action, providing relief from the symptoms of withdrawal. The goal of treatment is to taper the newborn off the morphine gradually as the symptoms resolve.

Options B, C, D, and E are not appropriate for the treatment of NAS in this context:

B. Oral clonidine therapy: Clonidine is an alpha-2 agonist used to treat hypertension and sometimes for opioid withdrawal in adults, but it is not a first-line treatment for neonatal abstinence syndrome.

C. Intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin combination therapy: This is an antibiotic treatment, which is not indicated for the symptoms presented by the newborn. There is no evidence of infection based on the information provided.

D. Oral methimazole therapy: Methimazole is used to treat hyperthyroidism. There is no indication that the newborn has a thyroid disorder.

E. Dextrose infusion: While hypoglycemia can be a concern in newborns, especially those with NAS, the infant's glucose level is within normal limits, making this option unnecessary based on the information provided.

C. Anti-hemidesmosome titers are associated with pemphigus vulgaris and other blistering diseases but are not specific to SLE.

D. Urine porphyrin levels are relevant for diagnosing porphyria, a group of disorders that can cause skin blistering but are not typically associated with SLE.

E. A Tzanck smear is a test used to diagnose viral infections or pemphigus by examining cells from a blister, but it would not specifically confirm an exacerbation of SLE.

Which of the following cellular organelles is significant in the formation of these cells?",C,"The cellular organelle significant in the formation of heart failure cells (hemosiderin-containing macrophages) is:

C. Lysosomes

Lysosomes are responsible for breaking down and recycling cellular waste, including the breakdown of hemoglobin from red blood cells. In cases of congestive heart failure, the lungs can become congested with blood, leading to red blood cell leakage and hemoglobin breakdown in the alveoli. Lysosomes in macrophages then digest the hemoglobin, and the iron is stored as hemosiderin, giving the cells their characteristic appearance under a microscope.",Success
"A previously healthy 52-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after sustaining burns over 45% of her body in a house fire. On arrival, she is in acute distress but is fully oriented. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun and the patient is transferred to the intensive care unit of a burn center. 20 hours later, she has several large, tarry black stools and develops hypotension and tachycardia. Despite appropriate lifesaving measures, she dies. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools?",D,"The most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools in this scenario is option D: Decreased gastric blood flow. This condition can lead to stress ulcers or acute gastric mucosal lesions (AGML), which are common in critically ill patients, particularly those with severe burns. The stress of the injury and the inflammatory response can lead to decreased blood flow to the stomach lining, causing mucosal damage and bleeding. This bleeding can manifest as tarry black stools, known as melena.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care provider after feeling sad and depressed for the past several months. His wife divorced him about 6 months ago and took the kids and moved out of state. Since then he has had difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time. He takes some comfort in food and has gained about 9.1 kg (20 lb). He eats out several times a week and sometimes consumes 2 whole meals in one sitting. Other than this new obsession with eating large quantities of food and excess sleeping he no longer enjoys doing things he liked doing in the past. Besides eating and sleeping he is always excited to see his children and looks forward to their visits. He says it's the one thing keeping him going. Additionally, he does not feel like he has the same drive or focuses at work. He reports that he has no interest in hurting himself or others. His blood pressure is 119/81 mm Hg, pulse rate is 85/min, respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). His physical exam is normal. What other symptom is most likely present in this patient?",A,"Based on the information provided, the patient is most likely experiencing depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning (Option B). The patient has been feeling sad and depressed for several months, has difficulty waking up in the morning, and has lost interest in activities he used to enjoy. These symptoms are indicative of major depressive disorder, and morning worsening of depressive symptoms is a common feature of this condition.

The other options do not seem to be supported by the information given:
A. Leaden paralysis refers to a symptom of severe depression where the patient feels as if their limbs are weighted down, making movement difficult. There is no mention of this symptom in the patient's presentation.
C. Psychotic features, such as hallucinations or delusions, are not mentioned in the patient's history.

"A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with acute shortness of breath that developed after a 10-hour international flight. His pulse is 124/min and pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 90%. He weighs 50-kg (110-lb). A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is suspected and intravenous heparin is initiated. If the volume of distribution of heparin is equivalent to 60 mL/kg and the target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL, which of the following is the most appropriate loading dose for this patient?",B,"To calculate the loading dose for heparin, we need to consider the volume of distribution and the target peak plasma concentration. The volume of distribution for heparin is given as 60 mL/kg, and the patient weighs 50 kg. Therefore, the total volume of distribution for this patient is:

60 mL/kg * 50 kg = 3000 mL

The target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL. To achieve this concentration, the total amount of heparin required in the patient's volume of distribution is:

0.5 units/mL * 3000 mL = 1500 units

Therefore, the most appropriate loading dose for this patient is 1500 units of heparin.

Answer: B. 1,500 units",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to a surgeon with painless swelling over his right leg. He noticed the swelling 6 months ago, but he ignored it because it was painless. However, he is now concerned as the swelling has been increasing in size over the last 6 months. He also mentions that his father and brother have lipomas over the extremities. On physical examination, the swelling is well-circumscribed and non-tender, measuring approximately 4 x 5 cm. After evaluation, the surgeon performs a surgical resection of the tumor and sends the tissue for histopathological examination. The pathologist reports the tumor to be a liposarcoma rather than a lipoma. Which of the following enzymes is most likely to show increased activity in the cells of this patient’s tumor?",E,"The correct answer is E. Telomerase.

Telomerase is an enzyme that is typically active in stem cells and cancer cells. It is responsible for maintaining the length of telomeres, which are the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. In most normal cells, telomerase activity is low, and telomeres shorten with each cell division, eventually leading to cell senescence or death. However, in cancer cells, including liposarcoma cells, telomerase activity is often increased, allowing the cells to divide indefinitely and potentially leading to tumor growth.

The other enzymes listed (alkaline phosphatase, DNase, RNase, and superoxide dismutase) do not have a direct role in the pathogenesis of liposarcoma or in the increased cell proliferation that characterizes cancer. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme that is often elevated in conditions such as bone disease or liver disease, but it is not a marker for liposarcoma. DNase and RNase are enzymes that break down DNA and RNA, respectively, and are not typically associated with cancer. Superoxide dismutase is an enzyme that helps to neutralize superoxide radicals and is involved in the cell's antioxidant defense system, but it is not a marker for increased cell proliferation in cancer.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a wellness visit. She says that she has been generally healthy but has noticed difficulty concentrating, becoming increasingly fatigued, and a 15-pound weight increase over the course of a few months.

Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?",A,"The clinical presentation described is consistent with DiGeorge syndrome, also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. This condition is characterized by cardiac anomalies (such as a conotruncal defect where a single overriding great vessel arises from the heart), facial dysmorphisms (including micrognathia, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, and small, low-set ears), and a high incidence of cleft palate. The patient may also have immunodeficiency and endocrine abnormalities.

The specific finding that further evaluation is most likely to show among the options given is:

C. Chromosome 5p deletion on FISH studies

However, this is incorrect based on the clinical presentation. The correct finding to look for would be a deletion on chromosome 22q11.2, but since that option is not available, the closest and most relevant finding in this context would be related to cardiac anomalies or other features consistent with DiGeorge syndrome.

"An 80-year-old man presents with severe pain of the right lower extremity. He says that symptoms had an acute onset while he was in the ICU for a COPD exacerbation due to a recent upper respiratory infection, which was treated with nebulized albuterol and ipratropium bromide, continuous oxygen, IV methylprednisolone, and levofloxacin. He says he has been hospitalized 3 other times this year for COPD exacerbations. The medical history is significant for a left main coronary artery myocardial infarction after a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 2 months ago, mild cognitive impairment, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications are metformin, aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, atorvastatin, galantamine, and enalapril. He reports a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago.

The physical examination is significant for the cutaneous finding shown in the picture. The involved area is severely tender to palpation and there are warmth and crepitus. A foul-smelling discharge is also noted. Pain seems out of proportion to the exam findings. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",C,"The cutaneous finding described in the case, along with the symptoms of severe pain, warmth, crepitus, and a foul-smelling discharge, is highly suggestive of a necrotizing soft tissue infection, such as necrotizing fasciitis. This is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgical intervention and antibiotic therapy. The patient's history of recent hospitalization, COPD exacerbation, and immunomodulatory medications may have contributed to his vulnerability to such an infection.

The next best step in management is:

C. Immediate debridement and empiric IV antibiotics

This approach aims to remove the infected tissue to prevent the spread of infection and to start broad-spectrum antibiotics to combat the causative organisms. Delay in treatment can lead to rapid progression of the infection, sepsis, and potentially death. High-dose IV dexamethasone (Option A) is not indicated in this scenario as it is an immunosuppressant and could worsen the infection. A biopsy (Option D) would delay necessary treatment and is not the first-line approach.

"A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after losing consciousness at work. On presentation, she is found to be somnolent though she is able to be woken by vocal stimuli. She says that over the last 12 hours, she has been experiencing muscle spasms, blurred vision, dry mouth, and hallucinations. She says that the symptoms started after she went on a hike in the woods and foraged from plants along the way. Physical exam reveals dry red skin and enlarged pupils. Her bladder is also found to be completely full though she says she is unable to urinate. Which of the following drugs would most likely be administered to this patient to treat her symptoms?",B,"The patient's symptoms are consistent with anticholinergic toxicity, which can be caused by ingestion of certain plants, such as Jimson weed (Datura stramonium), which is commonly found in the wild. The symptoms of muscle spasms, blurred vision, dry mouth, hallucinations, dry red skin, enlarged pupils, and urinary retention are all characteristic of anticholinergic toxicity.

The treatment for anticholinergic toxicity involves the use of a cholinesterase inhibitor to counteract the effects of the anticholinergic substance. Among the options provided, Physostigmine (B) is a cholinesterase inhibitor that can be used to treat anticholinergic toxicity by increasing the levels of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, thereby reversing the effects of the anticholinergic substance.

The right humeral head is palpated below the coracoid process. Sensation to pinprick over which of the following skin areas is most likely to be reduced?,B,"The injury described is consistent with a dislocation of the shoulder, specifically an anterior dislocation. In this type of injury, the humeral head moves anteriorly and inferiorly, often resulting in compression or stretching of the axillary nerve. The axillary nerve innervates the deltoid muscle and provides sensation to the lateral aspect of the shoulder and upper arm.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

B. Lateral aspect of the shoulder

Upon review, this patient reveals that he has not had care from a physician since he graduated from college. In the interim he has been largely unemployed and admits that he has recently been homeless. When asked directly, the patient admits to alcohol and marijuana use but denies illicit drug use. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the agent most likely responsible for this patient's presentation?",A,"The patient's presentation, including chest pain, hypertension, tachycardia, anxiety, agitation, dilated pupils, and a perforated nasal septum, is consistent with the effects of stimulant drug use. The patient's denial of illicit drug use may be unreliable, given his history of substance use and lack of recent medical care. Among the options provided, the mechanism of action that best describes the agent most likely responsible for this patient's presentation is:

A. Blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine

Stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines work by blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, leading to increased levels of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. This results in enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity, which can manifest as hypertension, tachycardia, and agitation. The dilated pupils and perforated nasal septum suggest a history of cocaine use, which is often administered intranasally and can lead to nasal septum perforation over time.",Success
"A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of difficulty falling asleep for the past 2 months. She wakes up frequently during the night and gets up earlier than desired.

She has tried an over-the-counter sleep aid that contains diphenhydramine, which worsened her symptoms. She exercises regularly and eats a well-balanced diet. She admits that she has been under a lot of stress lately. Her brother has similar symptoms. The patient appears anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and iron studies are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms?",B,"The patient's symptoms are most consistent with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), which is characterized by an urge to move the legs, usually accompanied or caused by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs. These symptoms typically occur at rest or during the night and are often relieved by movement. The fact that her symptoms worsen with an antihistamine (diphenhydramine) is also suggestive of RLS, as antihistamines can exacerbate RLS symptoms.

The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for RLS is pramipexole (Option B), which is a dopamine agonist. Dopamine agonists are considered first-line treatment for moderate to severe RLS. They work by increasing the activity of dopamine in the brain, which helps to reduce the symptoms of RLS.

Amitriptyline (Option A) is a tricyclic antidepressant and is not typically used for RLS. Codeine (Option C) is an opioid and is not indicated for the treatment of RLS. Propranolol (Option D) is a beta-blocker used for hypertension and anxiety, but it is not effective for RLS. Escitalopram (Option E) is an SSRI antidepressant and is not used to treat RLS.

Decreased cardiac output. The patient's symptoms, including worsening upper abdominal pain radiating to her back, nausea, and the physical examination findings of abdominal distention with epigastric tenderness and guarding, suggest a serious abdominal condition. The hypotension (blood pressure 84/58 mm Hg) and tachycardia (pulse 115/min) are indicative of shock, which can be caused by decreased cardiac output. However, it is important to note that in the context of her symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute pancreatitis, which can lead to shock due to fluid loss and inflammation.

This symptom, in conjunction with the patient's age and the fact that the speech difficulty has been present for 3 months, suggests a possible cerebrovascular cause. The fact that the patient is fluent and has normal comprehension rules out global aphasia and points towards a more localized lesion.

The left middle cerebral artery (Option A) supplies the dominant hemisphere in a right-handed individual, which is typically the left hemisphere. This artery supplies the language areas of the brain, including Broca's area and Wernicke's area, which are crucial for speech production and comprehension, respectively. Damage to the left middle cerebral artery territory can result in various types of aphasia, including anomia.

Options B, C, and D (Right vertebral, Left posterior inferior cerebellar, and Left posterior cerebral arteries) are less likely to cause the specific language symptoms described because they primarily supply areas of the brain that are not directly involved in language processing.

Option E (Left penetrating arteries) could potentially cause the described symptoms if they affected the language centers in the left hemisphere, but the middle cerebral artery is the main supplier of these regions, making it the most likely answer.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is occlusion of a branch of the left middle cerebral artery (Option A).",Success
"An investigator is studying the frequency of polycythemia in a population of a remote, mountainous region. A representative sample of 100 men shows a normal distribution of hemoglobin concentration with a mean concentration of 17 g/dL and a standard error of 0.1 g/dL. Which of the following best represents the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL?",B,"To determine the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL, we can use the properties of the normal distribution. Given that the mean hemoglobin concentration is 17 g/dL with a standard error of 0.1 g/dL, we can calculate the z-score for a hemoglobin concentration of 18 g/dL.

The z-score is calculated as:

\[ z = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma} \]

where \(X\) is the value we're interested in (18 g/dL), \(\mu\) is the mean (17 g/dL), and \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation. However, we have the standard error (SE) given, which is 0.1 g/dL. The standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) can be estimated from the standard error (SE) using the formula:

\[ SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \]

where \(n\) is the sample size. In this case, \(n = 100\). Rearranging the formula to solve for \(\sigma\), we get:

\[ \sigma = SE \times \sqrt{n} = 0.1 \times \sqrt{100} = 0.1 \times 10 = 1 \]

Now, we can calculate the z-score:

\[ z = \frac{(18 - 17)}{1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 \]

Looking up the z-score of 1 in a standard normal distribution table, we find that approximately 84% of the values fall below this z-score. This means that 16% of the values fall above this z-score. However, since the question asks for the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL, the closest option to 16% is:

B. 15%

Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows mildly increased echogenicity of the liver. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be found in this patient?""",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be:

D. Increased CA 19-9 levels

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of cholestatic liver disease, which can be associated with elevated CA 19-9 levels. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, generalized itchiness, and jaundice, along with laboratory findings of elevated total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT, are consistent with this diagnosis. CA 19-9 is a tumor marker that can be elevated in various conditions, including cholangiocarcinoma, which is a type of cancer that can occur in cholestatic liver disease.

Options A, C, and E are less likely to be found in this patient. Inferior vena cava thrombosis is not typically associated with the symptoms and laboratory findings presented. Butterfly-shaped vertebrae are associated with Scheuermann's disease, which is not related to liver disease. Kayser-Fleischer rings are associated with Wilson's disease, which is characterized by copper accumulation in the liver and other organs and is not consistent with the patient's laboratory findings.

Option B, cutaneous xanthomas, can be associated with hyperlipidemia, which can occur in some liver diseases, but it is less specific than an elevated CA 19-9 in the context of cholestatic liver disease.",Success
"A 32-year-old pregnant woman presents to her physician with flu-like symptoms for the past 3 days. She has a runny nose, mild headache, and feels achy. She has a mild fever and diffuse rash over her body. She is concerned about the health of her baby and wants to know if there are any medications that will make her feel better in a short time. Currently, she is at her 29th week of gestation and has received the tetanus vaccination as part of the antenatal care program she received since she immigrated at the end of her first trimester from Romania. She is otherwise healthy. Considering this patient, she is at a higher risk of giving birth to a newborn who will present with which of the following options?",B,"The patient's symptoms and the fact that she has a diffuse rash raise concerns for a possible viral infection. However, the question seems to be focusing on potential cardiac anomalies in the newborn related to the mother's condition. Among the options provided, none are directly associated with the mother's current symptoms, but considering her recent immigration and the fact that she received the tetanus vaccination, it is important to rule out any potential infections that could have been contracted before or during her pregnancy, particularly those that could affect fetal heart development.

Given the options, the most relevant to potential cardiac anomalies in a newborn could be related to congenital infections, such as rubella or cytomegalovirus (CMV), which could potentially lead to cardiac defects including tricuspid valve regurgitation (Option E). However, it is important to note that the patient's symptoms do not specifically suggest either of these infections, and further evaluation would be necessary to determine the cause of her symptoms and the potential risk to the fetus.

In the context of the question, the best answer based on the information provided would be:

E. Tricuspid valve regurgitation

However, it is crucial for the physician to perform a thorough evaluation, including appropriate laboratory tests and imaging, to identify the cause of the mother's symptoms and to assess the health of the fetus. The management of the mother's symptoms and any potential risks to the fetus should be handled with care, considering her gestational age and the potential implications for the newborn's health.",Success
An investigator is studying bacterial adaptations to the environment in an infectious isolate and a noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B. Animals exposed to the noninfectious isolate do not develop symptoms of infection. The investigator cultivates the noninfectious isolate in a culture with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate. Some of the animals exposed to these bacteria develop symptoms of infection. Which of the following processes is most likely responsible for the described findings?,C,"The process most likely responsible for the described findings is C. Transformation. Transformation is the process by which a bacterium takes up DNA from its environment and incorporates it into its own genome. In this scenario, the noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B is cultured with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate, which means that the noninfectious bacteria could take up DNA from the infectious bacteria that contain genes responsible for virulence or infection. This would explain why some animals exposed to the noninfectious isolate after this process develop symptoms of infection, as the bacteria have now acquired the ability to cause disease through transformation.",Success
"A 40-year-old female with a past medical history of high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, and asthma presents to the primary care clinic today. She has tried several different statins, all of which have resulted in bothersome side effects. Her current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, albuterol, oral contraceptives, and a multivitamin. Her physical examination is unremarkable. Her blood pressure is 116/82 mm Hg and her heart rate is 82/min. You decide to initiate colesevelam (Welchol). Of the following, which is a concern with the initiation of this medication?",D,"The correct answer is D. Timing of the dosing of colesevelam should be separated from this patient’s other medications.

Colesevelam is a bile acid sequestrant used to lower cholesterol levels. It works by binding to bile acids in the intestines, which are then excreted rather than being reabsorbed. This process leads to the liver using more cholesterol to produce more bile acids, thus lowering cholesterol levels in the blood.

One of the concerns with colesevelam is that it can interfere with the absorption of other medications when taken concurrently. Colesevelam should be taken at least 2 hours before or 4 hours after other medications to avoid potential interactions. This is particularly important for the patient's levothyroxine, as colesevelam can significantly decrease the absorption of this medication, potentially leading to suboptimal treatment of her hyperthyroidism. The same applies to her oral contraceptives, as decreased absorption could affect their effectiveness. Therefore, careful timing of her medication dosing is crucial to ensure that all her medications work effectively.",Success
"A 62-year-old patient with a history of deep venous thrombosis is enrolled in a clinical trial for a new oral anticoagulant. This novel drug has the property where its clearance is relatively predictable based on patient demographics and can easily be extrapolated from other data. Its metabolism and volume of distribution also do not change dramatically from patient to patient. The investigator wants to make sure that the plasma concentration of the drug in this patient is 15 mg/L and he knows the following drug characteristics.

Bioavailability: 50%
Drug half-life: 2 hours
Volume of distribution: 14.3 liters

Which of the following represents the maintenance dose that should be given to this patient every 8 hours?",D,"To find the maintenance dose, we need to use the formula:

\[Dose = \frac{C_{ss} \times V_d \times F}{1-e^{-\frac{t_{1/2}}{t_{dose}}}}\]

Where:
- \(C_{ss}\) is the steady-state concentration (15 mg/L in this case)
- \(V_d\) is the volume of distribution (14.3 liters in this case)
- \(F\) is the bioavailability (0.5 or 50% in this case)
- \(t_{1/2}\) is the half-life of the drug (2 hours in this case)
- \(t_{dose}\) is the dosing interval (8 hours in this case)

First, we need to calculate the exponent \(-\frac{t_{1/2}}{t_{dose}}\):

\[-\frac{t_{1/2}}{t_{dose}} = -\frac{2}{8} = -0.25\]

Then we calculate \(1-e^{-0.25}\):

\[1-e^{-0.25} = 1-e^{-0.25} = 1-0.7788 = 0.2212\]

Now we can calculate the dose:

\[Dose = \frac{15 \times 14.3 \times 0.5}{0.2212} = \frac{107.25}{0.2212} = 485.01\]

The closest answer to 485.01 mg is option B, 430 milligrams. However, it's important to note that the exact answer is not listed among the options, but option B is the closest to our calculated value. In a real-world scenario, the dose would likely be adjusted to the nearest available dose, which in this case would be 430 mg. 

Therefore, the answer is:

B. 430 milligrams",Success
"A 7-day-old infant boy presents to an emergency department due to poor feeding. His parents are recent immigrants to the United States.

Tetanus is characterized by increased muscle tone, clenched jaw (lockjaw), and clenched hands, all of which are present in this infant. The organism Clostridium tetani is commonly found in soil and can enter the body through a break in the skin or, in this case, potentially through the umbilical stump if it was not properly cared for after birth. The lack of prenatal care and vaccination, as well as the home birth, increase the risk of this infection. The other options do not typically present with the described symptoms.",Success

VIPoma, or vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumor, is a rare type of neuroendocrine tumor that can cause symptoms such as chronic diarrhea, facial flushing, and electrolyte imbalances, including hypokalemia (low potassium levels). The symptoms are due to the excessive production of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which leads to watery diarrhea and electrolyte loss. The association with a genetic mutation in the menin 1 gene on chromosome 11 also points towards a possible diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), which can include VIPoma as one of its manifestations.",Success
"A 69-year-old gentleman presents to his primary care physician for pain in his right shoulder. The patient was helping his son move this past weekend, and he noticed after the move that he had pain and weakness in his right shoulder. The patient thought that this pain was just him being in poor shape so he started going to the gym and lifting weights which made his symptoms significantly worse. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, obesity, and asthma. His current medications include albuterol, lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide. On physical exam you note an obese gentleman who seems to be in pain. You note prominent weakness of external rotation of his right upper extremity. When you ask the patient to slowly lower his right arm to his side when he holds it overhead, you note that he suddenly drops his arm and appears to be in pain. The patient's strength is 1/5 for abduction of the right arm. Which of the following is most likely injured in this patient?",A,"The most likely injured muscle in this patient is the supraspinatus (Option A). The patient's history of sudden onset of pain and weakness in the right shoulder after lifting heavy objects, coupled with the physical exam findings of weakness in abduction (lifting the arm away from the body) and the drop-arm sign (inability to lower the arm slowly from a raised position due to pain) are indicative of a supraspinatus injury or tear. This muscle is part of the rotator cuff and is particularly important for abduction of the arm.

The other options (B, C, D, and E) are also muscles that can be involved in shoulder injuries, but the clinical presentation and exam findings are most consistent with a supraspinatus injury. The infraspinatus and teres minor are involved in external rotation of the shoulder, the subscapularis in internal rotation, and the deltoid in abduction, but the specific drop-arm sign and the patient's description of pain and weakness when lifting are more indicative of a supraspinatus issue.",Success

Laboratory studies show decreased haptoglobin levels and increased LDH levels. A photomicrograph of a peripheral blood smear is shown. Which of the following is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?",D,"The newborn's symptoms of fever, yellow discoloration of skin and sclerae (jaundice), loss of flexion in the extremities, splenomegaly, and cyanosis, along with laboratory findings of decreased haptoglobin levels and increased LDH levels, are indicative of hemolysis. The presence of maternal antibodies against the rhesus D antigen (Option B) is the most likely cause of this condition, known as Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn (HDN) or Hemolytic Disease of the Fetus and Newborn (HDFN).

In this scenario, the mother is Rh+, but the newborn could have inherited the RhD antigen from the father, making the newborn Rh+. During delivery, fetal red blood cells (RBCs) can enter the maternal circulation. If the mother is Rh- and the fetus is Rh+, the mother's immune system may produce IgG antibodies against the RhD antigen on the fetal RBCs. These antibodies can cross the placenta and attack the fetal RBCs, leading to hemolysis and the symptoms described.

The other options do not fit the clinical presentation as well:

A. Decrease in the reduced form of glutathione is associated with conditions like G6PD deficiency, which can cause hemolysis but is not specifically related to the Rh incompatibility scenario described.

C. Point mutation in β-globin is associated with conditions like sickle cell anemia or β-thalassemia, which also cause hemolytic anemia but do not involve maternal antibodies.

On physical examination, the patient has altered mentation and is agitated and diaphoretic. The patient also has a goiter, exophthalmos, warm skin, and a hand tremor. She is started on intravenous fluids. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?",E,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis, specifically thyroid storm. Thyroid storm is a medical emergency characterized by high fever, tachycardia, agitation, sweating, vomiting, and other symptoms due to extremely high levels of thyroid hormones. The presence of a goiter and exophthalmos also suggest a history of hyperthyroidism, likely due to Graves' disease.

The best treatment option for this patient is E. Propranolol. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can help to control the symptoms of thyroid storm by blocking the effects of thyroid hormones on the heart and other organs. It can help to reduce tachycardia, tremor, anxiety, and other symptoms. In addition to propranolol, other treatments may be necessary, such as antithyroid medications, iodine, and corticosteroids, depending on the severity of the storm and the underlying cause of hyperthyroidism.

Options A, B, C, and D are not appropriate for the treatment of thyroid storm. Antibiotics are not indicated unless there is a concurrent infection. Carotid massage is not relevant to the treatment of thyroid storm. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be used to control anxiety and agitation but does not address the underlying cause of thyroid storm.

"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because he was vomiting and seemed abnormally sleepy at home. On presentation, he is found to be confused and very lethargic. His parents said that he has had a fever and cough for several days prior to presentation and was given an over the counter medication. Physical exam of this patient reveals mild hepatomegaly and dry mucous membranes. Which of the following effects would the drug most likely also have on the nephron?",B,"The symptoms described (vomiting, confusion, lethargy, fever, cough, hepatomegaly, and dry mucous membranes) suggest that the patient may have taken an overdose of an over-the-counter medication, possibly acetaminophen (paracetamol), which is known to cause hepatotoxicity. Acetaminophen overdose can also lead to renal impairment, but its direct effect on the nephron is not primarily through altering the tone of the afferent and efferent arterioles.

However, if we are to consider the effects of the medication on the nephron based on the options provided, we can look at the general effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are commonly used for fever and cough and can affect renal blood flow.

NSAIDs can cause constriction of the afferent arteriole due to their inhibitory effect on prostaglandin synthesis. Prostaglandins are vasodilators and play a crucial role in maintaining renal blood flow, particularly in the afferent arterioles. By inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, NSAIDs can lead to a reduction in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, NSAIDs typically do not have a significant effect on the efferent arteriole.

Therefore, the most likely answer based on the options provided and the potential effects of NSAIDs on the nephron would be:

B. Constriction of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole

It is important to note that the specific medication taken by the patient is not mentioned, and the effects described can vary depending on the exact medication. Acetaminophen itself does not typically cause significant renal effects at therapeutic doses but can cause renal tubular damage at toxic doses, primarily through metabolic byproducts rather than direct vasoactive effects on the afferent and efferent arterioles.",Success

Hereditary angioedema. Hereditary angioedema is a genetic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of swelling in various parts of the body, including the face, hands, and neck, and can also cause abdominal pain. The fact that the patient's mother and maternal aunt have a similar condition suggests a genetic component, and the low C1-inhibitor levels are consistent with this diagnosis.

This test is typically performed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation to screen for gestational diabetes, which is a common condition that can develop during pregnancy. The oral glucose challenge test involves drinking a glucose solution and then having blood glucose levels checked one hour later. If the blood glucose level is elevated, a more comprehensive glucose tolerance test may be recommended to confirm a diagnosis of gestational diabetes.

Options B, C, D, and E are also important aspects of prenatal care, but they are not the most appropriate next step at this point in the pregnancy for this patient. Cardiotocography (option B) is used to monitor the fetal heart rate and uterine contractions, but it is not typically performed as a routine screening test at this gestational age. Rh antibody testing (option C) is important for Rh-negative women, but this patient's blood type is B positive, so she is not at risk for Rh incompatibility.

Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows large dense breasts; a 5-cm, nontender, multinodular mass is palpated in the right outer quadrant of the right breast. There are no changes in the skin or nipple. There is no palpable cervical or axillary adenopathy. Mammography shows a smooth polylobulated mass. Biopsy of the mass shows papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The most likely diagnosis based on the given information is B. Phyllodes tumor. This is because the biopsy shows papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia, which is characteristic of phyllodes tumors. These tumors are typically multinodular, can grow rapidly, and are often larger than 5 cm. They are usually found in women in their 40s and 50s and can be benign, borderline, or malignant.

"A 72-year-old Caucasian male presents to your office with dysphagia and halitosis. If this patient is also found to have cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction, which of the following is the most likely cause of his presenting symptoms?",E,"The most likely cause of the patient's presenting symptoms, including dysphagia, halitosis, and cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction, is:

E. Zenker's diverticulum

Zenker's diverticulum is a condition where a pouch forms in the posterior wall of the pharynx, typically at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle. This can lead to dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) due to the pouch obstructing the esophagus and halitosis (bad breath) due to food particles getting trapped in the pouch. The cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction can also contribute to the symptoms by impairing the normal swallowing mechanism.",Success
"A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because he has not been able to walk since waking up that morning. His mother said that when he tried to get out of bed that he was unable to stand without support. He also complained of prickling in his hands and feet. Three weeks ago, he had a fever, dry cough, and a sore throat. The fever and sore throat subsided a week after they began, but the cough is persisting. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medication. His vital signs are within normal limits. The lungs are clear to auscultation.

A lumbar puncture is performed; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a leukocyte count of 2/mm3, a glucose concentration of 60 mg/dL, and a protein concentration of 91 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in treatment?""",A,"The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a rapidly progressive, autoimmune-mediated polyneuropathy. The patient's history of a preceding respiratory illness, the acute onset of symmetric limb weakness, the absence of deep tendon reflexes, and the characteristic cerebrospinal fluid findings of albuminocytological dissociation (normal cell count with elevated protein) are all indicative of GBS.

The most appropriate next step in treatment for Guillain-Barré syndrome is:

A. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)

IVIG is one of the standard treatments for GBS, along with plasma exchange. It works by modulating the immune response and can help to halt the progression of the disease and improve recovery. Prednisone (Option B) is not typically used in the acute phase of GBS. Botulism antitoxin (Option C) is not indicated as there is no evidence of botulism in the clinical presentation. Intravenous acyclovir (Option D) is used for viral infections, particularly herpes simplex virus, which is not suggested in this case. Gabapentin (Option E) is used for neuropathic pain and would not be the initial treatment of choice for GBS.",Success

He states that he must check everything 7 times in a specific order and if he goes out of order he must start from the beginning and perform it all over. He has recently been fired from his job because he is always late and lost his fiancee as she could not deal with his habits anymore. The physician explained that cognitive-behavioral therapy may be of assistance and also prescribed clomipramine. Which of the following is the mechanism of reaction of clomipramine?",D,"The mechanism of action of clomipramine is that it blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D. Blocks reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin

Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that primarily functions by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, thus increasing the levels of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. This can help alleviate symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and other anxiety disorders.",Success
"A 35-year-old Caucasian female presents to the hospital alarmed by her recent truncal weight gain, facial hair growth, and thinning skin. During the physical exam, the physician finds that the patient is hypertensive. Serum analysis reveals hyperglycemia. The physician suspects a pituitary adenoma. Which dexamethasone test result would help confirm the physician's suspicions?",E,"The dexamethasone suppression test is used to help diagnose Cushing's syndrome and determine its cause. In this case, the patient presents with symptoms consistent with Cushing's syndrome, which can be caused by a pituitary adenoma leading to excess ACTH production. The test involves administering dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, and measuring the response of the pituitary gland by observing changes in ACTH levels.

For a pituitary source of Cushing's syndrome, the expected response to the dexamethasone suppression test is as follows:

- Low-dose dexamethasone suppression test: ACTH levels do not suppress, indicating that the pituitary gland is not responding to the negative feedback of high cortisol levels, which is typical in Cushing's disease due to a pituitary adenoma.
- High-dose dexamethasone suppression test: ACTH levels do suppress, indicating that the pituitary tumor is sensitive to high doses of dexamethasone, which is a characteristic of Cushing's disease.

Therefore, the answer that would help confirm the physician's suspicions of a pituitary adenoma is:

E. Low-dose, no change in ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH",Success
"A 24-year-old man with chronic back pain comes to the physician to establish care after moving to Florida. He complains of anxiety, nausea, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and diarrhea for three days. He denies smoking, drinking alcohol, and using illicit drugs. He appears restless. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 150/86 mm Hg. Physical examination shows dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and piloerection. His abdominal exam shows diffuse mild tenderness. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding. His hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 8,000/mm, and platelet count is 250,000/mm3; serum studies and urinalysis show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",C,"The patient's symptoms of anxiety, nausea, abdominal cramping, vomiting, diarrhea, restlessness, dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and piloerection, along with his denial of smoking, drinking alcohol, and using illicit drugs, suggest a withdrawal syndrome. The absence of rebound tenderness or guarding and normal laboratory results further support this diagnosis rather than an acute surgical abdomen.

Given the context of chronic back pain and the symptoms of withdrawal, the most likely scenario is opioid withdrawal. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for managing opioid withdrawal is methadone (Option C), which is a long-acting opioid agonist used for detoxification and maintenance treatment in opioid dependence. Methadone can help alleviate withdrawal symptoms and cravings, allowing the patient to stabilize and potentially transition to a non-opioid treatment for his back pain.

Options A (Lorazepam), B (Naltrexone), D (Morphine), and E (Naloxone) are not the first-line treatments for opioid withdrawal. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine used for anxiety and seizures but is not typically used for opioid withdrawal. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist used for the prevention of relapse in opioid-dependent patients after detoxification, but it is not used to manage acute withdrawal symptoms. Morphine is an opioid agonist that could potentially alleviate withdrawal symptoms but would not be an appropriate long-term solution for managing opioid withdrawal. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used for reversing acute opioid overdose but is not suitable for managing withdrawal symptoms.",Success
A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of cough and progressively worsening difficulty walking up the stairs in his apartment. He has noticed that it is easier for him to climb the stairs after he has exercised. He has also had a 4.6-kg (10.1-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The pupils are equal and react sluggishly to light. Muscle strength in the proximal lower extremity is initially 3/5 but increases to 5/5 after repeated muscle tapping. His achilles reflex is 1+. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,E,"The most likely diagnosis for the 53-year-old man with the symptoms described is E. Lambert-Eaton syndrome. This diagnosis is supported by several key features in the patient's history and examination findings:

1. Progressive difficulty walking up stairs, which is a symptom of muscle weakness.
2. The observation that climbing stairs is easier after exercise, which is a characteristic feature of Lambert-Eaton syndrome known as ""paradoxical improvement with exercise.""
3. Weight loss over the past 6 months, which can be associated with the underlying malignancy that often accompanies Lambert-Eaton syndrome.
4. A history of smoking, which is a risk factor for the development of certain malignancies, such as small cell lung cancer, which is often associated with Lambert-Eaton syndrome.
5. Muscle strength initially 3/5 but increasing to 5/5 after repeated muscle tapping, which is consistent with the electrophysiological pattern seen in Lambert-Eaton syndrome.
6. A 1+ Achilles reflex, which is diminished but not absent, as would be expected in other conditions that affect the peripheral nerves.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

A. Polymyalgia rheumatica typically presents with pain and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, and hips but does not usually involve muscle weakness or the paradoxical improvement with exercise seen in this patient.

B. Myasthenia gravis can cause muscle weakness, but it does not typically present with the paradoxical improvement with exercise that is characteristic of Lambert-Eaton syndrome. Instead, symptoms tend to worsen with sustained activity.

C. Dermatomyositis can cause muscle weakness and weight loss, but it is typically associated with skin rashes and inflammation, which are not mentioned in this case.

D. Hypothyroidism can cause muscle weakness and weight gain, not weight loss. It also does not present with the paradoxical improvement with exercise seen in this patient.

Which of the following is the best response to the patient's daughter's request?",B,"The best response to the patient's daughter's request is E. Tell the patient's daughter that the patient must be informed of the diagnosis. This is because the patient has a right to know her own medical condition, which is a fundamental principle of patient autonomy in medical ethics. However, it is important to handle this situation with sensitivity and to involve the family in a discussion about how and when to inform the patient, taking into account her emotional and psychological well-being.

Mean corpuscular volume: 70 um^3
Iron: 250 ug/dL
Ferritin: 300 ng/mL
Total iron binding capacity: 200 mcg/dL^3

Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen in this patient?",A,"The patient's mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 70 um^3, which is below the normal range (80-100 um^3), indicating microcytosis. The low MCV, along with the presence of diabetes and a history of alcohol abuse, suggests that the patient may have microcytic anemia, which is often associated with iron deficiency or chronic disease anemia. However, the iron studies show that the patient's serum iron, ferritin, and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) are all within or above the normal range, suggesting that iron deficiency is unlikely.

Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse, the most likely finding would be related to alcohol-induced anemia. Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to a variety of hematological abnormalities, including microcytic anemia due to nutritional deficiencies (e.g., folate, B12, iron), direct toxic effects of alcohol on the bone marrow, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's erythrocytes are likely to be hypochromatic, which means they have a decreased amount of hemoglobin relative to their size (Option D). This is a characteristic feature of microcytic anemia and would be consistent with the patient's low MCV.

The other options are less likely:
A. Erythroblasts with mitochondrial iron deposits would be seen in sideroblastic anemia, which is not suggested by the patient's iron studies.
B. Erythrocytes lacking central pallor would be seen in macrocytic anemia, which is not consistent with the patient's microcytic anemia.
C. Erythrocytes with a ring of relative pallor would be seen in normocytic anemia, which is not consistent with the patient's microcytic anemia.
E. Inclusions of denatured hemoglobin would be seen in conditions like sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, which are not suggested by the patient's history or laboratory results.",Success
"A 75-year-old man becomes pulseless in the cardiac intensive care unit 48 hours after admission for ST-elevation myocardial infarction. His blood pressure is 50/20 mm Hg. The ECG monitor shows a tachycardic irregular rhythm with erratic undulations, but no discernible P waves or QRS complexes. During immediate advanced cardiac life support, two attempts at defibrillation are made, after which the patient is given 1 mg of IV epinephrine.

His sensations are decreased on his left side, including his face. The examination of extraocular movements is shown in the image. A lesion in which of the following locations explains the findings during eye examination?",E,"The symptoms described, including left-sided numbness, diplopia, and blurring of vision, particularly with the diplopia being more prominent on left-side lateral gaze, suggest a lesion affecting the lateral gaze of the left eye. The examination of extraocular movements is not provided in the question, but assuming it is consistent with the symptoms described, the most likely location of the lesion is the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF).

The MLF is a critical pathway for coordinating conjugate eye movements and is involved in the coordination of lateral gaze. A lesion in the MLF can result in internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), which is characterized by a failure of the adduction of one eye and nystagmus of the abducting eye when attempting to look to the side of the lesion. Given the patient's symptoms of diplopia that is worse on left-side lateral gaze, this is consistent with a right-sided MLF lesion, affecting the left eye's ability to adduct (move medially).

E. Medial longitudinal fasciculus",Success

The crying infant's lungs are clear to auscultation. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?",D,"The symptoms and signs described in the question suggest that the newborn might be suffering from a congenital heart defect, specifically a cyanotic heart defect, given the bluish discoloration of her lips (cyanosis) and the worsening of the cyanosis during feeding. The improvement of cyanosis when the baby cries could be due to the increased blood flow and oxygenation that crying induces. The heart rate and blood pressure are also indicative of a newborn in distress.

Option B, a boot-shaped heart on chest x-ray, is characteristic of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), a congenital heart defect that can present with cyanosis and respiratory distress. TOF consists of four defects: a ventricular septal defect (VSD), pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. The ""boot-shaped"" or ""coeur en sabot"" appearance on chest x-ray is due to the enlargement of the right ventricle and the narrowing of the pulmonary artery, which gives the heart a distinctive shape.

The other options do not fit the clinical presentation as well:

A. Diffuse reticulogranular densities on chest x-ray could indicate a lung disease or infection, but this is not the most likely diagnosis given the presence of cyanosis and the improvement with crying, which are more indicative of a cardiac issue.

C. Passage of a gastric catheter through the mouth not possible would suggest an esophageal atresia or other obstruction in the upper digestive tract, which does not explain the respiratory distress and cyanosis.

D. Passage of a catheter through the nasal cavity not possible could indicate a nasal obstruction, which would not explain the respiratory distress and cyanosis.

E. Scaphoid abdomen refers to an inward curvature of the abdomen, which is not related to the symptoms described and does not explain the respiratory distress and cyanosis.

Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.3 mU/L
Total T4 160 nmol/L
Free T4 13 pmol/L
Corresponding to the obtained results, how should the patient be managed?",B,"The patient's thyroid function tests indicate a low TSH level (0.3 mU/L) and a normal total T4 (160 nmol/L) and free T4 (13 pmol/L). A low TSH with a normal free T4 suggests subclinical hyperthyroidism. In pregnancy, the thyroid undergoes physiological changes to meet the increased metabolic demands, which can sometimes mimic hyperthyroidism. However, since the patient is symptomatic with fatigue and depression, it is important to rule out other causes and ensure that her thyroid status is not contributing to her symptoms.

Option D, prescribing methimazole, is used to treat hyperthyroidism, but it is not typically the first-line treatment in pregnancy due to potential risks to the fetus. Levothyroxine (Option A) is used to treat hypothyroidism and would not be appropriate in this case.

Given the patient's symptoms and the possibility of subclinical hyperthyroidism, the best initial step would be to further investigate the cause of her symptoms. Option C, recommending an additional anti-TPO (thyroid peroxidase) test, can help determine if there is an autoimmune component to her thyroid condition. Anti-TPO antibodies can be present in conditions such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' disease, which could explain her symptoms.

Option E, recommending an additional T3 assessment, could also be considered if there is a suspicion of T3 toxicosis, which is a less common form of hyperthyroidism. However, since the patient's symptoms are more aligned with fatigue and depression, which are not typically associated with hyperthyroidism, this might not be the first test to order.

Considering the options, the most appropriate initial management would be Option C, to recommend an additional anti-TPO test, to further evaluate the thyroid condition and determine if there is an autoimmune etiology contributing to her symptoms. If the anti-TPO test is positive, further management would depend on the results and the patient's clinical status. If the anti-TPO test is negative and there are no other clear causes for her symptoms, closer monitoring and possibly a referral to a mental health professional for her depressed mood could be considered.",Success

His blood pressure is 115/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 65/min, and the temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F). The patient states that he has been having trouble chewing his food, but is not experiencing any pain. The patient is up to date on all of his immunizations. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his facial swelling?",B,"Based on the information provided, the most likely cause of the patient's facial swelling is Option B: a benign salivary gland tumor composed of stromal and epithelial tissue. This type of tumor, often referred to as a pleomorphic adenoma, is the most common type of salivary gland tumor and typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass. The patient's lack of lymphadenopathy, erythema, and neurological deficits, as well as the absence of pain, are consistent with a benign process. The difficulty in chewing without pain also suggests a mass in the salivary gland rather than an acute infection or inflammation.",Success
"A 15-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother. His mother reports multiple instances over the past month when she walked into his room while he was masturbating. She is worried he may be going through some sort of “problem.” He is currently in 9th grade; his mother says that he is the captain of his high school wrestling team and does reasonably well in school. On examination, he seems embarrassed and avoids making eye contact. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The most appropriate next step in management would be to reassure the mother. Masturbation is a normal and healthy part of sexual development and exploration, particularly during adolescence. It is important to provide the patient and his mother with accurate information about sexual health and development, and to address any concerns or misconceptions they may have. There is no need for medical intervention or therapy in this case, as the behavior is not indicative of a problem or disorder. Options A, B, C, and E are not appropriate in this situation.",Success
"A 64-year-old man presents to the clinic with easy fatigability and breathlessness when climbing stairs for the last 2 weeks. He also mentions that he occasionally has bouts of cough at night after about 2–3 hours of sleep which is relieved when he sits upright. He denies shortness of breath at rest, palpitations, and loss of consciousness. He has had hypertension for the last 20 years and is on antihypertensive medications. On physical examination, his temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 104/min, blood pressure is 122/82 mm Hg, and respirations are 18/min. Chest auscultation reveals crackles over the lung bases bilaterally. Examination of his abdomen reveals mildly tender hepatomegaly. Laboratory investigation results include a hemoglobin of 14.8 g/dL (9.18 mmol/L) and an elevated serum B-type natriuretic peptide. His two-dimensional echocardiogram reveals an enlarged left atrium and an ejection fraction of 55%. Which of the following novel drugs is most likely to benefit the patient in addition to valsartan?",D,"The patient's symptoms and examination findings are suggestive of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The presence of nocturnal cough, bilateral lung crackles, and hepatomegaly, along with the elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, point towards this diagnosis. Among the options provided, sacubitril (option D) is the most likely to benefit the patient in addition to valsartan.

Sacubitril is a prodrug of the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril, which is combined with the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan in a single pill (sacubitril/valsartan). This combination is approved for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but it may also have benefits in patients with HFpEF. Neprilysin is an enzyme that breaks down natriuretic peptides, and sacubitril inhibits this enzyme, leading to increased levels of natriuretic peptides, which have vasodilatory and natriuretic effects. This can help reduce the workload on the heart and improve symptoms in heart failure patients.

The other options are not as relevant to the patient's condition:
A. Etanercept is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.
B. Ivabradine is a heart rate-lowering medication used for the treatment of stable angina and chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
C. Moxonidine is an alpha-2 agonist used for the treatment of hypertension.
E. Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor used for the treatment of hypertension.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Sacubitril.",Success
"A 69-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for trouble sleeping. The patient states that he recently retired from working the day shift at a cemetery. When the patient retired, his goal was to finally be able to go out with his wife; however, he finds that he is unable to stay awake past 6 pm in the evening. His inability to stay awake has been straining his marriage as his wife is disappointed that they cannot do any activities in the evening together. The patient has tried drinking caffeine but finds that it does not help. The patient’s wife claims that the patient seems to sleep peacefully, and the patient states he feels rested when he awakes. The patient has a past medical history of irritable bowel syndrome which is managed with fiber supplements. The patient’s neurological exam is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The most likely diagnosis for the patient is C. Advanced sleep phase disorder. This is characterized by an internal body clock that is set earlier than the typical 24-hour cycle, causing the person to feel sleepy much earlier in the evening and wake up earlier in the morning than most people. The patient's symptoms of feeling rested when he awakes and being unable to stay awake past 6 pm, despite his efforts to stay awake with caffeine, are consistent with this disorder. The fact that his neurological exam is within normal limits and that he has no other medical conditions that could be causing his sleep issues also supports this diagnosis.",Success
"A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She feels well. Six months ago, she was vaccinated against influenza. Her last mammography 1 year ago showed no abnormalities. Two years ago, a pap smear and colonoscopy were normal. She has a history of hypertension. Her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 50 years. She emigrated from Japan 30 years ago. She has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for the last 18 years. She drinks 4–5 glasses of wine per day. She goes ballroom dancing twice each week. Her medications include enalapril and low-dose aspirin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 50 kg (110 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows a soft S4 gallop. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",B,"The most appropriate next step in management for this 62-year-old woman would be:

B. Dual-energy x-ray bone absorptiometry

Given her age and history of smoking and alcohol consumption, she is at risk for osteoporosis. The bone density scan (DXA or DEXA scan) would be appropriate to assess her bone density and determine if she has osteoporosis or osteopenia, which could guide further management such as lifestyle modifications or pharmacological treatment.

While some of the other options may be indicated under different circumstances, they are not the most appropriate next step based on the information provided:

A. Pap smear - She had a normal pap smear two years ago, and typically, pap smears are repeated every 3-5 years if previous results have been normal.

C. Abdominal ultrasonography - There is no indication for this based on the information provided.

D. Low-dose chest CT - This is not typically indicated for routine screening in an asymptomatic patient without a significant history of lung disease or exposure.

E. Transesophageal echocardiography - This is a more invasive test typically used to evaluate specific cardiac conditions and is not indicated for routine screening in an asymptomatic patient. The soft S4 gallop noted on examination may be related to her hypertension and age, but further evaluation with a transthoracic echocardiogram might be more appropriate initially if there are concerns about cardiac function.",Success

This is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults and can be associated with malignancies such as Hodgkin's lymphoma. The presence of 4+ proteinuria and fatty casts in the urinalysis, along with low serum albumin (hypoalbuminemia), are indicative of nephrotic syndrome, which is often seen in membranous nephropathy. The edema that the patient is experiencing is also a typical symptom of nephrotic syndrome due to the loss of albumin and subsequent decrease in oncotic pressure.",Success

"A 34-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of colicky abdominal pain and diarrhea. He has bowel movements 10–12 times daily; the stool contains blood and mucus. He constantly has the urge to defecate. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the abdomen shows diffuse tenderness to palpation. Serum concentration of C-reactive protein is 20 mg/L (N<10). Colonoscopy shows a bleeding, ulcerated rectal mucosa with several pseudopolyps. Which of the following is this patient at greatest risk of developing?",C,"The patient's symptoms and findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affects the colon and rectum. Ulcerative colitis is characterized by bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and the presence of pseudopolyps and ulcerations in the colon and rectum, as seen in the colonoscopy. The elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level also suggests an inflammatory process.

Among the given options, the greatest risk for a patient with ulcerative colitis is developing colorectal cancer (Option C). Long-standing ulcerative colitis, particularly when it involves the entire colon (pancolitis), increases the risk of colorectal cancer. This risk increases over time, with the risk being higher after 8-10 years of disease. Regular colonoscopies are recommended for patients with ulcerative colitis to monitor for signs of dysplasia or cancer.

Options A, B, D, and E are not directly related to the complications of ulcerative colitis, although some patients may develop extraintestinal manifestations of IBD such as oral ulcers (Option B). Hemolytic uremic syndrome (Option A) is typically associated with certain bacterial infections and is not a common complication of ulcerative colitis.

"A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of a headache. The last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She also reports having a mild headache for 1 month. There has been a grape-like mass protruding from her vagina for the last 15 days. On examination, the fundus of the uterus is at the level of the umbilicus and no fetal heart sounds are heard. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 160/100 mm Hg, pulse rate 108/min. On USG examination, no fetal parts are seen. What will be the genotype of the substance which will be aspirated by dilation and evacuation?",E,"The description given in the question suggests a diagnosis of a molar pregnancy, specifically a complete hydatidiform mole. The presence of a grape-like mass protruding from the vagina, the absence of fetal parts on ultrasound, and the enlarged uterus are all indicative of this condition. A complete hydatidiform mole is characterized by an empty gestational sac with no embryo or fetal tissue, and the uterus is often larger than expected for the gestational age due to the mass of the molar tissue.

Complete moles are typically the result of a single sperm fertilizing an empty egg (nulecule ovum), leading to disomy for the paternal genome and a karyotype of 69,XXY, 69,XYY, or rarely 69,XXX, depending on whether the sperm was X-bearing or Y-bearing and whether the duplication was of the X or Y chromosome. However, the most common karyotype in complete moles is 69,XXY.

A. 69XXY",Success
"A 42-year-old woman comes to the clinic for a routine annual exam. She recently moved from New Jersey, and her medical records show a total colectomy. The patient reports that she has had annual colonoscopies since she was 10 years of age because her father had “a condition with his colon.” What is the genetic inheritance pattern of the patient’s disease?",A,"The genetic inheritance pattern of the patient's disease is most likely A. Autosomal dominant. This is because she has a family history of a ""condition with his colon"" in her father, and she has been undergoing annual colonoscopies since a young age, which suggests a known familial risk. The fact that she has had a total colectomy also indicates a severe colon condition that is often associated with genetic syndromes such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or Lynch syndrome, both of which are typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.",Success
"A 2-day-old infant male is brought to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of vomiting and irritability. He was born at home and had unreliable prenatal care because his parents have been experiencing housing instability. About a day after birth, he started to become lethargic and was feeding poorly. His parents thought that he might just be tired so they put him to bed; however, by the next morning he started to vomit and act extremely irritable. On presentation, he is found to have nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelles. Based on this presentation, appropriate cultures are obtained and he is placed on empiric antibiotics. After all cultures grow out the same gram-positive bacteria, the patient is narrowed to penicillin G. Which of the following is a characteristic of the most likely organism that is causing this patient's symptoms?",B,"The patient's presentation, including the nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelles, suggests a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. The fact that the patient is a newborn and has had unreliable prenatal care further supports this diagnosis, as neonatal meningitis can be caused by various organisms, including group B Streptococcus (GBS), Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. However, since the patient was narrowed to penicillin G after cultures grew out the same gram-positive bacteria, this suggests that the causative organism is likely sensitive to penicillin G. Among the options given, the characteristic that matches the most likely organism is:

B. Enlarges hemolytic area of Staphylococcus aureus

This characteristic describes the interaction between Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) and Staphylococcus aureus on a blood agar plate, where S. pyogenes can enlarge the hemolytic area of S. aureus due to the production of streptokinase, which activates plasminogen to plasmin, leading to fibrinolysis and an enhanced zone of hemolysis. However, this is not a direct characteristic of the organism causing the infant's symptoms but rather an interaction seen in laboratory settings.

The most likely causative organism in this scenario is Group B Streptococcus (GBS), which is a gram-positive bacterium and a common cause of neonatal meningitis. GBS does not create a green zone of hemolysis on blood agar (A), does not produce lipooligosaccharide (C), does not produce a toxin that increases cAMP levels (D), and does not exhibit tumbling motility in broth at 22 degrees (E). GBS is typically sensitive to penicillin G, which is why the patient was narrowed to this antibiotic after cultures grew out.",Success

Rather than fight it, I just try to enjoy myself and eat what I want.” Which of the following defense mechanisms best describes the patient's response to the physician?",A,"The patient's response to the physician can be best described by the defense mechanism of Rationalization (Option A). Rationalization is a defense mechanism in which the individual justifies their actions or feelings with logical reasons, even if these reasons are not truly valid or relevant. In this case, the patient is rationalizing his unhealthy eating habits and weight gain by attributing them to a genetic predisposition and a desire for personal enjoyment, rather than taking responsibility for his dietary choices.",Success

Which of the following is the best diagnostic test?",D,"Given the patient's symptoms of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss, along with his laboratory results showing elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and an amber/brown urine color, the best diagnostic test to pursue would be option D: Viral core antibody. This test is often used to detect acute or recent infections with viruses such as Hepatitis A, B, or C, which can cause liver inflammation and lead to the symptoms and lab findings seen in this patient. The patient's lifestyle, including alcohol use, marijuana use, and multiple sexual partners, also increases the risk of viral hepatitis.

The other options are less likely to be relevant:
A. CAGE questions - This is a screening tool for alcohol abuse, which could be relevant given the patient's alcohol use, but it does not diagnose a specific condition causing the symptoms.
B. Direct influenza antigen - This would be used to diagnose influenza, which does not typically present with the specific symptoms or lab findings seen in this case.
C. Uretheral swab and culture - This would be used to diagnose a urinary tract infection or sexually transmitted infection, but the patient's symptoms and lab findings suggest a systemic illness more consistent with viral hepatitis.
E. Viral surface antibody - This could indicate past exposure or immunity to a virus, but the viral core antibody test is more indicative of a recent or acute infection, which is more relevant given the patient's symptoms.",Success
A 63-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion in addition to a 1-month history of ankle swelling.

An ECG shows right bundle branch block. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema?,D,"The most likely etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema is D. Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure. The clinical presentation of fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, ankle swelling, a widely split S2 that varies with respiration, and an ECG showing right bundle branch block is consistent with right-sided heart failure. In right-sided heart failure, the failure of the heart to pump blood efficiently leads to a backup of blood in the veins, increasing capillary hydrostatic pressure and causing fluid to leak into the interstitial space, leading to peripheral edema, particularly in the lower extremities.",Success
"A 62-year-old man presents with bright red blood in his stool which occurred 2 times this week. He denies fever, weight loss, pain, pruritus or urinary symptoms.

His vitals are a temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg, pulse of 78/min, and respiratory rate of 12/min. Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen with shifting dullness on percussion. In addition, multiple purple spider web-like lesions are present on the chest and arms, which blanch when pressure is applied. Fecal occult blood test is negative. On anoscopy, a non-tender, dilated vascular protrusion is noted superior to the pectinate line. Which of the following is most likely true about this patient’s current symptoms?",B,"The patient's presentation is most consistent with bleeding from esophageal varices, which is a complication of portal hypertension. The multiple purple spider web-like lesions on the chest and arms, which blanch when pressure is applied, are characteristic of spider angiomas, a common finding in patients with liver disease. The distended abdomen with shifting dullness on percussion suggests ascites, another sign of advanced liver disease. The non-tender, dilated vascular protrusion noted superior to the pectinate line on anoscopy is consistent with rectal varices, which can occur in patients with portal hypertension.

The correct answer is:
C. The vascular protrusion drains into the inferior vena cava.

Rectal varices, like esophageal varices, are due to collateral circulation that develops in response to portal hypertension. They drain into the systemic circulation via the inferior vena cava, bypassing the liver. The negative fecal occult blood test does not rule out bleeding from varices, as the bleeding may not be continuous or may not be present in the stool at the time of testing.

Peptic ulcer disease (Option A) is less likely given the patient's history and the presentation of varices. Fecal leukocytes and a stool culture (Option E) are not typically required for the diagnosis of variceal bleeding. The superior rectal vein (Option B) and the inferior rectal vein (Option D) are not the correct drainage pathways for varices in this context. The superior rectal vein is part of the portal venous system, and the inferior rectal vein drains into the internal iliac vein, which is part of the systemic circulation but not the route taken by rectal varices in portal hypertension.",Success

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism. The elevated calcium (hypercalcemia) and PTH (parathyroid hormone) levels, along with the imaging findings of subperiosteal resorption and osteoporosis, suggest an overactive parathyroid gland, most commonly due to a benign adenoma.

The patient's history of several periods of depressed mood, which do not coincide with specific life events and resolve after 4-6 weeks, and occasional episodes of elevated mood with increased productivity, reduced need for sleep, and occurring over the past ten years, aligns with the diagnostic criteria for Bipolar II disorder. The absence of full-blown manic episodes, which are required for a diagnosis of Bipolar I disorder, supports the diagnosis of Bipolar II disorder. The patient's ability to enjoy spending time with her family during depressive episodes, although at times she is distressed and cannot enjoy it, is also consistent with the diagnosis of Bipolar II disorder.

None of the options A, B, C, or D are expected to be increased or decreased in a positive manner in the elderly. However, among the given options, the one that could be expected to change in the elderly is:

E. Decreased A-a gradient

This might seem counterintuitive, as one might expect the A-a gradient to increase with age due to potential alveolar-capillary membrane thickening or reduced alveolar perfusion. However, in a healthy, physically active elderly individual, the A-a gradient might not necessarily be increased and could even be decreased due to the individual's physical activity and overall health status. It's important to note that this option is the least incorrect choice among the given options, as the A-a gradient can be influenced by various factors, and a decreased gradient might not be a typical or expected change in healthy aging.

"A 3-year-old boy presents with episodic diarrhea with malodorous stools, stunted growth, occasional abdominal cramps, and an itchy rash. His mother says that these symptoms developed approximately 2 years ago. The patient was exclusively breastfed up to the age of 7 months. Supplementary feeding was started with non-starchy vegetable followed by starchy vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, and bread. Bread and cookies were the last product to be introduced at the age of 12 months.

Villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy. The patient's symptoms and the positive results for anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies suggest a diagnosis of celiac disease. Celiac disease is characterized by an immune-mediated response to gluten, leading to villous atrophy in the small intestine. This results in malabsorption, which can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, malodorous stools, stunted growth, abdominal cramps, and an itchy rash (dermatitis herpetiformis). Crypt hypertrophy is also a characteristic finding in celiac disease.",Success

Avoidant personality disorder. This disorder is characterized by feelings of extreme shyness, fear of rejection, and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of inadequacy and sensitivity to criticism. The daughter’s reluctance to take a higher-paying job as a cashier, her lack of participation in extracurricular activities, and her reaction to her mother’s suggestion to invite friends over all suggest a pattern of avoidance due to fear of rejection and social anxiety.",Success

The lesions turn white on application of 3% acetic acid. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?,E,"The most likely answer to have prevented this patient's condition is:

E. Vaccination

The description of the lesions suggests a diagnosis of genital warts, which are caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Vaccination against HPV is known to prevent the development of genital warts and is recommended for adolescents and young adults before they become sexually active. Condom use (option A) can reduce the risk of transmission but is not as effective as vaccination in preventing HPV infection.

Abdominal ultrasonography shows an enlarged liver. A biopsy of the liver shows massive centrilobular necrosis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?""",D,"The most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is B. Virus-mediated hepatocellular injury. The patient's symptoms of fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain, along with the laboratory findings of elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase 760 U/L), jaundice (elevated bilirubin levels), and the presence of massive centrilobular necrosis on liver biopsy, are all consistent with acute viral hepatitis.

The positive Anti-HAV IgG and negative Anti-HAV IgM suggest a past infection with Hepatitis A virus rather than an acute one, as IgM antibodies are typically the first to appear in an acute infection. The positive Anti-HBs and negative HBsAg indicate immunity to Hepatitis B, likely from vaccination or a past infection, and the negative Anti-HCV antibodies rule out acute Hepatitis C.

The recent travel to Guatemala and the emergency appendectomy with blood transfusion could have exposed her to various pathogens, including those that cause viral hepatitis. However, the specific virus causing the current hepatitis cannot be definitively identified from the given information alone. Further testing would be necessary to determine if it's a reactivation of a past infection or a new viral infection not covered by the initial tests.",Success

Among the options given, the most likely clinical sign to be present in this patient would be:

D. Positive Adson test

A positive Adson test indicates compression of the subclavian artery or vein as the neck is rotated and extended, which can be associated with a mass in the thoracic inlet or middle lobe of the lung, such as in Pancoast's tumor or other lung masses that can cause superior vena cava syndrome or subclavian artery compression.

The other options are less likely to be associated with the described clinical scenario:

A. Bilateral pedal edema is typically associated with heart failure, renal disease, or venous insufficiency.
B. Distended veins over the lower abdomen are not typically associated with lung masses.
C. Papilledema is associated with increased intracranial pressure and is not typically seen in lung disease.
E. Sensory loss over the ulnar aspect of the right forearm and right hand could indicate a peripheral nerve issue or compression, but is not directly related to a lung mass.

After extensive conversations with her physician and counseling, she decides she wants to medically abort her 6-week pregnancy. Which of the following drugs should be administered to this patient for this purpose?",D,"The correct answer is D. Mifepristone.

Mifepristone is a medication used for medical abortion, which is the non-surgical termination of an early pregnancy. It is typically used in combination with another medication, such as misoprostol, to complete the abortion process. Mifepristone works by blocking the hormone progesterone, which is necessary for the continuation of pregnancy. Without progesterone, the lining of the uterus breaks down, and the pregnancy cannot continue. Misoprostol then causes the uterus to contract and expel the pregnancy tissue.

Which of the following is the best next step for this patient’s menstrual cramps?",D,"The best next step for this patient's menstrual cramps is D. NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs). NSAIDs can help reduce the production of prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances that cause the uterus to contract and can lead to menstrual cramps.

While further investigation may be warranted if the pain does not respond to NSAIDs or if there are other concerning symptoms, the initial management for primary dysmenorrhea, which is what this patient appears to have, typically includes over-the-counter pain relief such as NSAIDs. Options A, B, C, and E may not be necessary at this stage unless there are additional symptoms or signs that suggest a secondary cause for the dysmenorrhea, such as endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease. Given the patient's history of heavy periods and family history of endometriosis, a pelvic ultrasound (Option B) could be considered if NSAIDs are not effective or if symptoms persist, as it can help identify structural abnormalities or other causes of pain.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death?",E,"The most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death in this scenario would be:

A. Electroencephalography (EEG)

However, it is important to note that the diagnosis of brain death is a clinical diagnosis that requires a comprehensive neurological examination and confirmation of the absence of brainstem reflexes, including the absence of a cough reflex, gag reflex, oculocephalic reflex (doll's eyes), corneal reflex, and pupillary response. Additionally, apnea testing is typically performed to confirm the lack of respiratory drive. Ancillary tests such as EEG, which should show an isoelectric (flat) pattern, can be used to support the diagnosis of brain death but are not always required. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can also be used to demonstrate the absence of cerebral blood flow, but it is not typically the first choice for confirming brain death.

In this case, since the patient's pupils are already noted to be dilated and non-reactive, and she is unresponsive to noxious stimuli, some of the initial steps in the clinical examination have already been met. The next steps would include confirming the lack of other brainstem reflexes and performing apnea testing, in addition to considering ancillary tests such as EEG or transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to support the diagnosis.",Success

Which of the following virulence factors was most likely involved in the initial step of this patient's infection?",C,"The virulence factor most likely involved in the initial step of this patient's infection is C. Adhesive pili. The adhesive pili (also known as fimbriae) are hair-like appendages on the surface of bacteria that allow them to adhere to host cells, which is a crucial step in the colonization and infection process.

The other options are also virulence factors, but they are not as directly involved in the initial attachment and colonization process:
A. Protein A is a surface protein found in Staphylococcus aureus that binds to human immunoglobulin and is not relevant to the described infection.
B. Lipooligosaccharides are components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that can trigger an inflammatory response but are not primarily involved in initial attachment.
D. Biofilm formation is a mechanism by which bacteria can adhere to surfaces and form a protective community, but it is not the initial step in infection.

""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA). ANOVA is used to determine if there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent (unrelated) groups. In this case, it would be used to compare the mean changes in the measurements between the pulmharkimab 75 mg/day group, the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group, and the placebo group.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent episodes of heart palpitations for 3 weeks. The palpitations are accompanied by chest pain that is sharp and localized to the left 3rd intercostal space. The patient does not smoke. She drinks one to two glasses of wine on the weekends. She appears nervous. Her pulse is 110/min and irregularly irregular, and blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg. Examination shows a fine tremor on both hands and digital swelling. There is retraction of the left upper eyelid. A systolic ejection murmur is heard along the right upper sternal border. The extremities are warm, and pulses are 2+ bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",A,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, which can cause palpitations, chest pain, tremor, and a systolic ejection murmur. The retraction of the left upper eyelid is also consistent with thyroid eye disease, which can occur in hyperthyroidism. The patient's tachycardia and irregularly irregular pulse are also indicative of atrial fibrillation, which can occur in hyperthyroidism.

The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be a beta-blocker, such as propranolol (Option A). Beta-blockers can help control the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as palpitations and tremor, and can also help control the heart rate in atrial fibrillation. They are often used as first-line therapy in hyperthyroidism.

Options B, C, D, and E are not as appropriate for this patient. Digoxin (Option B) can be used to control heart rate in atrial fibrillation, but it is not as effective as beta-blockers and can have significant side effects. Amiodarone (Option C) is an antiarrhythmic medication that can be used to treat atrial fibrillation, but it can also have significant side effects and is not typically used as first-line therapy. Warfarin (Option D) is an anticoagulant that can be used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, but it does not address the underlying cause of the atrial fibrillation. Diltiazem (Option E) is a calcium channel blocker that can be used to control heart rate in atrial fibrillation, but it is not as effective as beta-blockers and can have significant side effects.",Success
A 78-year-old right-handed man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for sudden onset speech changes. The patient lives with his daughter and was chatting with her when suddenly his speech became distorted with random and disconnected words that made no sense. He seems to be physically frustrated that no one understands him. Physical examination demonstrates weakness of the right arm. Damage to which location would best explain this patient’s symptoms?,A,"The patient's symptoms, which include speech changes and weakness in the right arm, are indicative of damage to the left side of the brain, as the left hemisphere controls speech and language for most people and the right side of the body. Among the options provided, damage to the left internal capsule (Option B) would best explain the patient's symptoms. The internal capsule is a structure that contains a large number of axons that connect the cerebral cortex to the brainstem and spinal cord. Damage to the left internal capsule can result in weakness on the right side of the body (hemiparesis) and speech difficulties due to its proximity to and connection with language centers in the left hemisphere. However, it is important to note that the specific location of the damage could also potentially involve the left frontal lobe (Option A), which is responsible for motor function and speech production (Broca's area). Given the description of the symptoms, both options A and B are plausible, but damage to the left internal capsule is more likely to cause both the speech changes and the right arm weakness simultaneously.",Success
"A 68-year-old woman presents with an intermittent throbbing headache with an onset approximately 3 weeks ago. The pain is bilateral, “band-like,” and extends to the neck. The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). The physical examination reveals S2 accentuation that is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border. Palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless. The neurologic exam shows no focal symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism underlying the patient’s headaches?",E,"The most likely mechanism underlying the patient’s headaches is C. Pressure created by the content of the paranasal sinuses. The patient's history of a recent upper respiratory infection, along with the description of her headache worsening with coughing or laughing, suggests a sinus headache. The lack of neurological symptoms and the absence of meningeal signs also argue against more serious intracranial causes such as a subdural hematoma, vessel dissection, or a growing neoplasm. The headache's relationship to her recent illness and the absence of other red flag symptoms make sinus pressure a more probable diagnosis.",Success
"A 31-year-old male comes to your office for his annual exam. He states that he received all of his recommended vaccinations prior to beginning college, but has not had any vaccines in the past 13 years. His medical history is significant for intermittent, exercise-induced asthma. He has been sexually active in the past with multiple female partners. In addition to an influenza vaccine, which vaccine should be administered to this patient during this visit?",C,"The correct answer is C. Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis booster (Tdap) vaccine.

Explanation: The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults every 10 years, and it can be given at any time, regardless of when the patient received the last tetanus or diphtheria-containing vaccine as an adult. Since this patient has not had any vaccines in the past 13 years, he is due for a Tdap booster. This vaccine is particularly important for adults who have close contact with infants, as pertussis (whooping cough) can be severe and even fatal in young infants. The Tdap vaccine also protects against tetanus, which can cause painful muscle contractions and stiffness, and diphtheria, which can cause a thick covering in the back of the throat that can lead to breathing problems, heart failure, and nerve damage.

While options A, B, D, and E may be appropriate for certain populations or under specific circumstances, they are not the most appropriate choices for this patient based on the information provided. The pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for adults over 65 years of age or for those with certain medical conditions, such as asthma, but it is not indicated for this patient at this time. The meningococcal vaccine is recommended for adolescents and young adults, particularly those attending college or living in dormitories, but it is not a routine vaccine for adults who are not in these high-risk groups. The Haemophilus influenza B (HIB) vaccine is typically given to infants and young children, and it is not recommended for adults. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for adolescents and young adults up to age 26, and it may be given to adults up to age 45 who were not previously vaccinated, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient based on the information provided.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 2-week history of a foot ulcer. She says that she punctured her foot with a rusty nail while she was playing tennis and that the puncture wound has since progressed to a non-healing ulcer. Over the last 2 days, she has also been experiencing a fever and drainage from the wound. On presentation, she is found to have a slightly fruity smelling red ulcer with purulent drainage. Probing the ulcer goes all the way down to bone. Which of the following characteristics is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a Gram-positive cocci in clusters (Option E). This presentation is consistent with an infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which is a Gram-positive coccus that typically appears in clusters. Staphylococcus aureus can cause deep, necrotic ulcers, especially when the infection reaches the bone (osteomyelitis), and is known to produce a fruity smell due to the production of volatile fatty acids. The purulent drainage and fever also support the diagnosis of a bacterial infection, with Staphylococcus aureus being a common culprit in such cases.",Success
"A 23-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of anorexia, nausea, upper abdominal pain, and dark-colored urine. He recently returned from a trip to Belize. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F). Physical examination shows scleral icterus and tender hepatomegaly. Serum studies show markedly elevated transaminases and anti-hepatitis A virus antibodies. In this patient, infected cells express more MHC class I molecules on their surfaces. This cellular event is primarily induced by a molecule that is also responsible for which of the following changes?",E,"The molecule that is responsible for upregulating MHC class I molecules on the surfaces of infected cells is interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). This cytokine is primarily produced by activated T cells and natural killer (NK) cells and plays a crucial role in the immune response against viral infections. Among the options provided, the most directly associated change with IFN-γ is:

C. Differentiation of T cells into TH1 cells

IFN-γ is a key cytokine in the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into TH1 cells, which are important for cell-mediated immunity against intracellular pathogens, including viruses. This differentiation process is crucial for mounting an effective immune response against the hepatitis A virus infection described in the patient.

While IFN-γ can also have other effects such as enhancing macrophage phagocytic function (option B) and activation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (option D), the most specific and relevant change in the context of the patient's condition is the differentiation of T cells into TH1 cells. Options A and E are not directly related to the actions of IFN-γ.",Success
A 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressive fatigue and shortness of breath for 1 month. He has been unable to practice with his recreational soccer team and has had to rest frequently when walking to work. His only medication is ibuprofen for joint pain. Physical examination shows tanned skin. There is tenderness to palpation and stiffness of the metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands. Pulmonary examination shows coarse crackles in both lung fields. The liver is palpated 4 cm below the right costal margin. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing is most likely to be positive for which of the following?,E,"The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with extra-articular manifestations, such as interstitial lung disease and hepatic involvement. The presence of joint pain, stiffness, and tenderness, particularly in the metacarpophalangeal joints, is characteristic of RA. The coarse crackles in both lung fields and the enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) are also consistent with systemic involvement often seen in RA.

Among the HLA types listed, HLA-DR4 is most strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C. HLA-DR4

HLA-DR4 is a genetic marker that is found in a significant percentage of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, particularly those with severe disease and extra-articular manifestations. However, it's important to note that while the presence of HLA-DR4 can increase the risk of developing RA, not all individuals with this marker will develop the disease, and not all patients with RA will test positive for HLA-DR4.",Success
"A 32-year-old Caucasian woman is referred to a gastroenterologist by her family physician for 8 months of abdominal pain, foul-smelling diarrhea with floating, bulky stools, weight loss, and macrocytic anemia. Her personal history is relevant for allergic rhinitis. Physical examination shows grouped, erythematous papulovesicular lesions on her arms, torso, and abdomen. Which of the following is the most appropriate approach for the management of this patient?",D,"The most appropriate approach for the management of this patient is D. Gluten-free diet. The symptoms described, including abdominal pain, foul-smelling diarrhea with floating, bulky stools, weight loss, macrocytic anemia, and the presence of grouped, erythematous papulovesicular lesions on her skin, are consistent with celiac disease.

"A 62-year-old woman with small-cell lung cancer comes to the physician because of a painful, burning red rash on her face and hands that developed 30 minutes after going outside to do garden work. She wore a long-sleeved shirt and was exposed to direct sunlight for about 10 minutes. The patient is light-skinned and has a history of occasional sunburns when she does not apply sunscreen. Current medications include demeclocycline for malignancy-associated hyponatremia and amoxicillin for sinusitis. Physical examination shows prominent erythema and a papular eruption on her forehead, cheeks, neck, and the dorsum of both hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",E,"The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is A. Degranulation of presensitized mast cells. This scenario is consistent with a photoallergic reaction, which can be triggered by certain medications when exposed to sunlight. Demeclocycline, which the patient is taking for malignancy-associated hyponatremia, is known to cause photosensitivity reactions. When the patient was exposed to sunlight, it likely triggered the degranulation of presensitized mast cells, leading to the erythema and papular eruption observed on sun-exposed areas of her skin.",Success
"A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he was found outside in the middle of a blizzard. On presentation, he is conscious but does not know where he is nor how he got there. His wife is contacted and says that he has been getting increasingly confused over the past 6 weeks. This progressed from misplacing objects to getting lost in places that he knew how to navigate previously. Most worryingly, he has recently started forgetting the names of their children. In addition to these memory changes, she says that he now has rapid jerky movements of his extremities as well as coordination and balance problems. Finally, he has become extremely paranoid about government surveillance and has had hallucinations about secret agents in their house. His previous medical history is significant for a previous car crash in which the patient required internal fixation of a femur fracture and a corneal transplant for corneal degeneration. Otherwise he had no neurologic deficits prior to 6 weeks ago. Physical exam reveals myoclonus and ataxia. Which of the following is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is a prion disease, specifically Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Prion diseases are caused by misfolded proteins that can induce other proteins to misfold, leading to a chain reaction and the formation of aggregates that are toxic to brain cells. This results in rapid neurological deterioration, including memory loss, cognitive impairment, myoclonus, ataxia, and psychiatric symptoms such as paranoia and hallucinations.

Given the patient's symptoms and the rapid progression of his condition, option E is the most accurate statement. Prion diseases do lead to intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, although it's important to note that tau protein aggregation is also a hallmark of other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. However, the combination of symptoms and the rapid progression are more indicative of a prion disease.

Option A is also relevant to prion diseases, as prions can indeed be transmitted on medical equipment even after autoclaving instruments. However, since the question asks for the statement that is true of the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms, option E is the most directly related to the pathophysiology of prion diseases.

Options B, C, and D are not true of prion diseases. Prions do not contain genetic material and do not require a host to survive, as they are misfolded proteins. They do not have a cell wall containing peptidoglycan, as they are not bacteria. Lastly, prion diseases are not associated with longstanding hypertension.",Success
"A 5-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician due to sore throat and fever. He was in his usual state of health until 3 days ago when he began to complain of a sore throat as well as general malaise. The patient's past medical history reveals recurrent upper respiratory infections but no skin or soft tissue infections. The child had cardiac surgery as an infant but has otherwise been healthy. On presentation, his temperature is 100°F (37.8 °C), blood pressure is 115/72 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 22/min. Physical exam shows white plaques on the tongue and mouth. A scraping of this material reveals a characteristic morphology after being treated with KOH. Serum protein electrophoresis shows a normal distribution of bands from this patient. Which of the following findings would most likely be found in this patient?",C,"The characteristic morphology after treating the scraping material with KOH suggests the presence of fungal elements, most likely Candida albicans, which is a common cause of oral thrush, especially in children with a history of recurrent infections or recent antibiotic use. The other options do not correlate with the clinical presentation of the patient. Therefore, the answer is not listed among the options provided, but the most likely diagnosis based on the given information is oral thrush due to Candida infection.

However, if we must choose from the given options, none of them directly correlate with the clinical presentation. But, since the patient has a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections, which could be indicative of an underlying immunodeficiency, option A (abnormal expression of autoimmune regulator (AIRE)) could be considered. AIRE gene mutations can lead to autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, endocrine deficiencies, and autoimmune disorders.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's inability to conceive?,C,"The most likely cause of this patient's inability to conceive, based on the information provided, is C. Diminished ovarian reserve. This is because the patient is 35 years old, and her difficulty in conceiving could be due to a natural decline in the quantity and quality of her eggs as she ages. Additionally, the fact that she has had one unsuccessful attempt at in vitro fertilization (IVF) could suggest that her ovarian reserve is lower than what would be expected for her age.

A 27-year-old man and his wife come to the physician for preconception genetic counseling. The patient and his wife are asymptomatic and have no history of serious illness. The patient's older brother died at age 13 from heart failure and his 6-year-old nephew currently has severe muscle weakness. Genetic testing in the patient's family shows that his mother is not a carrier of the mutation that is responsible for the disease in his relatives. A pedigree chart of the patient's family is shown. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the patient not being affected?,C,"The most likely explanation for the patient not being affected, given the information provided, is **E. Incomplete penetrance**.

Incomplete penetrance refers to a situation where not all individuals who inherit a disease-causing mutation exhibit symptoms of the disease. This can occur due to various factors, including genetic modifiers, environmental factors, or random chance. In this case, the patient's mother is not a carrier of the mutation, which means the mutation must have been inherited from the father's side. The patient's brother and nephew are affected, but the patient himself is not, despite being at risk for inheriting the mutation. This suggests that even though he may carry the mutation, he does not exhibit symptoms, which is consistent with incomplete penetrance.

Variable expressivity (Option A) refers to differences in the severity of symptoms among individuals with the same genetic condition, which is not directly related to why the patient is not affected at all.

Maternal uniparental disomy (Option B) is a condition where an individual inherits two copies of a chromosome from one parent and none from the other, which is not relevant to the scenario described.

Gonadal mosaicism (Option C) is a situation where the mutation is present in the germ cells (sperm or eggs) but not in the somatic cells of the body, which could explain why a parent who appears unaffected can still pass on a genetic disorder, but it does not explain why the patient is unaffected.

Dominant negative mutation (Option D) refers to a mutation in a gene that not only eliminates the function of that gene but also interferes with the function of the normal copy of the gene. This typically leads to disease expression, not absence of disease, in heterozygous individuals.",Success
"A 58-year-old Caucasian female presents to her primary care physician with concerns about several recent health changes. The patient has recently gained weight and can't seem to exercise like she used to. She also notes that her thinking seems slow. Physical examination shows thickened, dry skin. Serum analysis confirms the physician's suspicions. Which of the following findings was most helpful in the diagnosis?",C,"The patient's symptoms, including weight gain, decreased exercise tolerance, slowed thinking, and thickened, dry skin, are consistent with hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, leading to a slow metabolism. The most helpful finding in diagnosing hypothyroidism would be:

B. Low T4 and T3

Additionally, in hypothyroidism, you would also expect to see:

C. High TSH

The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is produced by the pituitary gland and stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. In cases of hypothyroidism, the pituitary gland increases TSH production in an attempt to stimulate the underactive thyroid gland, resulting in high TSH levels. However, since only one answer can be the most directly diagnostic, the combination of low T4 and T3 levels would be the most definitive finding for hypothyroidism. But since the question asks for the single most helpful finding, and considering the context provided, the high TSH (Option C) would be the most indicative of primary hypothyroidism, as it reflects the body's response to low thyroid hormone levels.",Success
"A 33-year-old woman at 17-weeks gestation comes to the physician for evaluation of a painless mass in the right breast for the last 3 weeks that has not increased in size. Physical examination shows dense breasts and a 2.5-cm rubbery, mobile mass that is nontender in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast.

A. Fibroadenoma

Fibroadenomas are benign breast tumors that can occur at any age but are more common in women in their 20s and 30s. They are often firm, rubbery, and can move freely under the skin. The description of the mass and the biopsy findings are consistent with a fibroadenoma. Pregnancy can cause changes in breast tissue, but these changes are typically diffuse and not localized to a single, discrete mass. Fibrocystic changes can present with lumps, but these are usually tender and associated with premenstrual symptoms.

After reviewing his medical chart, you see also see an annotation indicating no blood transfusions for religious reasons. Knowing that he needs a blood transfusion to save his life, what do you do?",C,"In this situation, respecting the patient's autonomy and previously expressed wishes is crucial. The patient has explicitly stated in his medical chart that he refuses blood transfusions for religious reasons, and his wife confirms this. Therefore, the correct course of action is:

C. Respect the patient's written instructions and do not administer a blood transfusion.

However, this does not mean abandoning the patient. It is important to provide the best possible care within the constraints of the patient's wishes. This might involve using alternative methods to manage blood loss and maintain hemodynamic stability during surgery, such as using cell savers to recycle the patient's own blood, volume expanders, and other blood conservation techniques.

Additionally, it would be prudent to:

B. Call the ethics board of the hospital to discuss the issue

The parents of a 14-year-old patient are concerned and have questions about the use of insulin for their son’s recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes. The patient has developed an upper respiratory infection while at school. He is coughing and has a runny nose. His temperature is 37.8° C (100.2° F) and vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following modifications to his insulin regimen would you recommend to this patient and his parents?,A,"A. Increase the frequency of blood glucose checks.

When a person with diabetes gets sick, even with a mild infection like an upper respiratory infection, their blood glucose levels can become more difficult to control. This is due to the body's stress response, which can cause an increase in blood sugar. Therefore, it's important to monitor blood glucose levels more frequently to ensure they remain within a safe range. Adjustments to the insulin regimen can then be made based on the results of these checks. It's not advisable to reduce or hold insulin without close monitoring and medical advice, as this could lead to uncontrolled hyperglycemia. Increasing the insulin dose to double without medical supervision is also not recommended, as it could lead to hypoglycemia.",Success
"A researcher evaluates healthy breast tissue from 100 women, 50 women that were pregnant at the time of the study and 50 age-matched non-pregnant women.

Which process caused this change?",A,"The process that caused the change in breast tissue of pregnant women compared to non-pregnant women, characterized by an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation, is:

A. Hyperplasia

Hyperplasia is the increase in the number of cells in a tissue or organ, resulting in an enlargement of that tissue or organ.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,B,"The most appropriate next step in management for this 21-month-old boy with noted deformities in both legs since he started walking would be:

B. Reassurance and follow-up

The child's developmental milestones, including his ability to kick a ball and say a two-word phrase, are appropriate for his age. His growth parameters are also within normal limits, and he has no history of significant illness. The description of the deformities (""the knees do not stay together when both the feet and ankles are placed together"") suggests a genu valgum (knock-knees), which is common in toddlers and often resolves without intervention as the child grows. Since his gait is unremarkable and he plays well with other children, there is no immediate indication of a serious underlying condition. Regular follow-up to monitor the progression of his leg alignment and overall growth is recommended.

Vitamin D supplementation (A) might be considered if there were signs of rickets or other nutritional deficiencies, but there is no indication of this in the case description. X-ray of the lower extremities (C) could be warranted if there were signs of significant deformity or if the condition does not improve with growth, but it is not the first-line action in this scenario. Bracing of the lower extremities (D) and tibial osteotomy (E) are more invasive interventions that are not indicated for a child with mild, age-appropriate leg deformities and no functional impairment.",Success
"A 30-year-old woman presents to an outpatient clinic for a scheduled gynecologic check-up. The patient appears well and has no specific complaints. She is current with her Pap smears, all of which have been normal. Her menstrual periods are regular and usually last 3–4 days. She denies any recent travel or a history of trauma. The patient has not been sexually active for the past 2 months. She smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol occasionally, but has never used illicit drugs. The pelvic examination reveals a small, firm, non-tender, immobile cystic mass at the edge of the exocervical os with a yellow hue. The patient is otherwise asymptomatic and has no other complaints. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",A,"The next best step in management would be to perform a colposcopy and biopsy (Option C). The presence of a small, firm, non-tender, immobile cystic mass at the edge of the exocervical os with a yellow hue is concerning and requires further evaluation to determine its nature. Colposcopy allows for a detailed visual examination of the cervix and surrounding areas, and a biopsy can provide tissue for histological examination to determine whether the mass is benign or malignant. This is particularly important given that the patient is a smoker, which is a risk factor for cervical cancer. Options A, B, D, and E are not indicated in the absence of a diagnosis.",Success
"A 1900-g (4-lb 3-oz) newborn is delivered at term to a 36-year-old primigravid woman. Pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios. Apgar scores are 7 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. He is at the 2nd percentile for head circumference and 15th percentile for length. Examination shows a prominent posterior part of the head. The ears are low-set and the jaw is small and retracted. The fists are clenched, with overlapping second and third fingers. The calcaneal bones are prominent and the plantar surface of the foot shows a convex deformity. Abdominal examination shows an omphalocele. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",B,"The clinical presentation described is consistent with a number of congenital anomalies, but the combination of features such as low-set ears, a small and retracted jaw (micrognathia), clenched fists with overlapping fingers, a convex foot deformity, and an omphalocele, along with the prominent posterior part of the head and small head circumference, suggests a diagnosis of Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS). However, TCS is not listed among the options provided. Given the options, we should look for the one that is most commonly associated with the described features.

A. Cataracts - Although cataracts can be present in a variety of genetic disorders, they are not the most likely finding in this case based on the given symptoms.

B. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) - A VSD is a common congenital heart defect, but it is not typically associated with the specific constellation of symptoms described.

C. Ebstein's anomaly - This is a rare heart defect characterized by displacement of the tricuspid valve, but it is not typically associated with the other symptoms described.

D. Pheochromocytoma - This is a tumor of the adrenal gland that secretes catecholamines and is not related to the described symptoms.

E. Holoprosencephaly - This is a congenital brain malformation characterized by the failure of the forebrain to properly divide into two hemispheres. It can be associated with a small head circumference and other craniofacial abnormalities, but the other symptoms described do not specifically point to holoprosencephaly.

Given the symptoms described, the most likely finding among the options provided would be B. Ventricular septal defect (VSD), as heart defects can occur in conjunction with other congenital anomalies, and a VSD is a common type of congenital heart defect that might be found in a newborn with multiple anomalies. However, it's important to note that the constellation of symptoms described is more indicative of a syndrome such as Treacher Collins syndrome, which is not listed among the options.",Success

Urinalysis shows proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells. The patient’s proteinuria best fits in which of the following category?",A,"The patient's proteinuria is most likely due to overflow proteinuria (Option A). Overflow proteinuria occurs when there is an excess of low molecular weight proteins in the blood, such as Bence Jones proteins or myoglobin, which overflow into the urine because the renal tubules cannot reabsorb them all. This type of proteinuria is often associated with conditions like multiple myeloma or rhabdomyolysis.

However, it's important to note that the given information does not provide direct evidence for overflow proteinuria, such as the presence of Bence Jones proteins. The presence of anemia, mild back pain, and the absence of other causes of proteinuria (like orthostatic proteinuria or tubular proteinuria) in the context of a 68-year-old patient might suggest a malignancy like multiple myeloma, which can cause overflow proteinuria. Further tests, such as a serum protein electrophoresis or a urine protein electrophoresis, would be necessary to confirm the type of proteinuria.",Success

Which of the following is the next best step in management for this patient's underlying condition?",E,"The patient's presentation, including her history of depression and anxiety, her odd behavior, and her non-compliance with medication, suggests a psychiatric disorder. However, the fact that she was responding to internal stimuli and her subsequent calming down and cooperation could also indicate a substance-induced psychosis or a medical condition that affects mental status. Given her history of medication non-compliance and the possibility of substance use, the next best step in management would be to rule out any acute medical or substance-induced causes for her behavior.

Option D, urine toxicology, is the most appropriate next step in this scenario. It can help identify any substances that the patient may have used, which could be contributing to her behavior and symptoms. This information is crucial for guiding further treatment and management.

If urine toxicology comes back negative and there are no other medical conditions identified, then further psychiatric evaluation and consideration of psychiatric medication management would be appropriate. Options A, B, and C are psychiatric medications, and while they may be necessary for her underlying psychiatric conditions, they are not the next best step without first ruling out medical or substance-induced causes. Option E, ANA and anti-dsDNA levels, would be relevant if there were clinical suspicion for an autoimmune disorder, but there is no information in the case to suggest this is the case.",Success
"A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of fever, abdominal pain, and rapidly progressive distension of the abdomen. His appendix was removed for an abscess 3 days ago.

Which of the following, in addition to polymicrobial infection, is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?",A,"The most likely cause of this patient's condition, in addition to a polymicrobial infection, is C. Clostridium perfringens. This bacterium is a gram-positive anaerobe that can cause gas gangrene and other severe infections, particularly in post-surgical patients or in cases of tissue trauma. The clinical presentation described (fever, abdominal pain, and rapidly progressive distension of the abdomen) is consistent with a severe intra-abdominal infection that can be caused by Clostridium perfringens. The fact that the patient recently underwent an appendectomy and has a positive anaerobic culture further supports this diagnosis. Bacteroides fragilis (option A) is also an anaerobic gram-negative pathogen that can cause intra-abdominal infections, but Clostridium perfringens is more commonly associated with the clinical presentation described.

Based on clinical suspicion, an acid fast stain is performed showing the causative organism, and she is started on appropriate therapy. Two weeks later, she returns with a skin rash, diarrhea, and confusion, and is given a factor to take in addition to the medications previously prescribed. Which of the following is a characteristic of the factor that was most likely provided?",B,"The patient's symptoms and the fact that she recently returned from traveling abroad suggest a diagnosis of tuberculosis. The acid fast stain that was performed and the appropriate therapy that was started are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's subsequent symptoms of skin rash, diarrhea, and confusion suggest a reaction to the medication used to treat tuberculosis, most likely isoniazid. Isoniazid can cause a reaction known as a ""drug fever"" and can also cause peripheral neuropathy, which can manifest as confusion. The factor that is often given in addition to isoniazid to prevent this reaction is pyridoxine (vitamin B6), which is required for transaminase enzymes, not listed in the options but closest to option E, which is required for transketolase function, but this is not the correct answer. However, the closest answer to the question would be:
C. Required for methionine processing
This is not the correct answer, but it is the closest one to the correct answer, which is vitamin B6 or pyridoxine, which is not listed in the options. Pyridoxine is a cofactor for transaminase enzymes, which are involved in amino acid metabolism, including the metabolism of methionine. However, the specific function listed in option C is not the correct one for pyridoxine. Pyridoxine is given to patients taking isoniazid to prevent peripheral neuropathy, which can occur as a side effect of isoniazid therapy.",Success
"A 51-year-old Asian woman presents to her primary care provider with abdominal pain. On examination, she is found to have rebound tenderness in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen. Further workup suggests ovarian cancer, which is confirmed later in the week to be stage 4 with confirmed distant metastases in the lungs and brain. Which of the following routes describes the most likely lymphatic route for this malignancy to have metastasized to the brain?",E,"The lymphatic drainage from the ovaries primarily follows two pathways: one through the para-aortic lymph nodes and the other through the internal iliac lymph nodes. Metastasis to the brain from ovarian cancer would not typically follow the lymphatic pathways listed in the options provided, as these options describe the pathways for lymphatic drainage from the lower extremities, which would not be the most direct route for ovarian cancer to spread to the brain.

However, if we must choose from the given options, the most likely route for lymphatic spread that could potentially lead to distant metastasis would involve the thoracic duct, as it is the major lymphatic vessel that drains into the systemic circulation. The thoracic duct drains into the left subclavian vein, which is connected to the systemic circulation and could potentially allow for the spread of cancer cells to distant organs such as the brain.

Therefore, the closest option to the correct answer would be:

B. Sentinel node - left lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation

However, it's important to note that the most common routes for ovarian cancer to metastasize to the brain are through the bloodstream or via direct spread to the abdominal cavity and then to the diaphragm, which can potentially allow for dissemination to the chest and from there to the brain through the bloodstream. Lymphatic spread to the brain from ovarian cancer is less common and not typically described through the pathways listed in the options.",Success

The structure indicated by the arrows is most likely lined by which of the following?",C,"The structure indicated by the arrows in the CT scan is most likely lined by E. Columnar mucinous epithelium. This type of epithelium is characteristic of the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach and intestines, which are common sites for symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and pain. The presence of bulky, foul-smelling stools that are difficult to flush can be indicative of malabsorption, which can occur due to various conditions affecting the gastrointestinal tract, including those involving the pancreas. The patient's history of alcohol consumption also suggests a possible role of pancreatic disease, such as chronic pancreatitis, which can affect the digestive process and lead to symptoms like those described. The columnar mucinous epithelium is responsible for secreting mucus, which helps protect the underlying tissues from digestive enzymes and acidic contents of the stomach.",Success

Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?",D,"The symptoms described in the case are consistent with social anxiety disorder, which is characterized by excessive fear of social situations where the individual may be judged by others, leading to avoidance of such situations. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for social anxiety disorder is typically a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).

Option D, Fluoxetine, is an SSRI and is commonly used to treat anxiety disorders, including social anxiety disorder. It has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of social anxiety and is often the first-line treatment due to its safety profile and efficacy.

Options A (Clomipramine), B (Phenelzine), and E (Propranolol) are not typically first-line treatments for social anxiety disorder. Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that is more commonly used for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Phenelzine is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that can be used for anxiety disorders but has a more complex interaction profile and dietary restrictions, making it less favorable as a first-line treatment. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can be used for short-term relief of anxiety symptoms, particularly physical symptoms like heart racing, but it is not typically used as a long-term treatment for social anxiety disorder.

Option C, Clonazepam, is a benzodiazepine that can be effective for anxiety but has a high potential for dependence and is not usually the first-line treatment for social anxiety disorder due to these risks.

This murmur and the associated symptoms are most consistent with a diagnosis of pulmonary stenosis. Pulmonary stenosis can be caused by a defect in the infundibular septum, which is an embryonic structure that contributes to the formation of the right ventricular outflow tract and the pulmonary valve.

Therefore, the structure that gives rise to the defective structure causing this patient's symptoms is the infundibular septum (Option C).

The other options are not directly related to the symptoms described:
A. Aortopulmonary septum - This structure is involved in the formation of the aorticopulmonary septum, which separates the aorta and pulmonary artery. Defects in this structure can lead to conditions like truncus arteriosus.

It is often associated with other atopic conditions such as asthma and eczema. The symptoms of difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and the sensation of food getting stuck (known as food impaction) are common in eosinophilic esophagitis, particularly when eating solid foods. The lack of response to high-dose proton pump inhibitors (like omeprazole) suggests that the symptoms are not primarily due to acid reflux, although reflux can coexist with eosinophilic esophagitis.

Achalasia (option A) would typically present with difficulty swallowing both solids and liquids, and regurgitation of undigested food, which is not described in this case.

Diffuse esophageal spasm (option B) typically presents with chest pain and dysphagia that can be for both solids and liquids, but it is less likely to be associated with a history of atopic conditions.

Esophageal reflux disease (option D) would likely have responded to high-dose omeprazole, and the patient's symptoms are not typical of uncomplicated reflux disease.

Schatzki’s ring (option E) can cause intermittent dysphagia, but it is usually for solids and typically does not present with the persistent symptoms described in this case, nor is it associated with atopic conditions.",Success
"A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. He was at work as a construction worker when his coworkers found him down at the work site. The patient recently underwent anesthesia for an appendectomy several months ago. He also has a past medical history of schizophrenia well controlled with haloperidol and is currently taking phenytoin for epilepsy. He is also currently taking propranolol for anxiety and hyperthyroidism. His temperature is 106°F (41.1°C), blood pressure is 109/62 mmHg, pulse is 170/min, respirations are 23/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an altered man with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 10. He has minimal muscle tone and is incoherent when answering questions. The patient is covered in sweat and dirt. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The most likely diagnosis in this scenario is B. Malignant hyperthermia. The patient's high fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status are consistent with this diagnosis. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare but life-threatening condition that can occur in susceptible individuals, often triggered by certain anesthetic agents or stress. The patient's history of recent anesthesia and current medications (haloperidol and propranolol) increase the suspicion for malignant hyperthermia. However, it is important to rule out other potential causes such as status epilepticus, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and thyroid storm, which can also present with similar symptoms. Immediate cooling measures and administration of dantrolene are critical in managing malignant hyperthermia.",Success
"A 67-year-old man is brought to the hospital by his relatives. He complains of early satiety, abdominal discomfort after food intake, and abdominal bloating. These symptoms have been present since the patient was 52, but they were milder at that time so he paid little attention to them since. Tingling and decreased sensation in both lower extremities began a few months ago. His relatives also note that he has become excessively somnolent and forgetful. The patient’s medical history is significant for acute hepatitis B 20 years ago. He smokes a pack of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol occasionally. His weight is 61 kg (134.5 lb), height is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in), and BMI is 18.6 kg/m2. His vital signs include: blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate 89/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.1°C (96.9°F). The patient’s skin is pale, thin, dry, and hypoelastic. Lymph nodes and the thyroid gland are not enlarged. Lung and heart examinations are within normal limits for his age. The patient’s tongue is bright red with atrophic papillae. The abdomen is distended and tender to palpation in the epigastric area. Neurological examination shows symmetrical bilateral distal hypoesthesia for all sensations and decreased muscle strength in both upper and lower extremities.

Which of the following options best explains the patient’s neurological and psychiatric symptoms?",D,"The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are most consistent with a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency, which is reflected in the option D: Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms such as distal hypoesthesia, decreased muscle strength, and cognitive impairment due to its role in myelin synthesis and maintenance. The patient's blood test results show a macrocytic anemia, which is a hallmark of vitamin B12 deficiency, with an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). The low reticulocyte count also supports this diagnosis, as vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to a decreased production of red blood cells. The patient's history of smoking, alcohol use, and hepatitis B may contribute to his vitamin B12 deficiency, as these factors can affect absorption and metabolism of the vitamin.",Success
"A four-day-old neonate is brought to the pediatrician with vaginal discharge for the last two days. Her mother is concerned about the blood-tinged discharge but states that her daughter has been feeding and voiding well. The neonate was delivered at 39 weeks gestation by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, and she and her mother were discharged home after two days. The prenatal course was complicated by chlamydia in the mother during the first trimester, for which she and the partner were both treated with a negative test of cure. The neonate’s biological father is no longer involved the patient's care, but her mother’s boyfriend has been caring for the baby whenever the mother rests. At this visit, the neonate’s temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), pulse is 138/min, and respirations are 51/min. She appears comfortable, and cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. There are no bruises or marks on her skin. Examination of the genitals reveals no vulvar irritation or skin changes, but there is scant pink mucoid discharge at the introitus. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",E,"The best next step in management for a four-day-old neonate with vaginal discharge is to perform a vaginal culture (Option C). The blood-tinged discharge could be due to a variety of causes, including infection, hormonal changes, or trauma. Given the mother's history of chlamydia during pregnancy, there is a possibility that the neonate could have been exposed to the infection during delivery. Performing a vaginal culture will help identify any potential pathogens and guide appropriate treatment. Reassurance (Option E) might be appropriate after obtaining the culture results and confirming there is no serious underlying condition. The other options (A, B, and D) are not indicated at this stage without further evidence or concern.",Success
"A 53-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of fatigue and joint and muscle pain. He reports a 6-month history of slowly progressive tiredness associated with dull achy pain in his knees, hips, and shoulders. His past medical history is notable for hypertension, diabetes, and stable angina. He takes lisinopril, metformin, glyburide, and aspirin. He has a history of intravenous drug use and was homeless in his early 30’s. He drinks alcohol socially and has a 30 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination reveals a generally well-appearing male without evidence of ascites, peripheral edema, or jaundice. Results from laboratory tests are below:

Hepatitis A IgM: Negative
Hepatitis A IgG: Negative
Hepatitis B surface antigen: Negative
Hepatitis B E antigen: Negative

Hepatitis B surface IgG: Positive
Hepatitis B E IgG: Negative
Hepatitis B core IgG: Negative
Hepatitis C IgG: Positive
HCV RNA: 100,000,000 IU/ml

This patient should be started on which of the following medications?",A,"Given the patient's positive HCV IgG and high HCV RNA levels, he has a chronic Hepatitis C infection. The current standard of care for treating Hepatitis C is direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), which have high cure rates and fewer side effects compared to older treatments such as interferon-alpha.

Option A, Sofosbuvir and simeprevir, is a combination of DAAs that can be used to treat Hepatitis C. However, simeprevir is a protease inhibitor and is typically used in combination with other antivirals, not just sofosbuvir. The specific regimen would depend on the genotype of the Hepatitis C virus, which is not provided in the question.

Options B, C, and E are not the recommended treatments for Hepatitis C. Interferon-alpha (option B) and interferon-gamma (option C) are not used in the current treatment protocols for Hepatitis C. Ribavirin (option D) is sometimes used in combination with DAAs, but it is not used as a monotherapy.

Option E, Lamivudine, is an antiviral medication used to treat HIV and Hepatitis B, not Hepatitis C.

The correct answer is A. Sofosbuvir and simeprevir, although it should be noted that the specific combination of DAAs prescribed would depend on the patient's Hepatitis C genotype and other factors, and simeprevir is not typically paired with sofosbuvir alone. A more current regimen might include sofosbuvir with velpatasvir or another DAA, depending on the patient's specific circumstances.",Success
"A 40-year-old woman presents to her family physician with a 3-week history of swollen neck. The small, round, and painless swelling, which was detected 3 weeks ago in the middle of her neck, has now increased in size. The swelling is associated with sweaty palms and soles, insomnia, irritability, nervousness, and fatigue; however, the patient does not complain of fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, weight loss, vision problems, or body swelling. The patient’s medical history is negative for similar symptoms or a thyroid disorder. The vital signs are within normal limits. Local examination reveals a 3 x 3 cm round, non-tender, non-fluctuant, and non-pulsatile swelling in the anterior triangle of her neck. The patient carries a total white blood cell count of 10,200/mm3, including 70% neutrophils, 30% lymphocytes, and zero eosinophils.The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 20 mm/hr (normal, 0–29 mm/hr). What is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The most likely diagnosis for the 40-year-old woman presenting with a 3-week history of a swollen neck, along with symptoms of sweaty palms and soles, insomnia, irritability, nervousness, and fatigue, is A. Graves' disease. However, it's important to note that the definitive diagnosis would require further testing, such as thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4, and free T3 levels), thyroid antibodies, and possibly a thyroid scan or ultrasound.

Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that leads to overactivity of the thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). The symptoms described by the patient, including the presence of a non-tender, non-fluctuant, and non-pulsatile swelling in the anterior triangle of her neck, are consistent with a goiter (enlargement of the thyroid gland) often seen in Graves' disease. The symptoms of sweaty palms and soles, insomnia, irritability, nervousness, and fatigue are also typical of hyperthyroidism.

The other options provided do not fit the clinical presentation as well as Graves' disease:

B. De Quervain’s thyroiditis is an acute form of thyroiditis characterized by a painful, tender thyroid gland and can be associated with fever and elevated inflammatory markers, which are not present in this patient.

C. Silent thyroiditis is a form of thyroiditis that typically presents with a transient period of hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism, often without symptoms. It is not typically associated with a significant goiter or the symptoms described by the patient.

D. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is a chronic autoimmune thyroiditis characterized by a diffusely enlarged, often tender, and firm thyroid gland. It typically presents with hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism and does not usually present with the symptoms of hyperthyroidism described by the patient.

E. Riedel's thyroiditis is a rare form of chronic thyroiditis characterized by extensive fibrosis of the thyroid gland, often leading to a hard, fixed, and enlarged thyroid gland. It is not typically associated with the symptoms of hyperthyroidism described by the patient.

Therefore, based on the provided history and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is A. Graves' disease. However, further diagnostic tests are necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",Success

This test is highly specific for rheumatoid arthritis, a condition that can present with symptoms such as joint pain, stiffness, and erythema. The presence of anti-CCP antibodies in the blood can help confirm the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, especially when combined with clinical symptoms and physical examination findings. While other tests such as rheumatoid factor (option C) may also be helpful, anti-CCP antibodies are more specific for rheumatoid arthritis and are therefore a better choice for this patient.",Success
"A 66-year-old man comes to the physician because of fatigue and swelling of his legs and feet for 6 weeks.

Ultrasound of the liver and kidneys shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?""",D,"The most likely cause of this patient's findings is C. Renal deposition of AL amyloid. The symptoms described, including fatigue, swelling of the legs and feet, periorbital edema, and frothy urine, along with laboratory findings such as hypoalbuminemia (low albumin levels) and proteinuria (protein in the urine), are consistent with nephrotic syndrome. This condition can be caused by amyloidosis, particularly AL amyloidosis, which is associated with multiple myeloma or other plasma cell dyscrasias. The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and chronic alcohol abuse are also risk factors for developing amyloidosis. The absence of significant liver dysfunction (as indicated by normal AST and ALT levels) and the lack of abnormalities on ultrasound of the liver and kidneys further support a diagnosis of amyloidosis over other options such as liver disease or renal inflammation due to anti-dsDNA immune complexes.",Success

The patient's cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. The patient is breathing on his own and has strong distal pulses. Ultimately, the patient is discharged with follow up instructions after no significant fractures or injuries are found. The patient then presents 4 months later to his primary doctor with weakness. The patient's strength in his upper extremities is 1/5. He has reduced sensation in his upper extremities as well. The patient's lower extremities reveal 5/5 strength with intact sensation. A chest radiograph and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"Based on the patient's symptoms of weakness and reduced sensation in the upper extremities with normal strength and sensation in the lower extremities, the most likely diagnosis is a cervical spine injury. However, since the patient was discharged after the accident with no significant fractures or injuries found, a delayed presentation of a cervical spine fracture might be less likely. The other options can be considered as well, but given the symptoms and the history of trauma, the most plausible diagnosis would be:

A. Cervical spine fracture (though less likely due to the initial negative findings)
C. Syringomyelia
D. Brachial plexopathy

Syringomyelia is a disorder in which a cyst or fluid-filled cavity forms within the spinal cord, often as a result of injury or disease, which can lead to symptoms like weakness and sensory loss in the upper extremities. Brachial plexopathy involves damage to the brachial plexus, the network of nerves that sends signals from the spinal cord to the shoulder, arm, and hand, which can also result in weakness and sensory loss in the upper extremities.

Given the information provided, without further diagnostic tests, it's difficult to definitively determine the diagnosis. However, based on the symptoms described, options C and D are the most relevant. Since the question asks for the most likely diagnosis, and considering the patient's history of trauma, option D, Brachial plexopathy, might be considered the most likely diagnosis due to its direct association with trauma. However, Syringomyelia (option C) could also develop as a late complication of a spinal cord injury and should not be ruled out without appropriate imaging.",Success

Renal duplex ultrasonography shows 90% occlusion of the right renal artery. Decreased renal blood flow is most likely to cause which of the following?",A,"The decreased renal blood flow, as suggested by the 90% occlusion of the right renal artery, is most likely to cause hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells (Option A). This is because the juxtaglomerular cells, which are located in the walls of the afferent arterioles of the kidney, are sensitive to changes in blood flow and pressure. When blood flow is decreased, these cells are stimulated to release renin, a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The activation of this system helps to maintain blood pressure by promoting vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention. In response to decreased blood flow, the juxtaglomerular cells may undergo hyperplasia, increasing the number of cells and enhancing the release of renin.",Success

During which of the following developmental stages does a T cell undergo this process?",C,"The process of positive selection occurs during the development of T cells when they are in the double-positive stage. This is when T cells express both CD4 and CD8 co-receptors on their surface and are referred to as double-positive T cells. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C. Double-positive T cell

During this stage, T cells are tested for their ability to recognize self-MHC molecules. Those that can bind to self-MHC class I molecules will develop into CD8+ T cells, while those that bind to self-MHC class II molecules will become CD4+ T cells. This process ensures that T cells are capable of recognizing antigens presented by self-MHC molecules, which is essential for their proper function in the immune system.",Success
"A 28-year-old male presents with a recent onset of upsetting dreams, anxiety, and disturbing flashbacks. The patient reports that he returned from active duty in Iraq 3 months ago and was adjusting to life back at home until about 7 weeks ago when he began having intense fear of loud noises and seeing sudden flashbacks to bombing attacks he endured during his time in Iraq. He had to take a leave from his army instructor duties as he was not able to handle the familiar settings of practice shooting ranges and sudden loud explosions during battalion training. After refusing to leave his house, he was finally persuaded by his wife to visit your clinic. What is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The most likely diagnosis for the 28-year-old male based on the symptoms and history provided is:

D. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

PTSD is characterized by symptoms such as upsetting dreams, anxiety, disturbing flashbacks, and intense fear triggered by reminders of a traumatic event, which in this case is his experience in Iraq. The onset of these symptoms began after his return from active duty and has significantly impacted his ability to function in daily life and work. His reaction to loud noises and avoidance of certain settings are also indicative of PTSD.",Success
"A patient with a1-antitrypsin deficiency is warned by his physician that his increasing dyspnea may be worsened by his continued cigarette smoking. Which of the following factors, released by both neutrophils and alveolar macrophages, is responsible for the patient's condition?",E,"The factor responsible for the patient's condition, which is released by both neutrophils and alveolar macrophages, is Elastase (Option E). Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency leads to an imbalance between proteases and antiproteases in the lungs. Elastase is a protease that breaks down elastin in the lung tissue. In individuals with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, there is not enough of this protein to inhibit elastase, leading to lung tissue damage and conditions such as emphysema. Smoking can exacerbate this condition as it increases the release of elastase and other proteases.",Success

At the emergency department, she is alert and oriented and is noted to be anorexic. The patient fervently denies being underweight claiming that she is ‘a fatty’ and goes on to refuse any further intravenous fluid and later, even the hospital meals. Which of the following is the best option for long-term management of this patient’s condition?",A,"The patient's presentation suggests a possible diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, characterized by her refusal to maintain a normal body weight, distorted body image, and refusal of food and fluids. Her hypotension and bradycardia could be due to dehydration and malnutrition. The best option for long-term management of her condition would be a comprehensive treatment plan that includes both medical and psychiatric care.

Option C, in-patient psychiatric therapy, is the most appropriate choice given the severity of her symptoms and her resistance to treatment. This would allow for close monitoring of her medical and psychiatric status, provision of nutritional support, and initiation of psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (Option A), to address her distorted body image and eating behaviors. Antidepressants (Option D) may also be considered as part of the treatment plan, but they are not typically used as a standalone treatment for anorexia nervosa. Appetite stimulants (Option E) are not typically used in the treatment of anorexia nervosa and would not address the underlying psychological issues. In-patient medical therapy (Option B) is also important, but it is not sufficient on its own to address the complex psychological and behavioral aspects of anorexia nervosa.",Success
A 45-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He was diagnosed with HIV 15 years ago. He was taking triple antiretroviral therapy but stopped a few months ago because he was feeling well. He lives in Wyoming. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 47/mm3 (N ≥ 500). The patient currently refuses to restart antiretroviral therapy. Which of the following medication regimens is most appropriate at this time?,D,"Given the patient's low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 47/mm3, which is significantly below the normal range of ≥500/mm3, the patient is at high risk for opportunistic infections. Despite his refusal to restart antiretroviral therapy, it is crucial to address the immediate risk of infections that he faces due to his immunocompromised state. Among the options provided, the most appropriate prophylactic regimen to prevent opportunistic infections in this scenario is:

A. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole

Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is commonly used as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), which is a significant opportunistic infection in HIV-positive patients with low CD4 counts. It is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for HIV-infected patients with a CD4 count below 200/mm3, but given this patient's extremely low CD4 count, it is even more critical. The other medications listed (azithromycin, itraconazole, amphotericin B, dapsone, and pyrimethamine) are also used for prophylaxis or treatment of specific opportunistic infections, but TMP-SMX is the most broadly protective and indicated in this case.

However, it is important to note that the patient's refusal to restart antiretroviral therapy is concerning and should be addressed. Antiretroviral therapy is essential for managing HIV and improving the patient's CD4 count, thereby reducing the risk of opportunistic infections and improving overall health. Counseling and education about the benefits and necessity of antiretroviral therapy should be provided to the patient.",Success

"A 14-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with hand pain after falling from his skateboard one day ago. He reports that he lost his balance while attempting a new trick and fell on his outstretched hands. He has been icing his hand and taking several tablets of ibuprofen every few hours, but the pain and swelling have not improved. The patient reports that he has not been able to use the hand to take notes in school. His past medical history is significant for infectious mononucleosis last year and type 1 diabetes mellitus for which he has an insulin pump. On physical exam, there is mild swelling over the dorsal aspect of the hand and wrist. He has tenderness in the region between the extensor pollicus longus and the extensor pollicus brevis of the right hand.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"Given the patient's history of falling on his outstretched hand and the persistence of pain and swelling despite self-management with ice and ibuprofen, the best next step in management is:

B. Radiograph of the wrist

This will help evaluate for any potential fractures, particularly in the region where the patient is experiencing tenderness, which could involve the metacarpals, phalanges, or the base of the thumb (first metacarpal). A wrist radiograph is a non-invasive, relatively quick, and cost-effective initial imaging modality to assess for bony injuries. If a fracture is identified, further management such as immobilization with a cast or splint may be necessary, depending on the type and location of the fracture. If the radiograph is negative but clinical suspicion for injury remains high, further imaging such as an MRI may be considered. However, an MRI is not typically the first-line imaging modality for initial assessment of acute trauma due to its higher cost and less availability in emergency settings compared to radiographs.",Success

The treatment options provided in the question can be evaluated based on their relevance to Bell's Palsy.

A. Botox (Botulinum toxin) is not typically used for the initial treatment of Bell's Palsy. It is sometimes used for the treatment of muscle spasms or in cases of synkinesis (inappropriate movement of facial muscles) that may occur during recovery from Bell's Palsy.

B. Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant medication used to treat seizures and neuropathic pain. It is not typically used for Bell's Palsy.

C. Vitamin B12 is used to treat vitamin B12 deficiency and is not typically used for Bell's Palsy unless there is a concurrent deficiency.

D. Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid that is often used in the treatment of Bell's Palsy to reduce inflammation and swelling around the facial nerve. Since the patient has already been given a course of corticosteroids and has not fully recovered, it is possible that the neurologist may recommend another course or a different dosage of corticosteroids.

E. Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections. It is not typically used for Bell's Palsy unless there is a concurrent bacterial infection.

Given the patient's symptoms and the context provided, the most likely treatment option being prescribed to this patient is D. Methylprednisolone, as it is a common treatment for Bell's Palsy.

"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. Her younger brother has mild developmental delay, pale complexion, and has to limit his dietary intake of phenylalanine. She has no similar symptoms and is in good health. Her parents are healthy. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother?",A,"The disease affecting her brother is most likely phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive disorder. For autosomal recessive conditions, if both parents are healthy but have an affected child, it means they are both carriers of the disease (heterozygous for the recessive allele). Each parent has one normal allele and one mutated allele. When two carriers have children, there is a 25% chance of having an affected child (recessive allele from both parents), a 50% chance of having a carrier child (like the parents), and a 25% chance of having a child who is neither affected nor a carrier (both normal alleles).

Given that the woman's brother has the disease and her parents are healthy, it is highly likely that both her parents are carriers. Therefore, she has a 2/3 chance of being a carrier herself (since there is a 1/3 chance she received both normal alleles from her parents and a 2/3 chance she received one normal and one mutated allele). However, without genetic testing, we cannot be certain of her carrier status, but the most likely estimate based on genetics principles is:

B. 33% (This is not the exact probability, but it's the closest option to the 2/3 or approximately 66.67% chance that she is a carrier based on the information provided.)",Success

What is the mechanism of action of the drug which is indicated for the treatment of this patient’s most likely condition?",B,"The patient's history of sudden knee swelling, particularly after physical activity, and the high white blood cell (WBC) count in the synovial fluid tap, suggests a possible septic arthritis. The high number of WBCs (90,000 cells/mm3) is indicative of an inflammatory process, and in the context of the patient's sexual history, there is a risk of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) causing the arthritis.

The treatment for septic arthritis typically involves antibiotics to target the causative organism. The mechanism of action of antibiotics can vary, but in the context of the options provided:

A. Metabolic inhibitor - This could refer to antibiotics that inhibit bacterial metabolism, such as sulfonamides or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. However, these are not typically the first-line treatment for septic arthritis.

B. Cell wall inhibitor - This refers to antibiotics that inhibit the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, such as penicillins and cephalosporins. These are commonly used as first-line treatment for septic arthritis because they effectively target a wide range of potential causative bacteria.

C. Neutrophil migration inhibitor - This is not a mechanism of action for antibiotics, but rather for drugs that might be used to treat inflammation or autoimmune diseases.

D. Prostaglandin inhibitor - This refers to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins, which are involved in the inflammatory response. While NSAIDs can be used to manage pain and inflammation in arthritis, they are not the primary treatment for septic arthritis.

E. Uric acid synthesis inhibitor - This refers to drugs like allopurinol, which are used to treat gout by reducing uric acid levels. Gout can cause sudden onset of joint pain and swelling, but the treatment is not relevant to septic arthritis.

Given the context, the most likely answer is:

B. Cell wall inhibitor

Which of the following patient presentations seen in a pediatric immunology clinic is most consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia?,D,"The patient presentation that is most consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is Option D: A 9-month-old boy who has had recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia in the past three months.

Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, also known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by a failure of B-cell development. Patients typically present in the first year of life, after the protective effect of maternal antibodies has waned, with recurrent bacterial infections, particularly of the respiratory tract. Otitis media and pneumonia are common presentations, and the lack of immunoglobulins (antibodies) makes these patients susceptible to infections caused by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The other options do not fit the typical presentation of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia:

A. Progressive clumsiness suggests a neurological issue, which is not typically associated with Bruton's agammaglobulinemia.
B. Hypocalcemia during the neonatal period is not a feature of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia and suggests a different underlying condition.
C. Repeated oral candidiasis indicates a deficiency in cell-mediated immunity, which is not the hallmark of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, which primarily affects humoral immunity.
E. Eczema and easy bruising suggest a different type of immunodeficiency or a non-immunological condition. Eczema is not typically associated with Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, and easy bruising could indicate a bleeding disorder.",Success

Among the options provided, the best predictor of a good prognosis is:

A. Affective symptoms

The presence of affective symptoms, such as mood disorders, in addition to psychotic symptoms, can sometimes indicate a better response to treatment and a better overall prognosis. This is because affective symptoms can be more responsive to treatment than the primary symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions. Additionally, the presence of mood symptoms may suggest a different diagnosis, such as schizoaffective disorder, which can also have a better prognosis than schizophrenia.

This condition is known as Gilbert's syndrome, which is a hereditary condition characterized by mild, intermittent hyperbilirubinemia (high levels of bilirubin in the blood) and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). Gilbert's syndrome is due to a genetic variation that leads to reduced activity of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase enzyme, which is responsible for conjugating (attaching a glucuronic acid molecule to) bilirubin so that it can be excreted in the bile. When the enzyme activity is reduced, bilirubin accumulates in the blood, leading to jaundice, especially under conditions of stress, fasting, or alcohol consumption.

The other options are less likely given the patient's history and presentation:
A. Autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of the biliary tract would present with more severe and chronic symptoms, such as pruritus (itching), fatigue, and dark urine.
B. Chronic viral infection of the liver (e.g., hepatitis B or C) would likely have other symptoms such as fatigue, abdominal pain, and elevated liver enzymes on blood tests.
D. Defective bilirubin excretion is seen in conditions like Dubin-Johnson syndrome or Rotor syndrome, which are typically associated with persistent hyperbilirubinemia and not typically triggered by fasting or alcohol consumption.
E. Macrovesicular steatosis (fatty liver) can be caused by excessive alcohol consumption or obesity but is not typically associated with jaundice unless there is significant liver damage.",Success
A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of vertigo and feeling unsteady while walking. She reports that she has had episodic tinnitus in her right ear for the past 3 years. Neurologic examination shows hearing loss in the right ear. An MRI of the brain is shown. Pathologic examination of this patient's lesion is most likely to show which of the following?,C,"The MRI and clinical presentation suggest a diagnosis of vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma). Pathologic examination of this patient's lesion is most likely to show whorls of densely packed cells with areas of lamellated calcification, which is characteristic of Antoni A areas in schwannomas.

A 47-year-old female presents to her primary physician for follow up after an ED visit for nephrolithiasis 1 week prior. CT scan in the ED revealed a 4-mm stone occluding the right ureter. She was able to pass the stone without assistance over the course of 5 hours. Pathology report on the stone states it was composed of calcium oxalate. She says that the pain of passing the stone was excruciating and asks how she can prevent kidney stones in the future. Which of the following interventions is most likely to prevent renal calculi formation in the future for this patient?,B,"The correct answer is B. Decreasing sodium intake.

Reducing sodium intake is a recommended intervention for preventing the recurrence of calcium oxalate kidney stones. Sodium can increase the amount of calcium excreted in the urine, which can contribute to stone formation. By decreasing sodium intake, the amount of calcium in the urine can be reduced, thereby decreasing the risk of stone formation.

A. Decreasing calcium intake is not recommended as it may not reduce stone formation and could potentially lead to bone loss. Adequate calcium intake helps to bind oxalate in the gut, preventing its absorption and reducing the amount available for stone formation.

C. Increasing consumption of nuts and seeds is not recommended as they are high in oxalate and can contribute to stone formation.

D. Loop diuretic pharmacotherapy is not typically used to prevent calcium oxalate stones. Loop diuretics can increase the risk of stone formation by increasing calcium excretion.

E. Urine acidification with cranberry juice is not an effective strategy for preventing calcium oxalate stones. In fact, acidifying the urine can increase the risk of uric acid stone formation.",Success
"A 62-year-old man comes to the physician because of worsening involuntary movements of both arms for the past 7 months. He reports that certain daily activities have become more difficult to perform. His father had a similar condition that was treated with medications. The patient appears anxious. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a low-amplitude tremor bilaterally when the arms are outstretched that worsens when reaching out to grab a pen. Muscle strength and tone is normal bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. On mental status examination, his mood is good. His speech is normal in rate and rhythm. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",E,"The most appropriate next step in management for this patient is likely C. Levodopa and carbidopa therapy. The patient's symptoms are consistent with Parkinson's disease, given the presence of a low-amplitude tremor that worsens with intentional movement, and his family history of a similar condition treated with medications. Levodopa and carbidopa are commonly used to treat Parkinson's disease and can help alleviate the symptoms such as tremors and difficulty with daily activities. Deep brain stimulation (A) and thalamotomy (B) are more invasive treatments typically reserved for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who do not respond to medication. Clonazepam (D) and propranolol (E) can be used to treat tremors, but they are not specific to Parkinson's disease and are less effective than levodopa and carbidopa in managing the broader range of symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease.",Success
"Ten days after undergoing a cadaveric renal transplant, a 21-year-old man has pain in the right lower abdomen and generalized fatigue. During the past 2 days, he has had decreasing urinary output. He passed 5 liters of urine on the second postoperative day and serum studies showed a creatinine concentration of 2.1 mg/dL. He has adult polycystic kidney disease and was on maintenance hemodialysis for 2 months prior to transplantation. Current medications include azathioprine, cyclosporine, prednisone, and enalapril. He appears lethargic. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 164/94 mm Hg. Examination shows a healing surgical incision in the right lower abdomen. The graft site shows tenderness to palpation. His blood urea nitrogen concentration is 52 mg/dL, creatinine concentration is 4.1 mg/dL. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows tubulitis. C4d staining is negative. Which of the following is the most likely responsible for this patient's findings?",A,"The most likely cause of this patient's findings is A. Recipient T-cells in the graft. The presence of tubulitis on biopsy is indicative of acute cellular rejection, which is typically mediated by T-cells from the recipient recognizing the graft as foreign and attacking it. The negative C4d staining suggests that this is not an antibody-mediated rejection, which would be more likely to be associated with positive C4d staining due to complement activation by antibodies. The other options (B, C, D, E) do not fit the clinical and histological findings as well as acute cellular rejection does.",Success
"A 58-year-old woman presents to the office for routine follow-up. She recently underwent routine screening for bone density due to a history of hypothyroidism. She also has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that is being treated with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) and more recently with a histamine2 receptor antagonist (H2RA), hypertension being treated with a thiazide diuretic, depression being treated with lithium, and hormone replacement therapy. Her results meet the criteria for osteopenia, with a T-score of -1.6. She is concerned about progressive bone loss and the risk of fractures. Which of the following medication classes should be discontinued?",A,"A. Proton-pump inhibitors

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis-related fractures, likely due to their effect on calcium absorption. Long-term use of PPIs may contribute to bone loss and increase the risk of fractures, especially in individuals who are already at risk for osteoporosis. Given the patient's history of osteopenia and her concern about progressive bone loss and fracture risk, discontinuing the PPI could potentially help to mitigate this risk. However, any change in medication should be discussed with her healthcare provider to ensure that her GERD is adequately managed with alternative therapies if necessary.",Success

His respirations are 24/min, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg, and pulse is 141/min and irregularly irregular. Examination shows multiple ecchymoses over the chest. There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) laceration over the abdomen and a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over the scalp. Jugular venous pressure is increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft. Two large bore intravenous catheters are inserted and 0.9% saline infusion is begun. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) is negative. An electrocardiogram shows absent p-waves. After 5 minutes, his pulse is 160/min and palpable systolic blood pressure is 50 mm Hg. Vasopressors are administered. One hour later, the patient dies. Which of the following was the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The most likely diagnosis in this scenario is E. Cardiac tamponade. The patient's presentation with hypotension, tachycardia, and an irregularly irregular pulse, along with the absence of p-waves on the electrocardiogram, suggests a significant cardiac issue. The increased jugular venous pressure is also indicative of cardiac tamponade, where the heart is compressed by fluid (usually blood) in the pericardial space, leading to impaired filling and reduced cardiac output. Despite attempts at resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasopressors, the patient's condition deteriorates rapidly, leading to death, which is consistent with the severity of cardiac tamponade.",Success
"A 65-year-old man with a longstanding history of poorly-controlled hypertension and no recent illness or cardiac disease presents to clinic complaining of chest pain that is worse on inspiration and relieved by sitting forward. Vital signs are stable. On exam, you detect a friction rub. Routine labs show K 7.5 and Cr 5.1. If this patient's clinical signs and laboratory findings are indicative of a chronic condition, what would be expected on urinary analysis?",E,"Given the patient's history of poorly-controlled hypertension, elevated serum potassium (K 7.5), and creatinine (Cr 5.1), these findings suggest chronic kidney disease (CKD) with possible superimposed acute kidney injury. The presence of a friction rub and chest pain that is worse on inspiration and relieved by sitting forward also suggests pericarditis, which can be associated with uremic pericarditis in the context of CKD.

In the context of CKD, the expected findings on urinary analysis would be:

E. Broad and waxy casts

Waxy casts are typically associated with chronic renal damage and are indicative of long-standing renal disease. They are formed from the coalescence of hyaline casts and are often seen in patients with CKD. Broad casts can also be present in severe renal disease and suggest tubular damage.

The other options are less likely in this scenario:

A. Muddy brown granular casts are typically associated with acute tubular necrosis, which is an acute kidney injury rather than a chronic condition.
B. Red blood cell casts may be seen in acute glomerulonephritis or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, but they are not typically associated with chronic kidney disease.
C. White blood cell casts are indicative of acute pyelonephritis or interstitial nephritis, which are not the primary concern in this patient's chronic condition.

"A 67-year-old woman with depression comes to the physician because of easy bruising and bleeding of her gums for the past 2 months. She has been living alone since the death of her husband 1 year ago. She appears thin and has temporal wasting bilaterally. Physical examination shows bruises on her lower legs, swollen gums, and petechiae on the hard palate. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to defective synthesis of a substance that is composed primarily of which of the following amino acids?",A,"The patient's symptoms of easy bruising, bleeding gums, and petechiae, along with her appearance of thinness and temporal wasting, suggest a deficiency in vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Vitamin C is essential for the synthesis of collagen, a protein that provides structural support in connective tissues, including blood vessels and gums. A deficiency in vitamin C can lead to scurvy, which is characterized by symptoms such as those presented by the patient.

The amino acids that are primarily involved in the synthesis of collagen are glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline. Hydroxyproline is not listed among the options, but it is derived from proline. Therefore, the correct answer would be:

B. Proline

However, it is important to note that the question is somewhat misleading because the symptoms described are not directly due to a defective synthesis of an amino acid but rather due to a deficiency in vitamin C, which is necessary for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen. Thus, while proline is involved in collagen synthesis, the actual issue in this case is a vitamin C deficiency.",Success
"A 49-year-old female with a history of alcoholism was found lying unconscious on a bench at a local park and rushed to the emergency department. Upon arrival, the patient regained consciousness and complained of intense bilateral flank pain and a recent decrease in urination. Urine microscopy demonstrated abundant square crystals of calcium oxalate that looked like “folded envelopes."" Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen in this patient:",B,"The patient's history of alcoholism, symptoms of bilateral flank pain, decreased urination, and the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine suggest a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. Ethylene glycol is a common antifreeze ingredient and is often ingested accidentally or in suicide attempts. It is also found in some alcoholic beverages, and chronic alcoholics may be at risk for exposure.

Ethylene glycol poisoning leads to a specific pattern of metabolic acidosis characterized by an increased anion gap. This is because ethylene glycol is metabolized into toxic metabolites, including glycolic acid and oxalic acid, which are not paired with a cation and thus increase the anion gap. These metabolites also lead to the formation of calcium oxalate crystals, which can be seen in the urine and are indicative of ethylene glycol poisoning.

Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient is:

Nitrazine testing is positive. She is started on indomethacin. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The most appropriate next step in management for a patient presenting at 32 weeks' gestation with clear vaginal discharge, positive nitrazine test, and uterine contractions is to administer betamethasone and ampicillin while preparing for potential preterm delivery. However, the decision to proceed with a cesarean section or induction of labor should be based on further assessment of the patient's condition, including the cervical status, fetal lung maturity, and the presence of any contraindications to vaginal delivery. Given the options provided, option C (administer ampicillin and test amniotic fluid for fetal lung maturity) seems the most reasonable initial step before deciding on the mode of delivery.

However, it is important to note that the administration of betamethasone (a corticosteroid used to accelerate fetal lung maturity) is a critical intervention in this scenario, and it should not be delayed. Therefore, the best course of action would be to administer betamethasone and ampicillin while testing amniotic fluid for fetal lung maturity. This would allow for the acceleration of fetal lung maturity and the assessment of whether the baby is ready for delivery, which would inform the decision on whether to proceed with induction of labor or cesarean section.

Thus, the most appropriate next step in management, considering the options provided, would be a combination of elements from options C and D, with an emphasis on administering betamethasone to promote fetal lung maturity and ampicillin for prophylaxis against infection. The decision to proceed with cesarean section or induction of labor should be made after evaluating the results of fetal lung maturity testing and the overall clinical condition of the mother and fetus.

"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).

On physical examination, the patient is fully conscious. Her radial pulse is absent at her right wrist and 1+ at her left wrist. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin: 10.9 g/dL
Hematocrit: 34.7%
Leukocyte count: 5,500/mm3
Neutrophils: 65%
Lymphocytes: 30%
Monocytes: 5%
Mean corpuscular volume: 78.2 μm3
Platelet count: 190,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 56 mm/h
What complications is this patient at risk for?",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, she may be at risk for several complications. The absent radial pulse on the right wrist and a weak pulse on the left, combined with her symptoms of increasing fatigue and joint pain, suggest a possible diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis, a type of vasculitis that can affect the aorta and its branches, including the arteries to the head and arms. This condition can lead to decreased blood flow to certain areas of the body, which can cause a variety of complications.

A. Amaurosis fugax: This is a transient loss of vision in one eye, often due to a temporary decrease in blood flow to the retina. It can be a symptom of Takayasu arteritis, especially if the ophthalmic artery is affected.

B. Myocardial infarction: While less likely in this specific context, decreased blood flow to the coronary arteries could potentially lead to a myocardial infarction (heart attack). However, this is not a typical complication of Takayasu arteritis.

C. Tongue infarction: Infarction of the tongue is extremely rare but can occur in severe cases of vasculitis where there is significant reduction in blood flow to the tongue.

D. Palpable purpura: This is a rash that appears as small, purple spots on the skin and can be a sign of vasculitis. However, it is not a typical finding in Takayasu arteritis and is more commonly associated with other forms of vasculitis, such as Henoch-Schönlein purpura.

E. Polyneuropathy: This is a condition characterized by damage to the peripheral nerves, often resulting in weakness, numbness, and pain. While it can be a complication of certain vasculitides, it is not typically associated with Takayasu arteritis.

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the most likely complications she is at risk for are A. Amaurosis fugax and possibly C. Tongue infarction, if her vasculitis is severe enough to affect the blood supply to these areas. However, it's important to note that a definitive diagnosis would require further diagnostic testing, including imaging studies and possibly a biopsy of the affected arteries.",Success
"A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of an acute, painful swelling of the left labia that she first noticed that morning. She also reports some pain while sitting and walking. She is sexually active with her boyfriend and states that she has been having pain during vaginal intercourse lately. She has no history of serious illness. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a left-sided, tender mass surrounded by edema and erythema in the left inner labia. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The most appropriate next step in management for this patient with an acute, painful swelling of the left labia, accompanied by erythema and edema, is likely **C. Incision and drainage**. These symptoms are indicative of a Bartholin's gland abscess or cyst, which can become infected and lead to the described signs and symptoms. Incision and drainage is a common treatment for such abscesses to relieve pain and facilitate healing. Additionally, antibiotics such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (option E) may be prescribed post-procedure to prevent or treat infection. However, based on the immediate need to address the abscess, incision and drainage is the most appropriate initial step.",Success
A 21-year-old female presents to the clinic requesting prenatal counseling. She was born with a disease that has led her to have recurrent upper respiratory infections throughout her life requiring antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. She marries a man (without this disease phenotype) from a population where the prevalence of this disease is 1/100. What is the chance that their child will have the disease of interest?,A,"The disease described in the question is cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. CF is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning that a person must inherit two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to develop the disease. If only one copy is inherited, the person is a carrier but does not have the disease.

Given that the woman has cystic fibrosis, she has two copies of the mutated gene. Her husband does not have the disease phenotype, but we need to calculate the probability that he is a carrier based on the prevalence of the disease in the population.

The prevalence of cystic fibrosis in the general population is about 1 in 2500 to 3500, but the question states that in the man's population, the prevalence is 1 in 100. This prevalence reflects the number of people who have the disease, but we need to find the carrier frequency.

The carrier frequency can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The equation is:

p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1

where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (normal CFTR gene), and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (mutated CFTR gene). The frequency of the disease (q^2) is given as 1/100, which means q^2 = 0.01. To find q, we take the square root of 0.01, which is 0.1.

Since q is the frequency of the recessive allele, p (the frequency of the dominant allele) can be calculated as 1 - q, which is 0.9.

The frequency of carriers (2pq) is then:

2 * 0.9 * 0.1 = 0.18 or 18/100

So, there is an 18% chance that the man is a carrier of the mutated CFTR gene. If he is a carrier, there is a 50% chance that he will pass the mutated gene to his child. Since the woman has two mutated genes, any child that inherits the mutated gene from the man will have cystic fibrosis.

The probability that their child will have cystic fibrosis is therefore:

18/100 (chance man is a carrier) * 1/2 (chance he passes the mutated gene to the child) = 9/100

So, the correct answer is:

A. 9/100",Success
"A 45-year-old woman presents to the physician with a history of headache, palpitations, and episodic diaphoresis. She was diagnosed with hypertension in the past and is now regularly taking antihypertensive medication (amlodipine 10 mg once daily). She has had a diffuse thyroid swelling for the past 4 months.

Her upper extremities exhibit fine tremors during an anxiety attack. The laboratory test results reveal elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines. Serum epinephrine, calcitonin, and parathormone levels are also elevated. Hypercalcemia and hyperglycemia are also noted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is C. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of hypertension, palpitations, and episodic diaphoresis, along with elevated urinary VMA and metanephrines, suggest the presence of a pheochromocytoma, which is common in MEN 2A. The diffuse thyroid swelling and elevated calcitonin levels indicate medullary thyroid carcinoma, another characteristic feature of MEN 2A. The hypercalcemia and elevated parathormone levels suggest primary hyperparathyroidism, which can also be associated with MEN 2A. The hyperglycemia may be secondary to the catecholamine excess from the pheochromocytoma. The fine tremors during an anxiety attack may be related to the hyperthyroid state often seen in MEN 2A due to the medullary thyroid carcinoma.",Success
"A 57-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of increasing shortness of breath on exertion and a cough productive of a small amount of grayish-white phlegm. The cough had been initially nonproductive. He has not had fever or chest pain. He is originally from China and visits his family there once every year. He has worked as a car salesman for 15 years and worked in a shipyard before that for 22 years. He smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for 13 years but stopped 25 years ago. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Fine expiratory crackles are heard at both lung bases. An x-ray of the chest shows patchy infiltrates and supradiaphragmatic pleural thickening in both lungs. A photomicrograph from a sputum sample is shown. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",A,"The patient's history of working in a shipyard, where he may have been exposed to asbestos, combined with the chest x-ray findings of patchy infiltrates and supradiaphragmatic pleural thickening, suggests a diagnosis of asbestosis or asbestos-related pleural disease. The photomicrograph from the sputum sample is not provided, but if it shows asbestos bodies, this would further support the diagnosis.

Asbestosis is characterized by interstitial lung disease, which can lead to a restrictive lung pattern on pulmonary function tests (PFTs). This would manifest as a decreased total lung capacity (TLC), not an increased TLC, so option C is incorrect. The restrictive lung pattern can also result in a decreased diffusing capacity (DLCO), not an increased one, so option E is incorrect.

The fine expiratory crackles heard at both lung bases can be indicative of interstitial lung disease, which can also cause an increased alveolar-arterial gradient due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch, making option A a possible finding.

A concave flow-volume loop on spirometry is typically seen in patients with fixed airway obstruction, such as in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), not in asbestosis, so option D is less likely.

Bloody pleural effusion can occur in asbestos-related pleural disease, but it is not the most likely finding based on the given information. Pleural effusions in asbestos-related disease are often exudative and may contain malignant cells in cases of mesothelioma, but the initial presentation is more likely to be related to interstitial lung disease.

Therefore, the most likely finding on further evaluation of this patient would be:

A. Increased alveolar-arterial gradient",Success
"A 45-year-old woman presents with sudden-onset dyspnea. Her past medical history is significant for varicose veins in her lower extremities, well-controlled diabetes mellitus type 2, and a 25 pack-year smoking history.

Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), the pulse is 111/min, the respirations are 18/min, and the blood pressure is 130/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is pale and diaphoretic. Cardiac exam is significant for an S3 gallop. There is erythema and swelling over multiple varicose veins in her left leg. Ultrasound of her left leg is positive for a deep vein thrombosis. The patient is admitted, and anticoagulation is started with a vitamin K inhibitor. However, despite these interventions, she dies shortly after admission. Which of the following was the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition?",D,"The most likely etiology of this patient's condition is a pulmonary embolism (PE), which is not listed as an option but is the direct consequence of the deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her left leg. The symptoms of sudden-onset dyspnea, tachycardia, and the presence of an S3 gallop on cardiac exam are consistent with a PE. The patient's history of varicose veins, smoking, and a family history of pulmonary embolism are all risk factors for thromboembolic disease. The erythema and swelling over multiple varicose veins in her left leg, confirmed by ultrasound to be a DVT, is the source of the embolism.

Given the context, the closest option that could be related to her condition is:

D. Protein S deficiency

Protein S deficiency is a condition that increases the risk of blood clots, including DVTs and PEs. However, the immediate cause of her death was likely a massive PE, which is not directly listed among the options provided.

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals multiple duodenal ulcers. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is D. VIPoma. A VIPoma, also known as Verner-Morrison syndrome or pancreatic cholera, is a rare type of tumor that secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), leading to a characteristic triad of symptoms: watery diarrhea, hypokalemia (low potassium), and achlorhydria (low stomach acid). However, the presentation of multiple duodenal ulcers in this patient is more suggestive of excessive acid secretion, which can also be a feature of VIPoma due to the tumor's ability to stimulate gastric acid secretion indirectly.

In this case, the patient's symptoms of persistent epigastric pain worsening a few hours after eating, along with the finding of multiple duodenal ulcers on endoscopy, point towards a diagnosis related to excessive acid production. While H. pylori infection (Option C) can cause peptic ulcers, it typically does not present with multiple ulcers and a family history of similar symptoms. Gastric adenocarcinoma (Option B) would not typically present with the symptomatology described. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (Option A) is less likely to cause multiple duodenal ulcers. MEN1 (Option E) can be associated with gastrinomas (gastrin-secreting tumors) that cause peptic ulcers, but the specific presentation here is more indicative of a VIPoma.

A VIPoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially given the patient's family history and the presence of multiple duodenal ulcers. Further testing, such as measurement of serum VIP levels and imaging studies, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",Success
"The parents of a 16-year-old boy with type 1 diabetes mellitus present requesting information about the drug, exenatide, an injectable drug that only needs to be administered once a week. The patient’s blood glucose levels have been difficult to control on his current insulin regimen due to poor adherence to recommended therapy, and he has had difficulty putting on weight despite eating copiously. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. His body mass index (BMI) is 19 kg/m2. Which of the following best describes why the patient should not be switched to exenatide?",A,"The best answer to the question is C. Suppression of appetite makes it even harder for him to gain weight.

Exenatide is an injectable medication that belongs to a class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists. These drugs work by stimulating insulin secretion when blood glucose levels are high, delaying gastric emptying, and suppressing appetite. In patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin production by the pancreas is already insufficient, but exenatide can still be used in conjunction with insulin to help control blood glucose levels. However, one of the side effects of exenatide is decreased appetite, which can lead to weight loss. In this case, the patient has already been having difficulty gaining weight, and the use of exenatide could exacerbate this issue. Therefore, switching the patient to exenatide may not be the best option given his current weight concerns.

Options A, B, D, and E are not the best answers because:
A. Exenatide can still be effective in patients with type 1 diabetes when used in conjunction with insulin.
B. Exenatide does suppress glucagon secretion, but this effect can actually help to reduce blood glucose levels, which is beneficial for patients with diabetes.
D. The age restriction for exenatide may vary by country and indication, but in the context of type 1 diabetes, it is not automatically contraindicated for patients under 18 years of age.
E. Gastric emptying is indeed inhibited by exenatide, but this effect can help to reduce postprandial (after eating) blood glucose spikes, which is a positive outcome for patients with diabetes.",Success

However, in this question, only the upper airway volume and the conducting airway volume are provided. The alveolar dead space is not given, but it can be calculated using the information provided.

The alveolar dead space can be calculated using the difference between the arterial CO2 pressure (PaCO2) and the expired CO2 pressure (PeCO2), which is a measure of the CO2 in the alveoli.

Six months ago, combined antiretroviral therapy consisting of dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine was initiated. Laboratory studies show a decrease in the CD4 count and an increase in the viral load despite ongoing treatment. The patient is switched to a new treatment regimen, including a drug that acts by preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation. Which of the following is the most likely drug?",B,"The drug that acts by preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation is most likely Lamivudine (Option E). However, it's important to note that Lamivudine does require intracellular phosphorylation to become active, but among the options provided, it is the only one that directly inhibits viral DNA synthesis. The description given might have been intended to highlight drugs that do not require host cell enzymes for activation, but in this context, Lamivudine is the closest match based on its mechanism of action as a reverse transcriptase inhibitor.",Success
A 14-year-old girl presents with sudden drooping of the right side of her face with drooling and excessive tearing. The patient’s mother says that the patient was recently in northern Maine and spent most of her time during the trip outdoors. Physical examination reveals a slight asymmetry of the facial muscles with an inability to whistle or close the right eye. A circular red rash with central clearing is present on the trunk. There is also decreased taste sensation. Which of the following most likely transmitted the organism responsible for this patient’s illness?,A,"The patient's symptoms, including facial drooping, drooling, excessive tearing, inability to whistle or close the right eye, and decreased taste sensation, suggest a diagnosis of Bell's palsy. However, the additional detail of a circular red rash with central clearing on the trunk points to Lyme disease, which is often accompanied by Bell's palsy as a neurological complication.

Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected black-legged tick, also known as Ixodes scapularis. The patient's recent travel to northern Maine, where these ticks are prevalent, and her outdoor activities increase the likelihood of tick exposure.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A. Ixodes scapularis",Success
"A 66-year-old man with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes presents to the clinic with elevated liver function tests from baseline. He has a blood pressure of 136/92 mm Hg and a heart rate of 69/min. On physical examination, his heart sounds are regular and lung sounds are clear. Current medications include simvastatin, metformin, fenofibrate, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, glyburide, and lisinopril. Of these medications, which could contribute to the patient’s transaminitis?",B,"The medication that could contribute to the patient's transaminitis (elevated liver function tests) is:

B. Simvastatin

Statins, such as simvastatin, are known to potentially cause liver enzyme elevations, although this is usually mild and reversible upon discontinuation of the medication. It is important to monitor liver function tests in patients taking statins, especially if they have pre-existing liver disease or are taking other medications that can affect liver function.",Success
"A 7 -day-old newborn boy presents to the emergency department with a history of fever, irritability, and generalized erythema. During the first 2 days of clinical manifestations, the parents of the child tried to control the symptoms using acetaminophen; however, the newborn continued to be ill, and blisters were noticeable around the buttocks, hands, and feet. During the physical examination, the vital signs include body temperature 39.0°C (102.3°F), heart rate 130/min, and respiratory rate 45/min. Ears, nose, and oral mucosa preserved their integrity, while the skin presents with diffuse blanching erythema and flaccid blisters with a positive Nikolsky’s sign. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The most likely diagnosis in this patient is B. Scalded skin syndrome (Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, SSIS). This condition is caused by exfoliative toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus, leading to a widespread rash that resembles a burn, with blisters and skin peeling. The positive Nikolsky's sign, which indicates that the skin tears easily when rubbed, is a characteristic feature of this condition. The fever, irritability, and erythema also align with the clinical presentation of scalded skin syndrome.",Success
"A 60-year-old woman presents to the outpatient clinic complaining of severe vulvar itching that has been gradually worsening for the past year. She mentions that she has tried over-the-counter lubricants, but lubricants do not seem to provide substantial relief. Her medical history is remarkable for diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. Menopause occurred at 52 years of age. She has been sexually active with her husband until recently and reports severe pain during vaginal intercourse. The physical examination reveals dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area with atrophy of the labia minora. The clitoris appears retracted. The perianal skin appears pale and wrinkled. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings is B. Lichen sclerosus. This condition is characterized by white, plaque-like lesions, atrophy of the labia minora, and retraction of the clitoris, which are consistent with the patient's presentation. Additionally, the patient's age and symptoms of severe itching and pain during intercourse are also indicative of lichen sclerosus.

"A 50-year-old woman with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) presents to your clinic with complaints of left eye pain and reduced vision. She notes that she was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to presentation when she noticed some mild tenderness around her left eye, unrelieved by any pain relievers. This morning when she woke up she was unable to see out of her left eye and made an appointment to come see you. Other than SLE, her medical history is unremarkable. She has had no additional symptoms other than pain and vision loss. Her vital signs are all within normal limits. On exam, she has no vision in her left eye, but 20/30 visual acuity in her right eye. When you shine a light in her left eye there is no response. What response would you expect when you shine a light in her right eye?",B,"The response you would expect when you shine a light in her right eye is:

B. Bilateral miosis

This is known as the consensual light reflex. When a light is shone in one eye, both pupils should constrict. However, since her left eye does not respond to light (due to the loss of vision), shining a light in the right eye will cause both the right and left pupils to constrict, demonstrating an intact consensual light reflex. This indicates that the afferent pathway of the optic nerve in the right eye is intact and the efferent pathway to both pupils is also intact.",Success
"A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain. She states that she was walking up the stairs at work when she felt sudden and severe abdominal pain followed by nausea and vomiting. Her past medical history is non-contributory and she is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.7°F (37.6°C), blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of abdominal tenderness, a left adnexal mass, and left adnexal tenderness. A transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates free fluid surrounding the ovary with edema and the presence of doppler flow. A urinary pregnancy test is negative. The patient's symptoms persisted after ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and the findings from the transvaginal ultrasound, the best next step in management is likely option B: Laparoscopy. The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, in conjunction with the presence of a left adnexal mass, left adnexal tenderness, and free fluid surrounding the ovary with edema and doppler flow, suggests a possible torsion of the ovarian mass or another acute surgical pathology.

A laparoscopy would allow for a direct visualization of the pelvic and abdominal organs, and it could provide an opportunity for surgical intervention if necessary. This procedure is less invasive than a laparotomy (option C) and is often the preferred method for diagnosing and treating conditions such as ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent ovarian necrosis.

Options A (CT scan of the abdomen) and D (MRI of the pelvis) are imaging studies that could provide additional information, but they do not offer the therapeutic potential of laparoscopy in this acute setting. Option E (observation and serial abdominal exams) is not appropriate given the severity and acuity of the patient's symptoms, which suggest an urgent surgical condition.",Success
"A 65-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressively worsening fatigue for 6 months. During this time, he has also had shortness of breath and palpitations on exertion.

His pulse is 95/min and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Examination shows pale conjunctivae. The abdomen is soft with no organomegaly. Rectal examination is unremarkable. His hemoglobin concentration is 7.2 g/dL, hematocrit is 32%, and mean corpuscular volume is 68 μm3. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's bleeding?",E,"The patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, palpitations, and blood in his stools, combined with his low hemoglobin concentration, low hematocrit, and low mean corpuscular volume (indicative of microcytic anemia), suggest a chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. The options given are all potential causes of gastrointestinal bleeding, but we need to consider which is most likely in this patient with end-stage renal disease, type 2 diabetes, and a history of alcohol consumption.

A. Dilated submucosal veins in the lower third of the esophagus (esophageal varices) are typically associated with portal hypertension, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. However, alcohol consumption can lead to liver disease and portal hypertension, making this a possible cause, but not the most likely given the absence of liver disease symptoms.

B. Inflammation in an outpouching of the colonic wall (diverticulitis) can cause bleeding, especially if there is an inflamed or infected diverticulum. This is a common cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in older adults, and without further information, it could be a potential cause.

C. Symptomatic enlargement of the hemorrhoidal plexus (hemorrhoids) can cause bleeding, especially if they are external or prolapsed. However, the patient's history does not specifically mention rectal examination findings that would suggest hemorrhoids.

D. Chronic mucosal and submucosal inflammation of the colon (such as inflammatory bowel disease) can cause bleeding, but there are no specific symptoms mentioned that would point to this diagnosis, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, or weight loss.

E. Arteriovenous malformation in the colonic wall can cause chronic bleeding and is a possible cause of the patient's symptoms. This condition is often silent until it bleeds, which can lead to anemia.

Given the patient's symptoms and the laboratory findings, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's bleeding is D. Chronic mucosal and submucosal inflammation of the colon, which could be due to conditions such as chronic colitis or diverticulitis. However, without further diagnostic tests such as a colonoscopy, it is difficult to definitively determine the cause. Option D is the most encompassing of the potential causes given the patient's presentation.",Success

Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows an incomplete right bundle branch block. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is A. Vasovagal syncope. The patient's symptoms, including becoming diaphoretic (sweaty), pale, and then losing consciousness during a potentially painful procedure (getting a tattoo), are consistent with a vasovagal episode. The jerky movements of her arms and legs during the episode could be attributed to the muscle contractions that sometimes occur during syncope. The fact that she regained consciousness quickly and was fully oriented afterwards also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, her normal vital signs and lack of focal neurologic findings on examination, along with the absence of a history of serious illness, make vasovagal syncope the most probable diagnosis.",Success

"A 51-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of a 3-week history of abnormal behavior. His wife reports he has been preoccupied with gambling at the local casino. He becomes restless and irritable when his wife attempts to restrict his gambling. Four months ago, he was diagnosed with Parkinson disease and treatment was initiated. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed for this patient?",C,"The drug that was most likely prescribed for this patient is a dopamine agonist or a levodopa preparation, which either directly activates dopamine receptors (Option C) or increases the availability of dopamine (Option B) in the brain. Since the question asks for the mechanism of action that best describes the drug, and considering the context of the patient's behavior, which is a known side effect of dopamine agonists, the most appropriate answer is:

C. Direct activation of dopamine receptors

Dopamine agonists are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease to stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain, compensating for the loss of dopamine-producing neurons. However, they can also lead to impulse control disorders, such as pathological gambling, due to their effect on reward pathways in the brain.",Success

A bone marrow biopsy demonstrates 34% myeloblasts with Auer rods that are myeloperoxidase positive. What is best treatment option?",D,"The patient's presentation and laboratory findings, including the bone marrow biopsy result, suggest a diagnosis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). The presence of myeloblasts with Auer rods and myeloperoxidase positivity are characteristic of AML. The treatment for AML typically involves chemotherapy, and in this case, the best treatment option from the given choices is:

D. Retinoic acid

Retinoic acid (all-trans retinoic acid, ATRA) is used in the treatment of a specific subtype of AML known as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which is characterized by the presence of the t(15;17) translocation.

This diagnosis is characterized by a pervasive pattern of social and interpersonal deficits marked by acute discomfort in relationships, cognitive or perceptual distortions, and eccentric behavior, which is evident in the patient's strange behavior, avoidance of eye contact, poor academic performance, and preoccupation with paranormal phenomena such as demons. The patient's symptoms do not meet the criteria for schizophrenia, as there are no clear psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions. The patient's symptoms also do not meet the criteria for social anxiety disorder or avoidant personality disorder, as these disorders do not typically include cognitive or perceptual distortions or eccentric behavior. Paranoid personality disorder is also less likely, as the patient does not exhibit the pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others that is characteristic of this disorder.",Success
"A 79-year-old man presents to the office due to shortness of breath with moderate exertion and a slightly productive cough. He has a medical history of 25 years of heavy smoking. His vitals include: heart rate 89/min, respiratory rate 27/min, and blood pressure 120/90 mm Hg. The physical exam shows increased resonance to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and crackles at the lung base. Chest radiography shows signs of pulmonary hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) of 48%, a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 85%, and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 56%. According to these results, what is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The most likely diagnosis based on the patient's history, symptoms, and test results is:

C. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

The patient's history of heavy smoking for 25 years, symptoms of shortness of breath with exertion and a productive cough, physical exam findings of increased resonance to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and crackles at the lung base, along with chest radiography showing signs of pulmonary hyperinflation, and spirometry results showing an FEV1 of 48%, FVC of 85%, and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 56% are all consistent with COPD. The reduced FEV1/FVC ratio is a hallmark of obstructive lung disease, which is characteristic of COPD.",Success
