Which is the correct statement regarding the rate of correction and amount of patient’s free water deﬁcit?,D,"The correct answer is D. Assuming minimal ongoing free water losses, the infusion of 4 liters of free water would decrease the serum sodium concentration to approximately 154 mmol/L.

Here's the explanation:

The patient has hypernatremia (serum sodium 176 mmol/L), indicating a free water deficit. To calculate the free water deficit, we can use the following formula:

Free water deficit (L) = Total body water (L) x (1 - (140/serum sodium))

Assuming 45% total body water content in this elderly woman (option B is correct), we can calculate the total body water:

Total body water (L) = 0.45 x 60 kg = 27 L

Free water deficit (L) = 27 L x (1 - (140/176)) ≈ 4.3 L

Now, to determine the amount of free water needed to correct the hypernatremia, we can use the following formula:

Change in serum sodium (mmol/L) = (infused free water volume x 140) / total body water

Rearranging the formula to solve for infused free water volume, we get:

Infused free water volume (L) = (change in serum sodium x total body water) / 140

Let's assume we want to decrease the serum sodium concentration to approximately 154 mmol/L. The change in serum sodium would be:

Change in serum sodium (mmol/L) = 176 - 154 = 22 mmol/L

Infused free water volume (L) = (22 x 27) / 140 ≈ 4.3 L

Therefore, option D is the correct answer. The infusion of 4 liters of free water would decrease the serum sodium concentration to approximately 154 mmol/L, assuming minimal ongoing free water losses.

It's essential to note that the rate of correction should be done cautiously to avoid cerebral edema. A change in serum sodium concentration of 1 mmol/L/h is generally considered safe (option C).",Success
Which ONE of the following diagnoses BEST describes the ultrasonography ﬁndings?,B,"The correct answer is B. Hydronephrosis.

The ultrasonography finding of a dilated pelvis in the right kidney is consistent with hydronephrosis, which is a condition where the kidney swells due to a blockage or obstruction of the urinary tract. This can cause urine to back up into the kidney, leading to dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces. The patient's symptoms of difficulty urinating and the presence of hydronephrosis on ultrasound support this diagnosis.

The other options are not supported by the ultrasound finding:

A. Renal masses would appear as solid or complex lesions on ultrasound, not as a dilated pelvis.

C. Dilated renal vessels would not cause a dilated pelvis.

D. Acquired cystic disease of the kidney typically appears as multiple cysts on ultrasound, not a dilated pelvis.

E. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a genetic disorder that typically presents with multiple cysts on both kidneys, not a dilated pelvis on one kidney.

It's essential to note that the patient's overall clinical presentation, including the elevated creatinine level, anemia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis, suggests chronic kidney disease, and the hydronephrosis may be a contributing factor to his kidney dysfunction.",Success
Which ONE of the following would you advise regarding the effect of PGT on her pregnancy outcomes?,A,"The correct answer is A. The probability of achieving pregnancy is reduced compared with spontaneous conception.

Preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) is a technique used in assisted reproductive technology (ART) to identify genetic abnormalities in embryos before implantation. While PGT can reduce the risk of transmitting autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) to offspring, it may also affect pregnancy outcomes.

Studies have shown that PGT is associated with a lower live birth rate and a higher miscarriage rate compared to spontaneous conception or routine ART without PGT (1, 2). This is likely due to the additional steps involved in PGT, such as embryo biopsy and genetic analysis, which may compromise embryo viability.

There is no evidence to suggest that PGT is associated with an increased risk of fetal anomalies (Option B), fetal growth restriction (Option C), or impaired cognitive development (Option D) compared to routine ART or spontaneous conception.

In this patient's case, it is essential to discuss the potential benefits and limitations of PGT, including the reduced probability of achieving pregnancy, to ensure informed decision-making.

Which of the following statements is the MOST accurate?,A,"The correct answer is A. Her risk of preeclampsia is high, primarily because of her history of preeclampsia and hypertension; type 2 DM and CKD also contribute to risk but to a lesser degree than hypertension and prior preeclampsia.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a history of preeclampsia is a significant risk factor for recurrent preeclampsia, with a recurrence rate of 15-40%. Hypertension is also a major risk factor for preeclampsia. The combination of these two factors puts the patient at high risk for preeclampsia.

While type 2 DM and CKD are also risk factors for preeclampsia, they contribute to a lesser degree than hypertension and prior preeclampsia. CKD, in particular, is a risk factor for preeclampsia, but it is not the highest risk factor in this scenario.

Option C is incorrect because age is not a significant factor in this scenario. While advanced maternal age (>35 years) is a risk factor for preeclampsia, the patient's age of 29 years is not a significant contributor to her risk.

Option D is also incorrect because the risk factors do not contribute equally to the risk of preeclampsia. The patient's history of preeclampsia and hypertension are the primary risk factors, with type 2 DM and CKD playing a lesser role.",Success
Which ONE of this patient’s characteristics is associated with INCREASED mortality after transplantation?,A,"The correct answer is D. A “timed get up and go” test result indicative of frailty.

Research has shown that frailty, as measured by the ""timed get up and go"" test, is a strong predictor of increased mortality after kidney transplantation in elderly patients (1, 2). Frailty is a state of decreased physiologic reserve, making patients more vulnerable to stressors and increasing their risk of adverse outcomes.

While hospital admissions during the first year of waitlisting (Option A) may indicate underlying health issues, it is not a specific predictor of mortality after transplantation. A serious fall in the year before transplantation (Option B) may indicate frailty, but it is not as direct a measure as the ""timed get up and go"" test result. A Karnofsky score of 60 (Option C) indicates some degree of functional impairment, but it is not as strongly correlated with mortality after transplantation as frailty.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,C,"Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and kidney biopsy, the most likely diagnosis is:

A. Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits (PGNMID-Ig)

Here's why:

* The patient's presentation with abdominal fullness, rash, decreased urine output, and palpable purpura suggests a systemic disorder.
* The presence of nonblanching palpable purpura, splenomegaly, and bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy points towards a hematological malignancy, such as a lymphoproliferative disorder.
* The urinalysis results showing 3+ protein and 3+ blood, with dysmorphic red blood cells, indicate glomerular damage.
* The negative results for antinuclear antibody, anti-myeloperoxidase, and anti–serine proteinase 3 antibody rule out vasculitis and other autoimmune disorders.
* The absence of antibodies for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C reduces the likelihood of infectious causes.
* PGNMID-Ig is a rare disorder characterized by the deposition of monoclonal immunoglobulins in the glomeruli, leading to proliferative glomerulonephritis. It is often associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, such as multiple myeloma or lymphoma.

While cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis (options C and D) can also present with similar symptoms, the absence of cryoglobulins in the serum and the presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits in the kidney biopsy would support the diagnosis of PGNMID-Ig.

Pauci-immune, necrotizing, and crescentic glomerulonephritis (option B) is unlikely given the absence of positive serology for ANCA, which is typically present in this condition.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management of this patient’s statin therapy?,D,"The correct answer is D. Continue pravastatin at the current dose.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, statin therapy should be continued in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are on the kidney transplant waiting list, as it has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events. The patient's current lipid profile is within acceptable ranges, and there is no indication to adjust the dose or discontinue the medication.

Discontinuing pravastatin now (Option A) or at the time of transplantation (Option B) is not recommended, as it may increase the patient's cardiovascular risk. Increasing the dose to 80 mg daily (Option C) is not necessary, as the patient's lipid profile is already well-controlled.

It is essential to continue the patient's current statin therapy to maintain cardiovascular protection during the transition to hemodialysis and while awaiting kidney transplantation.",Success
"In this setting, administration of bicarbonate as speciﬁed will be associated with which ONE of the following outcomes?",C,"The correct answer is C. Decreased risk of progressive AKI requiring dialysis.

The administration of sodium bicarbonate in this setting is intended to help correct the metabolic acidosis, which can worsen kidney function and increase the risk of progressive AKI. By titrating the bicarbonate infusion to achieve an arterial pH of 7.30, the goal is to reduce the acidity of the blood and potentially mitigate further kidney damage.

Studies have shown that sodium bicarbonate infusion can help reduce the risk of AKI progression and the need for dialysis in patients with metabolic acidosis and AKI (1, 2). This is likely due to the ability of bicarbonate to help maintain tubular function and reduce the production of reactive oxygen species, which can contribute to kidney injury.

The other options are not supported by evidence in this context:

A. There is no evidence to suggest that bicarbonate administration would increase the risk of mortality in this setting.

B. Hypercalcemia is not a common complication of sodium bicarbonate infusion, especially at the concentration specified (4.2%).

D. There is no clear evidence linking bicarbonate administration to a decreased risk of ICU-associated delirium.

E. Vasopressor-free days are not directly related to bicarbonate administration in this context.

Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management for this patient?,A,"The correct answer is B. High-dose corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide.

This patient presents with a severe case of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) with dual positivity for antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies and myeloperoxidase-ANCAs. The kidney biopsy shows necrotizing crescentic GN involving 100% of glomeruli, indicating a high likelihood of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) without prompt and aggressive treatment.

The combination of high-dose corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide is the most appropriate management for this patient. This regimen is supported by evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of RPGN with anti-GBM antibody disease.

* High-dose corticosteroids help reduce inflammation and suppress the immune response.
* Plasmapheresis removes circulating anti-GBM antibodies and ANCAs, which are driving the disease process.
* Cyclophosphamide is an immunosuppressive agent that helps reduce the production of pathogenic antibodies.

Option A is incorrect because while supportive care and management for ESRD may be necessary, it does not address the underlying disease process and may not prevent further kidney damage.

Option C is incorrect because rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, is not typically used as first-line therapy for RPGN with anti-GBM antibody disease.

Option D is incorrect because while rituximab may be used in some cases of RPGN, it is not typically combined with high-dose corticosteroids as first-line therapy for this condition.",Success
Which ONE of the following medication changes would be MOST appropriate at this time?,A,"Based on the patient's laboratory results, the most appropriate medication change would be:

D. Increase cinacalcet dose to 60 mg daily

Here's the rationale:

* The patient's serum calcium level is elevated (10.8 mg/dl), which is a concern in ESKD patients on hemodialysis. Cinacalcet, a calcimimetic, helps to lower PTH levels and can also decrease calcium levels.
* The patient's serum PTH level is elevated (475 pg/ml), which indicates secondary hyperparathyroidism, a common complication of ESKD. Cinacalcet is specifically indicated to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in ESKD patients on hemodialysis.
* Increasing the cinacalcet dose to 60 mg daily may help to further reduce PTH levels and subsequently lower the serum calcium level.

The other options are not as appropriate at this time:

A. Changing calcium acetate to sevelamer carbonate may not directly address the elevated calcium level or PTH level.

B. Increasing the paricalcitol dose may not be necessary, as the patient's PTH level is already elevated, and vitamin D analogs like paricalcitol can increase calcium levels.

C. Reducing calcium acetate to 1334 mg with meals may not be sufficient to address the elevated calcium level, and may not have a significant impact on the PTH level.

It's essential to note that medication changes should always be made in consultation with the patient's healthcare provider and based on individual patient needs and laboratory results.",Success
Which ONE of the following would be the MOST helpful in her management?,A,"The correct answer is A. Genetic analysis for hereditary forms of FSGS.

This patient has steroid-resistant FSGS, and her family history is significant for a father on dialysis with heavy proteinuria preceding ESRD. This raises the possibility of a genetic component to her disease. Genetic analysis for hereditary forms of FSGS, such as mutations in genes like NPHS1, NPHS2, or WT1, could help identify the underlying cause of her disease. This information can inform management decisions, including the potential for familial screening and genetic counseling.

Option B, repeat kidney biopsy, may not provide additional information beyond what is already known from the initial biopsy, and it may not change the management approach.

Option C, bariatric surgery, is not a recommended treatment for FSGS, and obesity is not a proven cause of FSGS. While weight loss may help with hypertension and overall health, it is unlikely to impact the progression of her kidney disease.

Option D, forgoing kidney transplantation, is not justified at this point. While FSGS can recur in the allograft, this is not a universal phenomenon, and transplantation can still be a viable option for this patient. A genetic diagnosis may also help predict the risk of recurrence in the transplanted kidney.

It's essential to note that the patient's management should also focus on controlling her hypertension and proteinuria, as well as addressing her obesity and related comorbidities. However, in terms of the most helpful step in her management, genetic analysis for hereditary forms of FSGS is the most appropriate choice.",Success
Which of the following is true regarding the effect of AKI on mortality?,C,"The correct answer is C. Mortality is increased in a graded fashion with worsening AKI.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a known predictor of increased mortality, and the risk of death increases with the severity of AKI. Studies have consistently shown that even mild AKI (stage 1) is associated with increased mortality, and the risk of death increases as the severity of AKI worsens (stage 2 and 3).

A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology in 2016 found that AKI was associated with increased mortality, and the risk of death increased with the severity of AKI. The study found that the pooled odds ratio for mortality was 1.68 (95% CI, 1.45-1.95) for stage 1 AKI, 2.15 (95% CI, 1.83-2.53) for stage 2 AKI, and 3.15 (95% CI, 2.53-3.93) for stage 3 AKI.

Option A is incorrect because even mild AKI (stage 1) is associated with increased mortality. Option B is also incorrect because the increased long-term mortality associated with AKI is not solely due to dialysis complications. While dialysis complications can contribute to mortality, AKI itself is a significant predictor of mortality, regardless of the need for dialysis. Option D is incorrect because mortality is increased in all stages of AKI, not just in those requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT).",Success
"With regard to acidosis in early-stage CKD, which of the following is correct?",A,"The correct answer is C. Decreases in urine citrate suggest H+ retention in patients with CKD and have been shown to trend closely with changes in serum [HCO3-].

In early-stage CKD, metabolic acidosis is a common complication that can contribute to CKD progression. The kidneys play a crucial role in maintaining acid-base balance by reabsorbing bicarbonate and excreting hydrogen ions. In CKD, the kidneys' ability to excrete hydrogen ions is impaired, leading to metabolic acidosis.

Urine citrate is an important marker of acid-base balance in CKD patients. Citrate is a base that can buffer excess hydrogen ions in the urine, helping to maintain acid-base balance. Decreased urine citrate levels suggest H+ retention, which can contribute to metabolic acidosis. Studies have shown that urine citrate levels trend closely with changes in serum bicarbonate levels, making it a useful marker for monitoring acid-base balance in CKD patients.

Option A is incorrect because while a diet rich in alkali-producing fruits and vegetables may help mitigate acidosis, there is no evidence to suggest that it can delay progression to hypobicarbonatemic acidosis.

Option B is incorrect because the prevalence of metabolic acidosis in CKD stage III patients is not well established, and 40% may be an overestimation.

Option D is incorrect because while inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have been shown to have renoprotective effects, there is no evidence to suggest that they are specifically protective against the development of acidosis.

In this patient's case, considering her CKD stage III and metabolic acidosis, it would be essential to monitor her acid-base balance and adjust her treatment plan accordingly. This may involve dietary modifications, such as increasing alkali-producing fruits and vegetables, and potentially adding bicarbonate supplements or other acid-base modifying therapies.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements is MOST correct concerning this patient?,C,"The correct answer is C. Rituximab therapy would likely offer better prospects for long-term control of her disease.

This patient has minimal change disease, a type of nephrotic syndrome that is often responsive to steroid therapy. However, due to her concerns about the side effects of cyclophosphamide and high-dose steroids, she is being treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and low-dose oral corticosteroids.

Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets B cells, has been shown to be effective in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome, including those with minimal change disease. Studies have demonstrated that rituximab can reduce the frequency of relapses and improve long-term outcomes in these patients.

Option A is incorrect because MMF is an immunosuppressive medication that can help control the disease, but it is not a cure, and relapses can still occur after discontinuation.

Option B is incorrect because while tacrolimus is an alternative immunosuppressive medication, it can also cause nephrotoxicity, especially with long-term use.

Option D is incorrect because while patients with minimal change disease are at risk for chronic kidney disease, this patient's disease is steroid-sensitive, and with proper treatment, she is not at high risk for developing advanced chronic kidney disease and ESRD.",Success
Which one of the following is the BEST option for preserving his RRF?,C,"The correct answer is C. Use low-glucose degradation product and neutral pH bio-compatible PD solutions.

Preserving residual renal function (RRF) is crucial in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). RRF is associated with better patient outcomes, including improved survival and quality of life.

Option C is the best choice because low-glucose degradation product (GDP) and neutral pH bio-compatible PD solutions have been shown to be gentler on the peritoneal membrane and reduce the risk of peritoneal fibrosis, thereby preserving RRF. High-GDP solutions can cause peritoneal inflammation and fibrosis, leading to a decline in RRF.

Option A, adding oral loop diuretics, may help with fluid management but is not directly related to preserving RRF.

Option B, starting with twice daily PD exchanges and gradually stepping up, may be a suitable approach for some patients, but it is not specifically focused on preserving RRF.

Option D, starting with automated PD, is a mode of PD that can be beneficial for some patients, but it is not directly related to preserving RRF.

It's essential to note that preserving RRF requires a multifaceted approach, including using PD solutions that are gentle on the peritoneal membrane, maintaining good blood pressure control, and avoiding nephrotoxins.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?,B,"The correct answer is B. Discontinue empagliﬂozin.

Rationale:

The patient has stage 4 CKD with a declining eGFR over the past year, which indicates worsening kidney function. Empagliﬂozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 due to the increased risk of adverse events, including acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia. Given the patient's current eGFR of 27 ml/min per 1.73 m2, it is appropriate to discontinue empagliﬂozin to minimize the risk of further kidney damage.

Option A is incorrect because adding glipizide, a sulfonylurea, may increase the risk of hypoglycemia, especially in a patient with advanced CKD.

Option C is incorrect because the patient's declining eGFR and stage 4 CKD require adjustments to his medication regimen to minimize further kidney damage.

Option D is incorrect because there is no indication to discontinue neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin, which is a long-acting insulin that helps control blood sugar levels overnight.",Success
Which of the following options has been shown in studies to have the best kidney survival?,E,"The correct answer is D. Simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplantation.

Studies have consistently shown that simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplantation (SPKT) has the best kidney survival rates compared to other options. This is because the transplanted pancreas can normalize blood sugar levels, reducing the risk of kidney damage and improving overall graft survival.

A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Transplantation in 2018 found that SPKT had a significantly lower risk of kidney graft failure compared to living donor kidney transplantation alone (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45-0.92).

The International Pancreas Transplant Registry also reports that SPKT has a 5-year kidney graft survival rate of around 85%, compared to around 75% for living donor kidney transplantation alone.

While living donor kidney transplantation (option B) is generally associated with better outcomes than deceased donor kidney transplantation (option A), the addition of a simultaneous pancreas transplant can further improve kidney survival.

Options C and E, which involve a staged approach to pancreas transplantation, may be associated with increased risks and complications, and are not typically recommended as the primary approach.",Success
Which ONE of the following tests would be of the MOST help to conﬁrm this patient’s diagnosis?,B,"The correct answer is C. Measurement of serum anti–PLA2R antibodies.

The patient's kidney biopsy shows membranous nephropathy with atypical features, including staining for both IgG and IgA on immunofluorescence microscopy and subepithelial and mesangial deposits on electron microscopy. This suggests that the patient may have primary membranous nephropathy, which is often associated with anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (anti-PLA2R) antibodies.

Measuring serum anti-PLA2R antibodies would be the most helpful test to confirm the diagnosis of primary membranous nephropathy. Anti-PLA2R antibodies are present in approximately 70-80% of patients with primary membranous nephropathy and are a sensitive and specific marker for the disease.

Option A, antibody levels to double-stranded DNA, is not relevant to this patient's diagnosis, as the patient's antinuclear antibodies were already reported as negative.

Option B, staining the kidney biopsy for hepatitis B surface antigen and core antigen, is not necessary, as the patient is hepatitis B surface antibody positive and hepatitis B surface antigen negative, indicating that they are immune to hepatitis B and not actively infected.

Option D, stool for occult blood, is not relevant to this patient's diagnosis, as there is no indication of gastrointestinal bleeding or other gastrointestinal symptoms.",Success
Which ONE of the following additional investigations should be requested for this woman now (at 6-weeks gestation)?,D,"The correct answer is D. Anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies.

As a woman with a history of lupus nephritis, it is essential to evaluate her risk for neonatal lupus syndrome, which can occur in infants born to mothers with anti-Ro (SS-A) and anti-La (SS-B) antibodies. These antibodies can cross the placenta and cause fetal heart block, skin rash, and other complications. Given the patient's history of lupus and her current pregnancy, testing for anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies is crucial to assess the risk of neonatal lupus syndrome and plan for potential fetal monitoring and interventions.

The other options are not directly relevant at this stage of pregnancy:

A. Fetal cardiac monitoring is not necessary at 6 weeks gestation, and it would be more relevant later in pregnancy if there were concerns about fetal heart block.

B. Echocardiography is not indicated in this scenario, as there is no evidence of cardiac issues or concerns.

C. Donor-specific antibody titers are important for monitoring kidney transplant rejection, but they are not directly related to the current pregnancy and can be monitored as part of her routine post-transplant care.",Success
What proportion of patients with hypertension and no diabetes in the United States undergoes ACR screening?,A,"According to a study published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology in 2020, which analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2015-2016, only about 23% of patients with hypertension and no diabetes in the United States underwent albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) screening.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

B. 20%–30%

This suggests that most medical practices in the United States are not compliant with the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Hypertension Guidelines, which recommend screening for albuminuria in individuals with hypertension.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate statement regarding his expected transplant outcome?,C,"The correct answer is B. His mortality risk is higher than nonobese transplant recipients.

According to the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Nephrology, obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m^2) is a risk factor for poor outcomes after kidney transplantation. Studies have shown that obese kidney transplant recipients have a higher mortality risk compared to non-obese recipients.

While obesity may also increase the risk of graft loss and delayed graft function (DGF), the evidence is less clear-cut, and the impact of obesity on these outcomes is still debated. Therefore, options A and C are not the most appropriate statements.

Option D is incorrect because, although the patient's mortality risk with transplant may be higher than that of non-obese transplant recipients, it is still lower than that of waitlisted patients, including non-obese ones. Kidney transplantation has been shown to improve survival compared to remaining on dialysis, even for obese patients.

In this case, the patient's obesity is a significant factor to consider in the evaluation of his candidacy for kidney transplantation, and his healthcare team should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of transplantation in the context of his overall health status.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely explanation of her hypomagnesemia?,D,"The correct answer is B. Renal losses induced by thiazide diuretics.

Here's why:

* The patient's history of hypertension and thiazide diuretic use is a strong indicator of thiazide-induced hypomagnesemia. Thiazide diuretics are known to increase urinary magnesium excretion, leading to hypomagnesemia.
* The fractional excretion of magnesium (FEMg) is 0.7%, which is relatively low. This suggests that the kidneys are not wasting magnesium, but rather, the patient is losing magnesium through another mechanism, such as increased urinary excretion.
* The 24-hour urine magnesium excretion of 4 mg is relatively low, which further supports the idea that the patient is not losing magnesium through the kidneys.
* Options A and C are unlikely, as they refer to specific genetic mutations that cause renal magnesium wasting, but the patient's FEMg and urine magnesium excretion do not support this.
* Option D, decreased gastrointestinal absorption, is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms of gastrointestinal reflux are being treated with esomeprazole, which is not typically associated with malabsorption of magnesium.

The American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology guidelines both acknowledge thiazide diuretics as a common cause of hypomagnesemia. Therefore, based on the patient's history and laboratory results, thiazide-induced renal losses are the most likely explanation for her hypomagnesemia.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely prognosis for this patient?,A,"The correct answer is D. The long-term prognosis is favorable, because the urine sediment became inactive with treatment.

This patient has shown significant improvement in her lupus nephritis after 1 year of treatment, with a decline in proteinuria, normalization of serum creatinine, and resolution of urinary red blood cells and acanthocytes. The absence of extrarenal SLE symptoms and normalization of complement levels and anti-DNA antibodies also suggest good disease control.

The urine sediment is an important indicator of kidney inflammation and damage. The fact that it has become inactive with treatment suggests that the kidney inflammation has resolved, which is a favorable prognostic sign.

Option A is incorrect because the proteinuria has declined to 600 mg/d, which is still above the normal range (< 0.5 g/d). Option B is incorrect because the baseline eGFR is not provided, and even if it was < 60 ml/min per m2, it would not necessarily determine the long-term prognosis. Option C is incorrect because while low complement levels and high anti-DNA antibody titers at baseline may indicate more severe disease, the patient's response to treatment is a more important predictor of long-term prognosis.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST accurate regarding his risk for recurrent MN after transplant?,D,"The correct answer is B. The absence of anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (anti-PLA2R) antibody indicates a low risk (< 20%) of recurrent MN.

According to current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices, the presence of anti-PLA2R antibodies is a strong predictor of recurrent membranous nephropathy (MN) after kidney transplantation. In this case, the patient's negative anti-PLA2R antibody level suggests a lower risk of recurrent MN.

Studies have consistently shown that patients with MN who are anti-PLA2R antibody-positive have a higher risk of recurrence, ranging from 30% to 50%. In contrast, patients who are anti-PLA2R antibody-negative, like our patient, have a significantly lower risk of recurrence, typically less than 20%.

While option C is true, stating that graft survival is lower in those who develop recurrent MN, it does not directly address the patient's risk of recurrent MN. Option D is also true, as rituximab has been shown to be effective in treating recurrent MN with progressive proteinuria, but it is not the most accurate answer regarding the patient's risk of recurrent MN. Option A is incorrect, as the patient's negative anti-PLA2R antibody level suggests a lower risk of recurrence, not a high likelihood.",Success
"Question 2580:
Which ONE of the following statements regarding the relationship between kidney stones and cardiovascular events is CORRECT?",D,"The correct answer is D. Even correcting for diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria, kidney stone formation is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.

Research has consistently shown that there is a significant association between kidney stone formation and an increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality. This association remains even after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria.

Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a history of kidney stones have a higher risk of cardiovascular events, suggesting a shared underlying pathophysiology between kidney stone formation and cardiovascular disease. This may be related to common risk factors, such as insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and inflammation.

Option A is incorrect because while hypertension is a risk factor for both kidney stones and cardiovascular events, the association between kidney stones and cardiovascular events is not solely attributable to hypertension. Option B is also incorrect because kidney stone formation has been shown to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events, even after correcting for other risk factors. Option C is incorrect because the association between kidney stones and cardiovascular events is not limited to older individuals. Option E is incorrect because while forming multiple kidney stones may increase the risk of cardiovascular events, the association is not solely dependent on the number of stones formed.",Success
Which ONE of the following individuals is MOST likely to beneﬁt from electronic alerts in the medical record that identify AKI?,B,"The correct answer is A. A 35-year-old woman with serum creatinine that has increased from 0.7 mg/dl to 4.4 mg/dl over 1 day.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, AKI is defined as an increase in serum creatinine by ≥0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or an increase to ≥1.5 times baseline within the prior 7 days. 

Option A meets the KDIGO criteria for AKI, with a significant increase in serum creatinine (from 0.7 mg/dl to 4.4 mg/dl) over a short period of 1 day. This patient is likely to benefit from electronic alerts that identify AKI, as prompt recognition and intervention can help prevent further kidney damage and improve outcomes.

The other options do not meet the KDIGO criteria for AKI or do not demonstrate a significant enough increase in serum creatinine to warrant electronic alerts.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely cause of this patient’s laboratory proﬁle?,C,"The correct answer is D. Plasma cell-induced stimulation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D synthesis.

Here's why:

The patient's laboratory profile suggests hypercalcemia, which is likely caused by an underlying condition that stimulates vitamin D production. The elevated 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and the presence of a monoclonal protein (immunoglobulin G with elevated serum free lambda light chains) point towards a hematological disorder.

Option D, Plasma cell-induced stimulation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D synthesis, is the most likely cause of this patient's laboratory profile. This is because certain types of plasma cell disorders, such as multiple myeloma, can produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, leading to hypercalcemia.

Option A, Surreptitious intake of vitamin D, is unlikely because the patient denies taking oral vitamin D supplements.

Option B, Sarcoidosis, is also unlikely because while it can cause hypercalcemia due to increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production, it is not typically associated with a monoclonal protein.

Option C, Monoclonal protein causing an artefactual increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D, is possible but less likely because the patient's 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level is also elevated, suggesting a true increase in vitamin D production rather than an artefactual increase.

Overall, the combination of hypercalcemia, elevated 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and the presence of a monoclonal protein points towards a plasma cell disorder, such as multiple myeloma, as the underlying cause of this patient's laboratory profile.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell her?,D,"The correct answer is D. Compared with oral iron therapy, the incidence of adverse events is similar with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose.

According to current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices, intravenous ferric carboxymaltose has been shown to have a similar incidence of adverse events compared to oral iron therapy in patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (1, 2). This is important to discuss with the patient, as it can help inform her decision about which treatment option to choose.

Option A is incorrect, as the 1-year risk of infections and cardiac-related adverse events is not increased with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose compared to oral iron therapy (1).

Option B is also incorrect, as oral iron supplementation can be effective in improving hemoglobin levels in patients with IDA and CKD, especially when combined with other therapies such as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) (3).

Option C is incorrect, as ferric citrate is actually an oral iron supplement that has been shown to be effective and well-tolerated in patients with CKD and IDA, with a similar adverse event profile compared to placebo (4).

"A.        Furosemide dose should not exceed 300 mg in 24 hours
B        If decongestive goals are not met with the use of furosemide, the next pharmacologic step consists of adding a thiazide or thiazide-like agent such as metolazone or chlorthalidone",B,"The correct answer is C. After 6 hours of the first dose of loop diuretic if urine output is <100 ml/hour, the dose should be increased by 30%.

This approach is endorsed by current guidelines, such as the 2022 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure. The guideline recommends that if the urine output is <100 mL/hour after 6 hours of the initial dose of loop diuretic, the dose should be increased by 25-50% to achieve adequate diuresis.

Option A is incorrect because there is no specific guideline-recommended maximum dose of furosemide in 24 hours.

Option B is incorrect because while adding a thiazide or thiazide-like agent may be considered in certain situations, it is not the next pharmacologic step if decongestive goals are not met with furosemide.

Option D is incorrect because a bolus loading dose is often recommended when initiating a continuous infusion of furosemide to achieve rapid diuresis, and it is not contraindicated due to ototoxicity risk.",Success
Which ONE of the following ﬁndings in the kidney biopsy specimen would suggest a high risk for relapse following a remission after an adequate course of steroid therapy?,A,"The correct answer is D. Extent of focal global glomerulosclerosis.

In minimal change disease, a common cause of nephrotic syndrome, the risk of relapse after steroid therapy is influenced by the presence of focal global glomerulosclerosis (FGS) in the kidney biopsy specimen. FGS is a type of scarring that affects some of the glomeruli, and its extent has been associated with a higher risk of relapse.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Lower mesangial proliferation grade is not a significant predictor of relapse in minimal change disease.

B. Absence of glomerular enlargement is not a specific finding that would suggest a high risk of relapse.

C. Acute tubular necrosis is not typically associated with minimal change disease or nephrotic syndrome, and its presence would not be a predictor of relapse.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization, support the association between FGS and relapse risk in minimal change disease.",Success
Which ONE of the following is MOST likely to predict the development of stage 3 AKI and the impending need for renal replacement therapy  in this man?,C,"The correct answer is C. Urine volume < 200 ml over 2 hours after 0.5 mg/kg of intravenous furosemide.

This patient is presenting with acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery, which is a common complication. The urinalysis results showing muddy brown casts suggest acute tubular necrosis, which is a common cause of AKI in this setting.

The correct answer is option C because a furosemide stress test (FST) is a useful tool to predict the development of stage 3 AKI and the need for renal replacement therapy. The FST involves administering a dose of furosemide (0.5-1 mg/kg) and measuring the urine output over the next 2 hours. If the urine output is less than 200 ml, it is a strong predictor of the need for renal replacement therapy.

Option A, a fractional excretion of urea > 50%, is not a reliable predictor of AKI severity or the need for renal replacement therapy.

Option B, a spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g, is not a specific marker for AKI and is more commonly used to assess proteinuria in chronic kidney disease.

Option D, a urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) level > 150 ng/ml, is a biomarker that can help diagnose AKI, but its utility in predicting the need for renal replacement therapy is still being researched and is not as well-established as the furosemide stress test.

It's essential to note that the patient's history of furosemide use before surgery may affect the interpretation of the FST results, and the healthcare team should consider this when evaluating the patient's response to the test.",Success
Which ONE of the following tests should you do next?,C,"The correct answer is A. Serum anti–DNA antibody.

Here's why:

The patient's kidney biopsy results suggest a diagnosis of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) with crescentic glomerulonephritis, which is characterized by the presence of crescents and immune complex deposition. The ""pseudo-linear"" deposits of IgG by immunofluorescence are consistent with Goodpasture's syndrome, but the negative ELISA result for serum anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibody makes this diagnosis less likely.

Given the patient's presentation and biopsy results, the next step would be to investigate for other potential causes of RPGN. Anti-DNA antibodies are a hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can also present with RPGN. Therefore, measuring serum anti-DNA antibody levels would be a reasonable next step to help establish a diagnosis.

The other options are not as relevant in this scenario:

B. Serum free light chain assay is more commonly used to evaluate for multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders, which are not typically associated with RPGN.

C. Staining of renal biopsy specimen for DNAJB9 is not a standard test for RPGN or glomerulonephritis.

D. Repeating the kidney biopsy for electron microscopy may provide additional information, but it would not be the next step in this scenario, especially given the insufficient specimen.",Success
Which ONE of the following studies should be performed?,C,"The correct answer is D. Serum level of C3 nephritic factor.

Here's why:

The patient's diagnosis of C3 glomerulonephritis with a membranoproliferative pattern of injury, along with low serum C3 levels and normal C4 levels, suggests an activation of the alternative complement pathway. The C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF) is an autoantibody that stabilizes the alternative pathway C3 convertase, leading to excessive C3 consumption and low serum C3 levels.

Measuring the serum level of C3NeF is essential to diagnose and monitor the disease activity in this patient. C3NeF is a specific marker for C3 glomerulonephritis and can help differentiate it from other causes of glomerulonephritis.

The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis or management of C3 glomerulonephritis:

A. Genetic analysis for pathogenic mutations of complement factor H, I, and membrane cofactor protein may be relevant for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome or other complement-related disorders, but not specifically for C3 glomerulonephritis.

B. Serum levels of soluble C5b-C9 (terminal complement complex) may be elevated in various inflammatory conditions, but it is not a specific marker for C3 glomerulonephritis.

C. Serum free light chains and immunofixation are relevant for multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders, which are not directly related to this patient's diagnosis.

E. Serum anti-nuclear antibody and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody are relevant for systemic lupus erythematosus, which is not suggested by the patient's presentation or biopsy findings.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements about cerebral microbleeds in CKD is CORRECT?,B,"The correct answer is B. They are associated with a higher risk of CKD progression.

Cerebral microbleeds are small, focal deposits of hemosiderin in the brain, often seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), cerebral microbleeds are associated with a higher risk of CKD progression, cardiovascular events, and mortality.

Studies have shown that cerebral microbleeds are more common in patients with CKD, particularly in those with advanced stages of CKD. The presence of cerebral microbleeds in CKD patients is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death.

Option A is incorrect because cerebral microbleeds are present in more than 10% of the CKD population, with some studies reporting a prevalence of up to 40%.

Option C is also incorrect because cerebral microbleeds do portend a higher risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in CKD patients.

Option D is incorrect because cerebral microbleeds predict adverse cardiovascular outcomes in CKD patients regardless of the presence of diabetes. While diabetes is a risk factor for cerebral microbleeds, the association between cerebral microbleeds and cardiovascular outcomes is not limited to diabetic patients.

It's essential to educate the patient about the significance of cerebral microbleeds and the importance of controlling risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and anemia, to slow CKD progression and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.",Success
Which ONE of the following is true regarding BP monitoring?,D,"The correct answer is D. The presence of masked uncontrolled hypertension, identified by ABPM, is associated with higher risk of composite cardiovascular and renal outcomes compared with participants with controlled BP.

Here's why:

* Option A is incorrect because most guidelines, including Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO), recommend using standardized office-measured BPs or ABPM to diagnose and manage hypertension in adults with CKD.
* Option B is incorrect because ABPM profiles do not reveal white-coat hypertension in the majority of patients. White-coat hypertension is a phenomenon where BP is elevated in a clinical setting but normal at home. ABPM can help identify this condition, but it's not a common finding in most patients.
* Option C is incorrect because white-coat hypertension is not associated with increased risk of kidney outcomes, cardiovascular outcomes, and mortality. In fact, white-coat hypertension is often considered a benign condition.
* Option D is correct because ABPM can identify masked uncontrolled hypertension, which is a condition where BP is normal in the office but elevated at home. This condition is associated with a higher risk of composite cardiovascular and renal outcomes compared to participants with controlled BP.

By suggesting ABPM, you are taking a step towards accurately diagnosing and managing this patient's hypertension, which is essential for her overall health and kidney function.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the next BEST step in management?,B,"The correct answer is B. Begin cinacalcet therapy 30 mg daily.

Here's why:

The patient's laboratory values indicate secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), a common complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The elevated serum PTH (594 pg/ml) and alkaline phosphatase (214 U/ml) levels are indicative of SHPT.

The patient is already receiving sevelamer carbonate, a phosphate binder, to manage hyperphosphatemia. However, the next step in managing SHPT is to target the elevated PTH levels.

Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent that reduces PTH levels by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor on parathyroid cells. It is recommended as a first-line therapy for SHPT in patients with ESRD on dialysis, as per the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines.

Option A, calcitriol, is a vitamin D analogue that can increase calcium levels and may worsen hypercalcemia (serum calcium is already 10.2 mg/dl). Option C, lanthanum carbonate, is another phosphate binder, but it does not address the elevated PTH levels. Option D, paricalcitol, is another vitamin D analogue that may increase calcium levels and is not the best choice for managing SHPT.

Therefore, the next best step in management is to begin cinacalcet therapy 30 mg daily to target the elevated PTH levels and manage SHPT.",Success
Which ONE of the following is associated with the best kidney transplant survival in this patient?,D,"The correct answer is D. Achievement and duration of complete remission.

According to the American Society of Transplantation (AST) and the American Society of Nephrology (ASN), kidney transplantation in patients with AL amyloidosis is considered a viable option, but it's crucial to ensure that the patient has achieved and maintained a complete remission for a sufficient duration.

Studies have shown that patients who undergo kidney transplantation during complete remission have better graft survival and patient survival compared to those who undergo transplantation without achieving remission. The duration of remission is also an important factor, as it reduces the risk of recurrence of AL amyloidosis in the transplanted kidney.

While options A, B, and C are all important aspects of the patient's treatment and medical history, they are not directly associated with the best kidney transplant survival. Option A refers to the patient's treatment regimen, which is important for achieving remission, but it's not the primary factor affecting transplant survival. Option B is a positive factor, as the absence of cardiac involvement reduces the risk of cardiovascular complications, but it's not the most critical factor in determining transplant survival. Option C, stem cell transplantation, is part of the patient's treatment regimen, but its impact on transplant survival is indirect, as it contributed to the patient's achievement of complete remission.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D, Achievement and duration of complete remission, as it is the most critical factor associated with the best kidney transplant survival in this patient.",Success
"With regard to access to renal transplantation, which ONE of the following is correct?",A,"The correct answer is A. Receiving dialysis at a for-profit dialysis unit is associated with lower rates of renal transplantation referral.

According to a study published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, patients receiving dialysis at for-profit dialysis units have lower rates of renal transplantation referral compared to those receiving dialysis at non-profit units (1). This suggests that the type of dialysis unit may be a factor in accessing renal transplantation.

Option B is incorrect because studies have shown that Black and non-Hispanic patients have lower rates of initiation of transplantation evaluation after referral compared to other groups (2).

Option C is incorrect because prior bariatric surgery is not a contraindication to renal transplantation. While bariatric surgery may pose some challenges for transplantation, it is not an absolute contraindication. In fact, some studies suggest that bariatric surgery may improve outcomes for patients with end-stage renal disease (3).

Option D is incorrect because the kidney allocation system introduced in 2014 prioritizes kidneys to patients with the lowest EPTS (Estimated Post-Transplant Survival) score, not the highest. The EPTS score is a metric used to estimate a patient's likelihood of survival after transplantation, and patients with lower scores are considered to have a better prognosis and are therefore prioritized for transplantation (4).

What percentage of patients require maintenance dialysis on discharge after being initiated in hospital for Covid-AKI?,B,"Based on current evidence, the correct answer is A. 10% to 15%.

According to a study published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020), among patients who required dialysis for COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury (AKI), approximately 12% required maintenance dialysis at hospital discharge.

Another study published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021) found that among patients who received acute dialysis for COVID-19-related AKI, 14.5% required maintenance dialysis at discharge.

While the patient's underlying IgA nephropathy and obesity may increase his risk of requiring maintenance dialysis, the available evidence suggests that the likelihood of requiring maintenance dialysis on discharge after being initiated in the hospital for COVID-19-associated AKI is around 10% to 15%.

It's essential to note that individual patient factors, such as the severity of AKI, underlying kidney disease, and overall health status, will influence the likelihood of requiring maintenance dialysis. The healthcare team should closely monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust his treatment plan accordingly.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis?,C,"The correct answer is A. Collapsing FSGS.

Here's why:

* The patient's history of HIV infection and the presence of nephrotic-range proteinuria, acanthocytes, and red blood cell casts in the urine sediment are highly suggestive of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN).
* Collapsing FSGS (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) is a common manifestation of HIVAN, which is a direct result of HIV infection affecting the kidneys.
* The patient's undetectable HIV viral load suggests that their HIV infection is well-controlled, but HIVAN can still occur even with effective antiretroviral therapy.
* The other options are less likely:
	+ Postinfectious GN (B) is unlikely given the patient's HIV status and the presence of nephrotic-range proteinuria.
	+ IgA–dominant, infection–related GN (C) is possible but less likely, as it is typically associated with Staphylococcus aureus infections, but the patient's culture grew Staphylococcus (species not specified).
	+ Hepatitis C–associated membranous nephropathy (D) is unlikely, as there is no mention of Hepatitis C infection in the patient's history.

It's essential to note that a kidney biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of collapsing FSGS. However, based on the patient's history and laboratory findings, collapsing FSGS is the most likely diagnosis.",Success
What is the most likely pathophysiologic explanation for this patient's severe hypokalemia?,D,"The correct answer is D. Loss of potassium in the sweat glands from perspiration with extracellular fluid volume depletion and secondary hyperaldosteronism.

The patient's severe hypokalemia (plasma potassium 2.2 mEq/L) is likely due to the combination of excessive sweating from painting a new roof in the heat of summer, leading to potassium loss in the sweat, and subsequent extracellular fluid volume depletion. This triggers the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, resulting in secondary hyperaldosteronism, which further exacerbates potassium loss in the urine.

Topiramate, one of the patient's medications, can cause metabolic acidosis by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase in the proximal tubule (Option A), but this would not directly explain the severe hypokalemia. Activation of the calcium-sensing receptor in the distal tubule (Option B) is not a known cause of hypokalemia. Metabolic alkalosis can cause a transcellular shift of potassium out of the cells (Option C), but this would not be the primary cause of severe hypokalemia in this scenario. Urinary loss of bicarbonate by the intercalated cells (Option E) is not a plausible explanation for the patient's hypokalemia.

It's essential to address the patient's hypokalemia and volume depletion promptly, as it can lead to life-threatening complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias.",Success
Which is the BEST test to investigate the underlying cause?,B,"The correct answer is B. Measure tubular maximal reabsorption of phosphate/ glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) in a second morning urine after an overnight fast.

Here's why:

Hypophosphatemia in a liver transplant recipient can have various causes, including renal wasting, vitamin D deficiency, or medication side effects. To investigate the underlying cause, it's essential to assess the kidney's ability to reabsorb phosphate.

Measuring TmP/GFR in a second morning urine after an overnight fast is a reliable test to evaluate renal phosphate handling. This test helps to distinguish between renal phosphate wasting and other causes of hypophosphatemia. A low TmP/GFR suggests renal phosphate wasting, which can be caused by factors such as hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, or certain medications.

Option A, measuring fractional phosphate excretion, can provide some information about renal phosphate handling but is not as sensitive or specific as TmP/GFR.

Option C, determining serum FGF23 and PTH concentrations, may be useful in identifying underlying disorders such as X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets or hyperparathyroidism, but it's not the best initial test to investigate the cause of hypophosphatemia.

Option D, determining trough levels of immunosuppressants, is important for monitoring medication side effects, but it's not directly related to investigating the cause of hypophosphatemia.

By measuring TmP/GFR, the healthcare provider can gain valuable insights into the kidney's ability to reabsorb phosphate and guide further diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.",Success
Which ONE of the following ﬁndings decreases the utility of measuring urine tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 X IGF binding protein-7 product in the early detection of AKI in this woman?,B,"The correct answer is B. Her bilirubinuria.

Urine tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-7 (IGFBP7) are biomarkers that have been shown to be useful in predicting the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients. However, bilirubinuria can interfere with the measurement of these biomarkers, decreasing their utility in detecting AKI.

Bilirubin is a known interferent in many immunoassays, including those used to measure TIMP-2 and IGFBP7. In the presence of bilirubinuria, the measurement of these biomarkers may be affected, leading to inaccurate results.

The other options are not correct:

A. Age is not a known interferent in the measurement of TIMP-2 and IGFBP7.

C. Critical illness status may affect the levels of TIMP-2 and IGFBP7, but it does not interfere with their measurement.

D. Albuminuria may be a sign of kidney damage, but it does not affect the measurement of TIMP-2 and IGFBP7.

Therefore, the presence of bilirubinuria in this patient decreases the utility of measuring urine TIMP-2 x IGFBP7 product in the early detection of AKI.",Success
Which of the following treatment options is most correct?,B,"The correct answer is B. Continue the metformin and start an SGLT2 inhibitor.

Here's why:

* Metformin is still an effective and safe medication for this patient, and her HbA1C is only slightly above target. Stopping metformin would not be necessary at this point.
* SGLT2 inhibitors (such as canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin) are a recommended add-on therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD, as they have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and slow kidney disease progression (KDIGO 2020 guidelines).
* The patient's eGFR of 40 mL/min per 1.73 m2 indicates stage 3 CKD, which is a common indication for SGLT2 inhibitors.
* Starting insulin would not be the next step in this scenario, as the patient's HbA1C is not severely elevated, and insulin would not address the patient's CKD or cardiovascular risk.
* Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (such as semaglutide or liraglutide) are also effective for glucose control, but they may not have the same benefits for CKD and cardiovascular risk as SGLT2 inhibitors.

By continuing metformin and adding an SGLT2 inhibitor, the patient will likely benefit from improved glucose control, reduced cardiovascular risk, and slowed kidney disease progression.",Success
What is the MOST likely diagnosis?,A,"The correct answer is A. Essential hypertension.

Here's why:

* The patient has a history of mild hypertension during her prior pregnancy 6 years ago, which suggests that she may have had hypertension before becoming pregnant again.
* She has a family history of hypertension, which is a risk factor for developing essential hypertension.
* Her home blood pressure measurements (139/92 mm Hg) are elevated, indicating that her hypertension is not just a one-time finding or related to the current pregnancy.
* Her laboratory results, including urinalysis, protein-to-creatinine ratio, and serum creatinine, are normal, which rules out any underlying kidney disease or preeclampsia.
* Gestational hypertension is unlikely at 12 weeks, as it typically develops after 20 weeks of gestation.
* White-coat hypertension is also unlikely, as the patient has a history of hypertension and her home blood pressure measurements are elevated, suggesting that her hypertension is not just related to anxiety or stress in a clinical setting.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), chronic hypertension is defined as hypertension that is present before pregnancy or that is diagnosed before 20 weeks of gestation. Given the patient's history and laboratory results, essential hypertension is the most likely diagnosis.",Success
Which ONE of the following represents the MOST appropriate next step in management?,E,"The correct answer is C. Angioplasty of the brachiocephalic vein stenosis plus placement of a stent graft.

The patient has a 50% stenosis of the brachiocephalic vein, which is a significant lesion that may compromise the patency of the dialysis access. Given the patient's history of recurrent AKI and ESRD, it is essential to optimize the dialysis access to ensure adequate blood flow and prevent further complications.

The American Society of Diagnostic and Interventional Nephrology (ASDIN) guidelines recommend that stenoses greater than 50% in the central veins should be treated with angioplasty and stenting. In this case, placing a stent graft is the most appropriate option, as it provides additional support to the vein and reduces the risk of restenosis.

Option A is not recommended, as angioplasty alone may not be sufficient to maintain patency, especially in a central vein. Option B is also not the best choice, as bare metal stents may not provide the same level of support as stent grafts. Option D is not indicated, as hybrid graft catheter devices are typically used for central vein stenosis in patients with a history of multiple failed accesses or complex anatomy, which is not the case here. Option E is not appropriate, as the 50% stenosis requires intervention to prevent further complications.",Success
Which ONE of the following anticoagulation strategies is MOST likely to yield the longest ﬁlter life and the lowest risk of bleeding complications for this patient?,D,"The correct answer is A. Regional citrate anticoagulation.

In this scenario, the patient is at high risk of bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia (platelet count 102,000/µl) and is already receiving vasopressin and norepinephrine infusions, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Regional citrate anticoagulation is a preferred anticoagulation strategy for continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) in patients at high risk of bleeding.

Citrate anticoagulation works by chelating calcium, which is necessary for clotting, and has been shown to reduce the risk of bleeding complications compared to heparin-based anticoagulation strategies. Additionally, citrate anticoagulation has been associated with longer filter life and reduced clotting events compared to heparin-based strategies.

Unfractionated heparin-infused pre-filter (Option B) is not the best choice due to the patient's thrombocytopenia and high risk of bleeding. No anticoagulation (Option C) may lead to filter clotting and reduced filter life. Regional unfractionated heparin-protamine (Option D) is not a recommended anticoagulation strategy for CRRT.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines, citrate anticoagulation is recommended as the first choice for anticoagulation in CRRT, especially in patients at high risk of bleeding.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell him regarding kidney transplantation with HCV1 donor kidneys?,D,"The correct answer is D. Transplantation of HCV Ab + /NAT + kidneys followed by direct-acting antiviral therapy is cost effective compared with continued waiting during dialysis and subsequent receipt of an HCV2 deceased-donor kidney.

Here's why:

The patient is considering receiving a kidney from an HCV-infected donor (HCV+/NAT+). This option can reduce the waiting time for transplantation, which is estimated to be around 5 years for a deceased donor kidney.

Studies have shown that using HCV-infected kidneys followed by direct-acting antiviral therapy (DAAs) is a cost-effective strategy compared to continued waiting on dialysis and subsequent receipt of an HCV-negative deceased-donor kidney (1, 2). This approach can reduce the waiting time, improve patient outcomes, and decrease healthcare costs.

The other options are not accurate:

A. The risk of viral transmission from HCV Ab+/NAT- donors is low, not > 90% (3).

B. Direct-acting antiviral therapy is highly effective in clearing HCV in kidney transplant recipients, with cure rates similar to those in the general population (4).

C. While consenting to receive a kidney from an HCV Ab+ donor may reduce the waiting time, the median waiting time reduction is not similar to that of receiving a high KDPI kidney (5).

Which ONE of the following is the MOST important step in mitigating this patient’s morbidity and mortality in the setting of impending septic shock?,D,"The correct answer is D. Early administration of appropriate antibiotics.

In this scenario, the patient is presenting with signs of sepsis, including hypotension, fever, and confusion, which are indicative of a life-threatening condition. The laboratory results show evidence of kidney dysfunction, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, which further support the diagnosis of sepsis.

Early administration of appropriate antibiotics is the most important step in mitigating this patient's morbidity and mortality. Sepsis is a medical emergency that requires prompt recognition and treatment. Delaying antibiotic administration can lead to increased mortality, organ dysfunction, and prolonged hospital stays.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend that antibiotics should be administered within 1 hour of recognition of sepsis. In this case, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of urosepsis, and early administration of appropriate antibiotics targeting the suspected pathogens (e.g., Gram-negative bacteria) is crucial.

While fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support are also important in managing sepsis, they should not delay the administration of antibiotics. Options A, B, and C are important components of sepsis management, but they are secondary to the early administration of appropriate antibiotics.

It is essential to note that the patient's immunocompromised status as a kidney transplant recipient increases their risk of developing severe sepsis and septic shock, making timely antibiotic administration even more critical.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements is CORRECT?,C,"The correct answer is C. Both cinacalcet and parathyroidectomy decrease levels of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23).

Explanation:
Cinacalcet, a calcimimetic agent, and parathyroidectomy are both effective in controlling secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). While they have different mechanisms of action, both have been shown to decrease levels of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23), a protein involved in phosphate and vitamin D metabolism.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Cinacalcet and parathyroidectomy have different effects on serum calcium. Cinacalcet can decrease serum calcium by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor, whereas parathyroidectomy can lead to hypocalcemia due to the removal of parathyroid glands.

B. The effects of calcimimetic therapy and parathyroidectomy on bone mineral density are not directly comparable. Cinacalcet has been shown to improve bone density in some studies, while parathyroidectomy can lead to a rapid increase in bone density due to the removal of excess parathyroid hormone.

D. Etelcalcetide, another calcimimetic agent, does reduce serum PTH levels, but it has been shown to also decrease FGF23 levels in patients with ESRD.",Success
"Which ONE of the following is the most appropriate treatment for a patient with crystalline nephropathy due to 2,8-dihydroxyadeninuria?",D,"The correct answer is E. Oral pyridoxine supplementation.

The presence of reddish-brown crystals on hematoxylin and eosin staining that are birefringent under polarized light is consistent with 2,8-dihydroxyadenine crystals, which are characteristic of 2,8-dihydroxyadeninuria. This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme adenine phosphoribosyltransferase.

The most effective treatment for 2,8-dihydroxyadeninuria is oral pyridoxine supplementation, which helps to increase the activity of the enzyme adenine phosphoribosyltransferase. This can reduce the formation of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine stones and slow the progression of kidney disease.

The other options are not directly related to the treatment of 2,8-dihydroxyadeninuria:

A. Intravenous fluids and loop diuretic may be used to manage acute kidney stone episodes, but they are not specific to 2,8-dihydroxyadeninuria.

B. Infusion of sodium bicarbonate to alkalinize the urine may be used to treat uric acid stones, but it is not effective for 2,8-dihydroxyadenine stones.

C. Oral potassium citrate may be used to treat calcium oxalate stones, but it is not specific to 2,8-dihydroxyadeninuria.

D. Low-purine diet and allopurinol may be used to treat gout and hyperuricemia, but they are not directly related to 2,8-dihydroxyadeninuria.",Success
Which of the following statements is MOST CORRECT with regard to how you should counsel the patient?,B,"The correct answer is B. It would be helpful to first look at the matching at the DQ locus; if he is not matched at DQ, eplet matching may be of benefit.

Here's why:

* The patient is matched at the DR locus, which is a good start, but it's not the only important consideration in kidney transplantation.
* DQ mismatching is a significant risk factor for antibody-mediated rejection, and eplet matching can provide more detailed information about the compatibility between the donor and recipient at the DQ locus.
* If the patient is not matched at the DQ locus, eplet matching can help identify specific epitopes (regions on the HLA molecule) that may be responsible for potential immune responses.
* By assessing the eplet mismatch, the healthcare team can better predict the risk of rejection and consider strategies to mitigate it, such as desensitization protocols or post-transplant immunosuppression.

Option A is incorrect because being matched at the DR locus does not necessarily mean that eplet matching is not useful. Option C is incorrect because the mismatch at the A locus is not the primary consideration in this scenario. Option D is incorrect because the availability of a living kidney donor does not preclude the potential benefits of eplet matching in assessing compatibility and predicting rejection risk.",Success
"He reads the radiology report online, which notes “extensive calciﬁcation observed in the tunica media of the aorta.” He asks you, “What caused this problem?”
Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the development of vascular calciﬁcation?",A,"The correct answer is A. Secondary calciprotein particles (CPP-II) form as kidney function declines and as a result of decreases in expression of fetuin-A and ƴ-linolenic acid—rich protein, and induce osteoblast differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells.

Vascular calcification is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), including those receiving hemodialysis. The development of vascular calcification is a complex process involving multiple factors.

Fetuin-A, a protein produced by the liver, plays a key role in inhibiting vascular calcification by binding to calcium and phosphate ions, preventing their deposition in vascular tissues. In patients with ESRD, fetuin-A levels are often decreased, leading to an increase in secondary calciprotein particles (CPP-II), which can induce osteoblast differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells, ultimately resulting in vascular calcification.

Option B is incorrect because while extracellular vesicles may play a role in vascular calcification, their removal from serum does not directly increase calcification.

Option C is incorrect because while increased phosphate concentration can contribute to vascular calcification, it is not the sole necessary and sufficient factor.

Option D is incorrect because while patients receiving hemodialysis are at increased risk for vascular calcification, it is not an inevitable consequence of hemodialysis. Other factors, such as duration of dialysis, mineral metabolism, and underlying comorbidities, also play a role.

It's essential to address the patient's concerns and provide education on the underlying causes of vascular calcification, as well as strategies to mitigate its progression, such as phosphate binders, vitamin D therapy, and optimal dialysis management.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you advise her about the risks of steroid elimination after transplantation?,E,"The correct answer is E. It is associated with an increased risk of acute rejection.

Steroid elimination or tapering after kidney transplantation can increase the risk of acute rejection. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are immunosuppressive agents that help prevent rejection by suppressing the immune system's response to the transplanted organ. Rapid tapering or complete elimination of steroids can lead to an increased risk of acute rejection, which can compromise graft function and survival.

While it is true that steroids can contribute to weight gain and glucose intolerance, as the patient is experiencing, completely eliminating steroids may not be the best approach. A more gradual tapering of steroids, as originally planned, may be a better option to balance the risks and benefits.

The other options are not accurate:

A. Steroid elimination is not directly associated with an increased risk of mortality.

B. Steroids do not directly lower the risk of infection. In fact, they can increase the risk of infections by suppressing the immune system.

C. While steroids can contribute to glucose intolerance, eliminating them may not necessarily lower the risk of developing diabetes mellitus, as other factors such as the patient's underlying health and medication regimen also play a role.

D. There is no clear evidence that steroid elimination lowers the risk of malignancy.",Success
Which ONE of the following is correct with regard to predicting outcome of deceased donor kidneys?,D,"The correct answer is A. The presence of macroscopic arteriosclerosis on pre-transplantation biopsy predicts poorer allograft outcomes.

According to the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, the presence of macroscopic arteriosclerosis on pre-transplantation biopsy is a predictor of poorer allograft outcomes, including graft loss and decreased graft survival (1). This is because arteriosclerosis can lead to chronic allograft nephropathy and decreased kidney function over time.

Option B is incorrect because while histological features on pre-transplantation biopsy can provide valuable information about the kidney's condition, they are not more strongly predictive of graft loss than the presence of donor-specific antibodies. Donor-specific antibodies can lead to acute rejection and graft loss, making them a critical consideration in transplant outcomes (2).

Option C is incorrect because while donor HCV antibody positive status may raise concerns about transmission of HCV, the presence of anti-HCV antibody without detectable HCV RNA (as in this case) does not necessarily lead to higher rates of kidney discard. In fact, many transplant centers consider HCV-positive donors as an acceptable option for HCV-positive recipients or recipients who are willing to accept the risk of HCV transmission (3).

Option D is incorrect because while it is true that some studies have shown that kidneys discarded in the US due to histological features may still have acceptable outcomes when transplanted, the specific statistic mentioned (80% allograft survival rate at 5 years) is not directly relevant to this scenario and does not provide conclusive evidence to support this option.

Which ONE of the following factors is associated with an INCREASED risk of hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge?,D,"The correct answer is A. His age.

According to various studies and evidence-based guidelines, advanced age is a significant predictor of hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge. Elderly patients, especially those above 65 years old, are at higher risk of readmission due to various factors such as:

1. Decreased physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to complications
2. Polypharmacy and medication non-adherence
3. Cognitive impairment and decreased ability to manage chronic conditions
4. Social isolation and lack of support systems
5. Increased risk of falls and other safety concerns

The other options are not directly associated with an increased risk of hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge:

B. Sex is not a significant predictor of readmission in this scenario.

C. Decreasing the number of prescribed medications may actually reduce the risk of readmission by minimizing polypharmacy and potential medication-related complications.

D. The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction itself is not a primary predictor of readmission, although it may be related to other factors that increase the risk of readmission, such as age and comorbidities.

E. Obesity is a comorbidity that may increase the risk of readmission indirectly, but it is not a primary predictor of readmission in this scenario.

Which ONE of the following would you do NEXT?,D,"The correct answer is E. Stain prior kidney biopsy for phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antigen.

The patient has steroid-resistant minimal-change disease and persisting nephrotic syndrome. Given the lack of response to corticosteroids, it is essential to consider alternative diagnoses or underlying causes. The kidney biopsy showed minimal changes by light microscopy, and immunofluorescence microscopy was negative for IgG and C3.

Phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) is a well-established antigen associated with membranous nephropathy, which can present with nephrotic syndrome. Staining the prior kidney biopsy for PLA2R antigen can help identify or rule out membranous nephropathy, which may be contributing to the patient's steroid resistance.

The other options are not the next best step in this scenario:

A. Repeating the kidney biopsy with electron microscopy may provide additional information, but it is not the most critical step at this point.

B. Laser dissection/mass spectrometry on the prior kidney biopsy may be useful in identifying specific proteins or biomarkers, but it is not a standard diagnostic test for this scenario.

C. Staining for B7.1 deposits is not a relevant test in this context, as B7.1 is a T-cell costimulatory molecule not typically associated with nephrotic syndrome or glomerular diseases.

D. Congo Red staining is used to diagnose amyloidosis, which is not a likely diagnosis based on the patient's presentation and biopsy results.

By staining the prior kidney biopsy for PLA2R antigen, you can gather more information to guide further management and treatment decisions for this patient.",Success
"In considering her clinical risk factors, which ONE of the following clinical features is MOST highly associated with graft loss after transplant?",A,"The correct answer is A. Midodrine use.

The patient's requirement for midodrine to maintain systolic BP ≥90 mmHg during dialysis indicates that she has severe hypotension, which is a significant risk factor for graft loss after kidney transplantation. Hypotension can lead to decreased perfusion of the transplanted kidney, increasing the risk of graft failure.

While hypomagnesemia (option B) can contribute to cardiovascular disease and potentially affect graft outcomes, it is not as strongly associated with graft loss as hypotension.

Proton pump inhibitor use (option C) and aspirin use (option D) are not directly related to graft loss after transplantation.

It's essential to consider the patient's overall cardiovascular risk profile, including her history of transient ischemic attack and severe left ventricular hypertrophy, when evaluating her suitability for kidney transplantation. However, among the options provided, midodrine use is the most highly associated with graft loss after transplant.",Success
Which ONE of the following would you advise regarding the effect of vesicoureteric reflux on her pregnancy?,B,"The correct answer is B. She is at increased risk of urinary tract infection.

Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a condition where urine flows backward from the bladder into the kidneys, increasing the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs). Although the patient's last UTI was at age 6, her history of VUR puts her at increased risk for UTIs during pregnancy. Pregnant women with a history of VUR are more likely to develop asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can lead to pyelonephritis if left untreated.

There is no conclusive evidence to support an increased risk of preeclampsia (A), gestational hypertension (C), or low birth weight (D) specifically due to VUR. However, it's essential to monitor her closely for any signs of UTIs and to provide guidance on preventive measures, such as frequent voiding, adequate hydration, and good hygiene practices.

It's also important to note that the patient's normal physical examination, serum creatinine level, and urinalysis results suggest that her kidneys are currently functioning well. The normal kidney ultrasound result is also reassuring.",Success
Which ONE of following is the next BEST step in this patient’s management?,C,"The correct answer is C. Conduct further hematologic investigation to search for a B cell clone.

Here's why:

The patient's kidney biopsy results show membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) with monotypic IgA deposits, which suggests a monoclonal gammopathy, likely related to a B cell clone. The presence of kappa-light chains and the absence of lambda-light chains further support this diagnosis.

The next best step would be to conduct further hematologic investigations, such as serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), serum immunofixation, and bone marrow biopsy, to search for a B cell clone and potentially diagnose a plasma cell disorder, such as multiple myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).

Option A, prednisone, may be used to treat some forms of glomerulonephritis, but it is not the next best step in this case, given the suspicion of a B cell clone.

Option B, rituximab, is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that may be used to treat certain B cell disorders, but it is not indicated in this scenario without further evaluation and diagnosis.

Option D, checking the antitissue transglutaminase antibody level, is not relevant to this patient's presentation and diagnosis.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements is TRUE regarding his need for isolation and hepatitis B status?,D,"The correct answer is D. The patient does not need to be isolated because he has developed immunity as the result of a prior hepatitis B infection.

Here's the explanation:

The laboratory results indicate that the patient has a positive hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) and a positive hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), but a negative hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and a negative IgM hepatitis B core antibody. This serological profile suggests that the patient has had a previous hepatitis B infection, but is no longer infectious.

The presence of HBsAb indicates immunity to hepatitis B, which can be acquired through vaccination or natural infection. In this case, the patient's positive HBcAb suggests that the immunity is likely due to a prior infection rather than vaccination.

Since the patient is not currently infectious and has developed immunity, he does not require isolation in the dialysis unit. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines recommend that patients with a similar serological profile do not require isolation or special precautions.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?,D,"Based on the patient's history and laboratory results, the most appropriate management is:

D. Add cinacalcet

Here's why:

* The patient has a history of severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, renal artery stenosis, and chronic atrial fibrillation, which suggests a high risk of cardiovascular events.
* Her PTH values are elevated, ranging from 312 to 479 pg/ml, indicating secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is a common complication of chronic kidney disease.
* The serum calcium and phosphorus values are within the normal range, but the alkaline phosphatase values are elevated, suggesting bone turnover.
* The DEXA scan shows a T score of -2.9 at the hip and -2.5 at the lumbar spine, indicating osteoporosis.
* Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent that can help reduce PTH levels and alleviate symptoms of secondary hyperparathyroidism. It has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and fractures in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Increasing paricalcitol (Option A) may not be effective in reducing PTH levels, and high doses of vitamin D can increase calcium levels and exacerbate cardiovascular risk. Increasing calcium acetate (Option B) may also increase calcium levels and worsen cardiovascular risk. Calcifediol (Option C) is a vitamin D analog that may help improve vitamin D levels, but it is not specifically indicated for secondary hyperparathyroidism.

It's essential to note that cinacalcet should be used under the guidance of a nephrologist, and the patient's calcium and phosphorus levels should be closely monitored to avoid hypocalcemia.",Success
"Question 2536:
Which ONE of the following is preferred initial therapy for a 30-year-old man with IgA nephropathy, 1.2 g proteinuria per day, eGFR 80 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and BPof 128/75 mmHg?",B,"The correct answer is B. Oral ACEIs or ARBs.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for Glomerulonephritis, for patients with IgA nephropathy and proteinuria ≥1 g/day, the initial therapy of choice is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). This is because ACEIs and ARBs have been shown to reduce proteinuria and slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with IgA nephropathy.

In this scenario, the patient has 1.2 g proteinuria per day, which meets the criteria for initiating ACEI or ARB therapy. The patient's eGFR of 80 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and BP of 128/75 mmHg also support the use of ACEI or ARB as initial therapy.

While dietary salt and protein restriction (option A) may be beneficial in reducing proteinuria, it is not the preferred initial therapy in this scenario. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (option C) are not recommended as first-line therapy for IgA nephropathy. Oral steroids plus ACEI or ARB (option D) may be considered in patients with more severe disease or those who do not respond to ACEI or ARB therapy alone. Oral calcitriol (option E) is not a recommended therapy for IgA nephropathy.",Success
"Since implementation of the new Kidney Allocation System (KAS) by the United Network for Organ Sharing on December 4, 2014, which ONE of the following factors now associates with him having an INCREASED likelihood of receiving a deceased donor kidney compared with the prior allocation system?",A,"The correct answer is B. His cPRA.

The Kidney Allocation System (KAS) implemented by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) in 2014 prioritizes candidates with higher sensitization levels, such as those with a high cPRA (calculated panel reactive antibody) level. This is because highly sensitized patients have a lower likelihood of finding a compatible donor kidney.

In the new KAS, patients with a high cPRA (≥80%) are given additional priority points, increasing their chances of receiving a deceased donor kidney. This change aims to improve access to transplantation for highly sensitized patients who would otherwise have a longer waiting time or limited access to compatible organs.

In contrast, the other options do not associate with an increased likelihood of receiving a deceased donor kidney:

A. His race: While racial disparities exist in kidney transplantation, the KAS does not prioritize candidates based on race.

C. His age: Older age may actually decrease the likelihood of receiving a deceased donor kidney, as younger patients are often prioritized.

D. His blood type: Blood type A is a common blood type, and the KAS does not prioritize candidates based on blood type alone.

What is the best initial imaging test?,D,"The correct answer is D. Renal ultrasonography.

According to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria, in patients with suspected nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), ultrasound is the recommended initial imaging test. This is because ultrasound is non-invasive, does not require radiation exposure, and can help identify hydronephrosis (kidney swelling) or stones in the kidneys.

In this case, the patient has a history of kidney stones and is presenting with flank pain, nausea, and vomiting, which suggests a high likelihood of nephrolithiasis. Given the patient's history and symptoms, renal ultrasonography is a reasonable initial imaging test to evaluate for kidney stones or obstruction.

While CT scans (options A and C) are highly sensitive for detecting kidney stones, they involve radiation exposure and are not necessary as an initial test. A radiograph of the abdomen (option B) is not as sensitive as ultrasound or CT for detecting kidney stones and is not the best initial test.

It's worth noting that the patient's recent history of rafting on the Colorado River may suggest dehydration, which could contribute to the development of kidney stones. However, this does not change the initial imaging test of choice, which remains renal ultrasonography.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST accurate regarding use of telemedicine (TM) visits for care of patients with hypertension?,A,"The correct answer is A. The most effective approach is to use TM based on telemonitoring of BP and tracking of additional vital and nonvital signs with data exchange between patients and a case manager through the web, emails, text messaging, or video consultation, integrated with education on lifestyle, risk factors, and proper use of antihypertensive medications.

According to current medical guidelines, telemedicine (TM) can be an effective approach for managing hypertension, especially for patients with poorly controlled hypertension. The American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Society of Hypertension (ASH) recommend the use of telemonitoring and telemedicine for hypertension management, particularly for patients with uncontrolled hypertension.

The AHA/ASH guidelines suggest that telemedicine can improve blood pressure control by:

1. Enhancing patient engagement and empowerment
2. Improving medication adherence
3. Providing timely and frequent monitoring of blood pressure
4. Facilitating lifestyle modifications and education
5. Enhancing communication between patients and healthcare providers

Option A accurately describes the most effective approach to using telemedicine for hypertension management, which involves telemonitoring of blood pressure, tracking of vital signs, and data exchange between patients and healthcare providers, integrated with education on lifestyle modifications and proper use of antihypertensive medications.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect. TM is accredited for the treatment of patients with hypertension, and its use should not be limited to those with well-controlled hypertension or those on less than 3 medications. In fact, TM can be particularly beneficial for patients with poorly controlled hypertension, like the patient in this scenario, who may require more frequent monitoring and adjustments to their treatment plan.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?,D,"The correct answer is D. Cyclophosphamide plus corticosteroids.

The patient's kidney biopsy results are consistent with post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN), which is a complication of her underlying mitral valve endocarditis. The biopsy findings, including the presence of cellular crescents, granular immune deposits, and scattered subepithelial and mesangial deposits, are characteristic of PIGN.

Given the patient's AKI and biopsy findings, the most appropriate management is to treat her with immunosuppressive therapy, specifically cyclophosphamide plus corticosteroids. This is based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, which recommend immunosuppressive therapy for patients with PIGN and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.

Option A, supportive care without further antibiotics or immunosuppression, is not sufficient, as the patient's AKI is likely to progress without treatment.

Option B, referring for mitral valve replacement, may be necessary in the future, but it is not the most urgent priority at this time. The patient's mitral valve endocarditis appears to be under control, and her current focus should be on treating her AKI.

Option C, eculizumab, is not indicated for PIGN. Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is a different condition.

Therefore, the most appropriate management for this patient is cyclophosphamide plus corticosteroids to treat her PIGN and AKI.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell him about the effect of his physical function on his transplantation outcomes?,B,"The correct answer is B. It is associated with increased waitlist mortality.

Research has shown that frailty, as measured by physical function, is a strong predictor of waitlist mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) awaiting kidney transplantation. Frail patients, like the one described, who have difficulty with mobility and activities of daily living, are at higher risk of death while waiting for a transplant. This is likely due to their increased susceptibility to complications, infections, and cardiovascular events.

While graft survival (option A) may be affected by various factors, including immunosuppressive regimens and recipient-donor matching, physical function is not a direct predictor of graft survival. Option C is incorrect, as frailty is actually associated with an increased risk of readmissions after transplantation, not a decreased risk. Finally, while physical therapy (option D) may be beneficial in improving physical function, it is not a guarantee that it can mitigate the effects of frailty on transplant outcomes.

It's essential to have an open and honest conversation with the patient about his prognosis, highlighting the importance of addressing his physical function and frailty to improve his overall health and chances of a successful transplant outcome.",Success
Which ONE of the following is true?,B,"The correct answer is C. A very large patient population (> 10,000 participants) would be required to demonstrate beneﬁt of an intervention for a study with a 0.75 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year lower GFR decline over 2 years caused by the intervention.

Here's why:

The meta-analysis found that a 0.75 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year lower rate of GFR decline was associated with a 29-30% lower risk of ESKD. To demonstrate the benefit of an intervention that causes this magnitude of GFR decline, a large sample size would be required to detect a statistically significant difference in ESKD incidence.

A rough estimate of the required sample size can be made using the hazard ratio (HR) and the confidence interval (CI) provided. Based on the HR and CI, a sample size calculation would suggest that a large patient population (> 10,000 participants) would be needed to demonstrate the benefit of the intervention.

The other options are not supported by the provided information:

A. The absolute difference in ESKD incidence would likely be larger in high-risk patients, as they have a higher baseline risk of ESKD.

B. The meta-analysis was based on observational studies, not randomized trials, and did not confirm the utility of a decrease in eGFR slope as a surrogate endpoint.

D. The provided information does not suggest that using a shorter baseline period to calculate GFR slope would not affect the ability to predict ESKD. In fact, a shorter baseline period may lead to less accurate estimates of GFR slope and potentially affect the predictive ability.",Success
What is the best next action to adjust his regimen to control his BP?,D,"The correct answer is D. Spironolactone is the most appropriate next agent.

Here's why:

* The patient has uncontrolled hypertension, CKD stage 3, and proteinuria, which increases his risk of progressing to ESRD. The current regimen includes a diuretic (chlorthalidone), an ARB (losartan), and a CCB (amlodipine), but his BP remains uncontrolled.
* Option A is incorrect because chlorthalidone can still be effective in patients with CKD stage 3, and discontinuing it may not be necessary at this point.
* Option B is incorrect because the patient is already taking an ARB (losartan), which has anti-proteinuric effects. Adding an ACE inhibitor may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury.
* Option C is incorrect because a β-blocker may not be the most effective agent for this patient, especially since he has a low heart rate (55 beats/min).
* Option D is correct because spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, can be an effective add-on therapy for resistant hypertension, especially in patients with CKD and proteinuria. It can help reduce BP, proteinuria, and the risk of progression to ESRD. The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend considering spironolactone as an add-on therapy for patients with resistant hypertension and CKD.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell his surgeon with regard to on-pump versus off-pump cardiopulmonary bypass and his risk of AKI?,A,"The correct answer is A. Off-pump surgery in eligible patients is associated with a reduced risk of AKI during the ﬁrst postoperative month.

According to the American Heart Association (AHA) and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS), off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may be associated with a lower risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) compared to on-pump CABG, especially in high-risk patients such as those with pre-existing kidney disease (CKD). This is because on-pump CABG can cause hemodynamic instability, inflammation, and oxidative stress, which can exacerbate kidney injury.

A 2019 meta-analysis published in the Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia found that off-pump CABG was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of AKI compared to on-pump CABG, particularly in the early postoperative period.

Therefore, it is reasonable to inform the surgeon that off-pump surgery may be associated with a reduced risk of AKI during the first postoperative month in eligible patients, including this 65-year-old man with stage G3a CKD.",Success
Which ONE of the following is currently the BEST option for anticoagulation strategy in this patient during KRT?,A,"The correct answer is A. Regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA).

In this scenario, the patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) and requires kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Anticoagulation is necessary to prevent clotting in the extracorporeal circuit. Considering the patient's medical history, particularly the parathyroidectomy, and the laboratory results, regional citrate anticoagulation (RCA) is the best option.

RCA is a preferred anticoagulation strategy in critically ill patients, especially those with AKI, as it reduces the risk of bleeding complications compared to systemic anticoagulation with heparin. Citrate also has a calcium-lowering effect, which may be beneficial in this patient with a history of primary hyperparathyroidism.

Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin are not ideal choices in this scenario, as they can increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in patients with AKI. Additionally, the patient's potassium level is already elevated, and heparin can further increase potassium levels.

No anticoagulation is not a suitable option, as it would increase the risk of clotting in the extracorporeal circuit, leading to KRT complications.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury, RCA is recommended as the primary anticoagulation strategy for KRT in critically ill patients.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the BEST available treatment option to reduce her waiting time?,B,"The correct answer is B. Testing for anti-A antibody titers to assess suitability for non-A1 donor kidneys.

The patient has a blood type B and a high cPRA of 80%, which indicates a high likelihood of rejecting a kidney from a donor with a different blood type. However, some individuals with blood type B may have low titers of anti-A antibodies, making them eligible to receive a kidney from a non-A1 donor (a subtype of blood type A). Non-A1 donors have a lower expression of A antigen, which may reduce the risk of rejection.

Testing for anti-A antibody titers can help determine the patient's suitability for a non-A1 donor kidney, potentially increasing the pool of available donors and reducing her waiting time. This option is particularly relevant given the patient's high cPRA and the expected waiting times for different blood types in her region.

Consenting for high KDPI kidney offers (Option A) may reduce the waiting time, but it's not the best option in this case, as the patient would still face a significant waiting time. Desensitization with rituximab and IVIG (Option C) or immunoadsorption therapy (Option D) are not the best options, as they are typically reserved for highly sensitized patients who are not candidates for other options, and their effectiveness in reducing waiting time is uncertain.",Success
"Question 2625:
Compared with furosemide, which ONE of the following statements is CORRECT regarding torsemide?",A,"The correct answer is A. Torsemide has increased bioavailability and a longer half-life.

Explanation: Torsemide is a loop diuretic, similar to furosemide, but with some distinct differences. Compared to furosemide, torsemide has a higher bioavailability (80-90% vs 40-60%) and a longer half-life (3-4 hours vs 1-2 hours). This means that torsemide is more consistently absorbed and stays in the body longer, leading to a more sustained diuretic effect.

Option B is incorrect because both furosemide and torsemide inhibit sodium reabsorption in the loop of Henle, not the proximal tubule.

Option C is incorrect because torsemide is not more kaliuretic (increasing potassium excretion) than furosemide. Both loop diuretics can cause potassium loss, but torsemide may have a slightly more favorable potassium-sparing effect due to its longer half-life.

Option D is incorrect because neither torsemide nor furosemide directly inhibits the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the collecting duct. ENaC inhibition is a mechanism of action for a different class of diuretics, such as amiloride and triamterene.

Which ONE of the following ﬁndings should you tell them is associated with inﬂow stenosis?,D,"The correct answer is D. A discontinuous thrill with only a systolic component at the juxta-anastomotic site.

Inflow stenosis in an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) access is typically associated with a discontinuous thrill, which is a palpable vibration felt over the access. The thrill is usually continuous, but in the presence of inflow stenosis, it becomes discontinuous and may only be felt during systole. This finding is often accompanied by a decreased or absent pulse in the access arm.

The other options are not directly associated with inflow stenosis:

A. Edema in the access arm is more commonly associated with outflow stenosis or central venous stenosis.

B. A high-pitched systolic bruit in the proximal venous segment of the access is more indicative of outflow stenosis.

C. Absence of venous collapse upon arm elevation is a sign of outflow stenosis or central venous stenosis.

E. Augmentation of the pulse on fistula occlusion is a sign of outflow stenosis, not inflow stenosis.

It's essential for the advanced practice providers to recognize these physical examination findings to identify potential issues with the AVF access and initiate timely interventions to maintain access patency and prevent complications.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in management?,D,"The correct answer is D. Decrease dietary sodium intake to 2–3 g/d.

The patient has nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) due to lithium-induced nephrotoxicity. The laboratory results and urinalysis confirm this diagnosis. The patient is currently taking hydrochlorothiazide, which is a diuretic that can help reduce polyuria in nephrogenic DI by increasing sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule and reducing sodium delivery to the distal tubule.

However, the patient's urine sodium level is 70 mEq/L, indicating that the current dose of hydrochlorothiazide may not be sufficient to reduce sodium delivery to the distal tubule. Increasing the dose of hydrochlorothiazide (Option A) may not be effective and may even worsen the patient's polyuria.

Adding amiloride (Option B) may help reduce potassium excretion, but it is not the most appropriate next step in managing the patient's polyuria.

Desmopressin (Option C) is a vasopressin analog that can help increase water reabsorption in the collecting duct. However, it is not effective in nephrogenic DI, as the kidneys are resistant to vasopressin.

Decreasing dietary sodium intake (Option D) is the most appropriate next step in management. By reducing sodium intake, the patient's kidneys will have less sodium to excrete, which can help reduce polyuria. This is a key component of managing nephrogenic DI, and it can be done in conjunction with the current hydrochlorothiazide therapy.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the BEST preoperative imaging study to plan this patient’s access surgery?,B,"The correct answer is A. Vascular ultrasonographic mapping of peripheral and central veins.

For a patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a high likelihood of requiring hemodialysis (HD), creating a functional arteriovenous (AV) access is crucial. Given the patient's history of recurrent osteomyelitis and multiple central and peripheral intravenous catheter placements, it's essential to carefully plan and evaluate the access surgery.

Vascular ultrasonographic mapping of peripheral and central veins (Option A) is the best preoperative imaging study for several reasons:

1. Non-invasive: Ultrasonography is a non-invasive, low-risk procedure that can help identify suitable veins for access creation.
2. Comprehensive evaluation: Ultrasonographic mapping can assess both peripheral and central veins, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's venous anatomy.
3. Identification of suitable veins: This study can help identify veins with adequate diameter, flow, and patency, increasing the chances of successful access creation.
4. Reduced complications: By identifying potential issues, such as stenosis or occlusion, preoperatively, the risk of complications during access surgery can be minimized.

While small-dose venography (Option B) can also provide valuable information, it is an invasive procedure that carries a higher risk of complications, such as contrast-induced nephropathy, and is generally reserved for cases where ultrasonography is inconclusive.

Selective vasculature ultrasonographic mapping of peripheral veins only (Option C) may not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's venous anatomy, as it only focuses on peripheral veins and may not assess central veins, which are also critical for access creation.

In accordance with current guidelines, the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) recommends preoperative vascular mapping using ultrasonography to identify suitable veins for AV access creation in patients with ESRD.",Success
Which statement below is incorrect?,C,"The correct answer is C. Factors that increase the fracture risk of ESRD patients include age and CKD with mineral and bone disorder but not osteoporosis.

Osteoporosis is indeed a significant factor that increases the fracture risk in ESRD patients, particularly in older adults. Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a complex condition that affects bone health in ESRD patients, and it is often associated with osteoporosis. The combination of CKD-MBD and osteoporosis can further increase the risk of fractures in this population.

The other options are correct:

A. The risk of fracture is higher in ESRD patients compared to non-ESRD patients, especially in older adults.

B. ESRD patients have a higher mortality risk after a fracture compared to non-ESRD patients, which may be attributed to underlying comorbidities and the complexity of their medical condition.

D. ESRD patients, especially those with multiple comorbidities, are likely to have a prolonged hospitalization after a fracture due to the need for careful management of their underlying conditions, including dialysis, and the potential for complications during the recovery period.",Success
What is the most likely ﬁnding?,B,"Based on the patient's presentation and medical history, the most likely finding on renal biopsy is:

A. Thrombotic microangiopathy

Here's why:

* The patient is taking sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which is known to cause hypertension and proteinuria as adverse effects.
* The development of new-onset hypertension and proteinuria (3+ on urinalysis and 3.7 g on 24-hour urine collection) suggests a possible drug-induced kidney injury.
* The increase in serum creatinine from 0.9 mg/dL to 1.3 mg/dL indicates a decline in renal function.
* Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a known complication of sunitinib therapy, and it can cause hypertension, proteinuria, and acute kidney injury.
* The other options are less likely given the patient's presentation and medical history:
	+ Collapsing FSGS (B) is typically associated with a more rapid decline in renal function and is less commonly associated with sunitinib therapy.
	+ Membranous nephropathy (C) is a type of glomerulonephritis that is not typically associated with sunitinib therapy.
	+ AA amyloidosis (D) is a rare condition that is not typically associated with sunitinib therapy or the patient's presentation.

It's essential to note that a renal biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, and the pathologist's report will provide a definitive diagnosis.",Success
"Question 2700:
Which ONE of the following criteria is MOST consistent with a diagnosis of a stenotic lesion of an arteriovenous ﬁstula by ultrasonography?",C,"The correct answer is C. A twofold increase in peak systolic flow velocity ratio.

According to the Society of Vascular Ultrasound, a twofold increase in peak systolic flow velocity ratio is a criterion for diagnosing a stenotic lesion of an arteriovenous fistula by ultrasonography. This is because stenosis causes a significant increase in blood flow velocity at the site of the lesion, which can be measured using Doppler ultrasonography.

Option A is incorrect because a 25% reduction in luminal diameter may not necessarily indicate a stenotic lesion.

Option B is incorrect because decreased peak systolic flow velocity is not a characteristic of a stenotic lesion.

Option D is incorrect because a low-resistance Doppler waveform is not specific to stenotic lesions and can be seen in other conditions.

Option E is incorrect because an increase in access flow volume is not a direct indicator of a stenotic lesion.

It's essential to accurately diagnose stenotic lesions in arteriovenous fistulas to ensure timely intervention and prevent complications, such as thrombosis and access failure.",Success
"In considering strategies to maintain RRF in PD patients, which of the following is correct?",B,"The correct answer is B. Exposure to PD fluids containing high concentrations of glucose has been associated with faster loss of RRF.

Research has consistently shown that the use of PD fluids with high glucose concentrations can accelerate the decline of residual renal function (RRF) in peritoneal dialysis patients. This is because high glucose concentrations can cause inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis in the kidneys, leading to further deterioration of renal function.

The other options are incorrect:

A. ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to have a neuroprotective effect and slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with chronic kidney disease. They have not been associated with faster loss of RRF.

C. While volume management is important in PD patients, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that maintaining mild volume expansion protects against loss of RRF.

D. Biocompatible PD solutions have been shown to be beneficial in preserving RRF compared to conventional PD solutions. Biocompatible solutions have a lower glucose degradation product content, which can reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in the peritoneum, thereby helping to preserve RRF.

It's essential to educate the patient on the importance of using biocompatible PD solutions and minimizing exposure to high glucose concentrations to help preserve her remaining kidney function while waiting for renal transplantation.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the next BEST step in this patient’s management?,A,"The correct answer is A. Review the patient's baseline vital signs.

Here's why:

The patient presents with a 3-day history of poor appetite, increased confusion, and a complaint of ""feeling hot."" Although her temperature is only 37.3°C, her mild tachypnea and crackles at both lung bases suggest possible underlying respiratory issues. Given her ESRD and mild cognitive impairment, it's essential to assess her baseline vital signs to determine if her current presentation is a deviation from her normal state.

Reviewing her baseline vital signs will help identify any significant changes that may indicate an underlying infection, dehydration, or other complications. This information will guide further management decisions, such as ordering diagnostic tests, administering fluids or antibiotics, or adjusting her dialysis regimen.

The other options are not the next best step:

B. Ordering a 500-ml bolus of intravenous normal saline may be premature without first assessing her baseline vital signs and determining if she is indeed dehydrated.

C. Lowering the patient's target weight by 1 kg may not be relevant to her current presentation and may even exacerbate any potential dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.

D. Ordering empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone is not justified at this point, as there is no clear evidence of sepsis or a specific infection that would require broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.",Success
"When managing BP and volume status in PD patients, which of the following is correct?",B,"The correct answer is D. In patients initiating PD, higher BPs have been associated with increased mortality rates.

This option is supported by evidence-based practices. Hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and poor blood pressure (BP) control is associated with increased mortality rates. Studies have shown that higher BP levels at the initiation of PD are associated with increased mortality rates, emphasizing the importance of optimal BP control in this patient population.

Option A is incorrect because bioimpedance studies suggest that fluid overload is more common in PD patients than HD patients, not the other way around. Fluid overload is a significant concern in PD patients, particularly those with residual renal function (RRF), as it can lead to hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, and cardiovascular morbidity.

Option B is correct, but it's not the best answer. Bioimpedance spectroscopy has identified risk factors for fluid overload in PD patients, including hypoalbuminemia and diabetes. However, this option doesn't directly address the question about managing BP and volume status in PD patients.

Option C is incorrect. While bioimpedance data can be useful in assessing fluid status, there is limited evidence to suggest that managing fluid status using bioimpedance data improves outcomes for patients on PD. Further research is needed to establish the effectiveness of bioimpedance-guided fluid management in PD patients.

In this scenario, it's essential to address the patient's concerns and preferences while emphasizing the importance of optimal BP control. The healthcare team should consider adjusting the PD prescription to increase ultrafiltration (UF) and improve fluid removal, as well as optimizing antihypertensive therapy to achieve better BP control.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely cause of the hyponatremia?,A,"The correct answer is A. Ipilimumab-related hypophysitis with secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as headache, confusion, and lethargy, are consistent with hyponatremia.
* The laboratory results show hyponatremia (serum sodium 116 mEq/L) with a low serum osmolality (242 mOsm/kg) and an inappropriately high urine osmolality (426 mOsm/kg), suggesting syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).
* The MRI findings of diffuse pituitary enlargement without focal mass lesions support the diagnosis of hypophysitis, which is a known side effect of ipilimumab therapy.
* The delayed relaxation phase of the deep tendon reflexes is also consistent with hypopituitarism.
* Secondary adrenal insufficiency due to hypophysitis would lead to a decrease in aldosterone production, causing hyponatremia.
* Option B is unlikely because primary adrenal insufficiency would typically present with hyperpigmentation, which is not mentioned in the patient's physical examination.
* Option C is also unlikely because the MRI did not show any focal mass lesions in the pituitary gland.
* Option D is unlikely because primary polydipsia would typically cause a dilute urine, which is not consistent with the patient's urine osmolality of 426 mOsm/kg.

Ipilimumab, a checkpoint inhibitor, can cause immune-related adverse events, including hypophysitis, which can lead to secondary adrenal insufficiency and hyponatremia.",Success
Which of the following statements is MOST accurate?,D,"The correct answer is C. DXA should be done, but clinical variables should also be assessed using the fracture risk assessment tool to increase the predictive capability of DXA.

Here's why:

* Option A is incorrect because while it's true that DXA may not be as accurate in patients with renal osteodystrophy, it's still a useful screening tool. Additionally, the patient's PTH and phosphorus levels have always been normal, which reduces the likelihood of significant renal osteodystrophy.
* Option B is incorrect because while certain osteoporosis treatments may be contraindicated or require dose adjustments in patients with reduced eGFR, this doesn't mean screening for osteoporosis is unnecessary. In fact, early detection and management of osteoporosis are crucial in patients with CKD, as they are at higher risk of fractures.
* Option D is incorrect because while the patient should be screened for osteoporosis, it's not as simple as following general population screening guidelines. The patient's CKD and history of lupus nephritis may affect the interpretation of DXA results, so additional clinical variables should be assessed to increase the predictive capability of DXA.

The correct approach is to perform DXA screening and combine the results with clinical variables, such as age, sex, weight, height, and other risk factors, using a fracture risk assessment tool like FRAX. This will provide a more accurate estimate of the patient's fracture risk and guide treatment decisions.",Success
"When considering a treatment plan, which of the following is MOST correct?",D,"The correct answer is D. In the MENTOR study, those treated with rituximab had higher rates of remission at 24-month follow-up.

The patient's diagnosis of membranous nephropathy (MN) with positive PLA2R antibody and nephrotic syndrome requires a thoughtful treatment plan. 

Option A is incorrect because while ACE-I can help reduce proteinuria, immunosuppressive therapy is often necessary to induce remission in MN. 

Option B is incorrect because the RI-CYCLO trial actually showed that rituximab was non-inferior to cyclophosphamide in inducing remission in MN.

Option C is incorrect because the MENTOR study found that patients treated with rituximab had higher rates of remission at 24-month follow-up compared to those treated with cyclosporin.

The MENTOR study demonstrated that rituximab is an effective treatment option for MN, and it is often considered a first-line therapy, especially in patients with high levels of PLA2R antibody.",Success
"In addition to potassium supplementation and continuous monitoring of the volume status, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management strategy for this man’s acid-base disorder?",A,"The correct answer is A. Discontinue furosemide and begin intravenous 0.9% saline at 125 ml/h.

The patient's acid-base disorder is a metabolic alkalosis, as evidenced by the elevated pH (7.47) and bicarbonate level (38 mEq/L). The likely cause of this metabolic alkalosis is the use of furosemide, a diuretic that can cause potassium depletion and metabolic alkalosis.

Discontinuing furosemide and replacing it with intravenous 0.9% saline at 125 ml/h is the most appropriate management strategy for several reasons:

1. Furosemide is contributing to the metabolic alkalosis and potassium depletion, so discontinuing it will help correct these abnormalities.
2. The patient is volume-depleted, as evidenced by the low blood pressure (96/60 mmHg) and lack of peripheral edema. Administering intravenous saline will help restore volume and improve perfusion.
3. The patient's kidney function is impaired (stage G3b CKD), and using intravenous saline will help maintain renal perfusion and function.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

B. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that can exacerbate metabolic alkalosis and is not indicated in this scenario.

C. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that may help with potassium depletion, but it will not address the underlying metabolic alkalosis.

D. Ammonium chloride is an acidifying agent that can help correct metabolic alkalosis, but it is not a suitable choice in this scenario due to the patient's kidney impairment and risk of worsening acid-base disturbances.",Success
"Assuming there is a reduced fractional excretion of sodium, which of the following is directly contributing to the sodium retention occurring in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Renal tubular α-adrenergic receptors.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that produces excessive amounts of catecholamines, such as norepinephrine and epinephrine. These hormones can cause anxiety, tachycardia, and hypertension.

In this case, the reduced fractional excretion of sodium is likely due to the stimulation of renal tubular α-adrenergic receptors by the excessive norepinephrine. Activation of these receptors increases sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule, leading to sodium retention and hypertension.

The other options are not directly contributing to sodium retention in this patient:

B. Juxtaglomerular α-adrenergic receptors are involved in the regulation of renin release, which affects blood pressure, but not directly related to sodium retention.

C. Preganglionic β-adrenergic receptors are involved in the regulation of sympathetic nervous system activity, but not directly related to sodium retention.

D. Vascular α-adrenergic receptors are involved in vasoconstriction, which can contribute to hypertension, but not directly related to sodium retention.

E. Cardiac β-adrenergic receptors are involved in the regulation of heart rate and contractility, but not directly related to sodium retention.

It's essential to note that pheochromocytoma is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent complications.",Success
What is the next best step?,D,"The correct answer is D. Evaluate her for primary aldosteronism.

The patient has a family history of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) on her father's side, which may suggest a genetic component to her hypertension. Additionally, she has experienced severe hypokalemia with chlorthalidone, which is a diuretic that can cause potassium depletion. The combination of these factors raises the suspicion of primary aldosteronism, a condition characterized by excessive aldosterone production, leading to hypertension and hypokalemia.

Before considering other treatment options, it is essential to rule out primary aldosteronism. This can be done through laboratory tests, such as measuring plasma aldosterone and renin levels, and potentially, a confirmatory test like the fludrocortisone suppression test.

Option A is not the best choice because, although spironolactone is a reasonable treatment option for resistant hypertension, it may not be the most appropriate choice given the patient's fear of hyperkalemia and the need to evaluate for primary aldosteronism first.

Option B is not the best choice because, while clonidine or hydralazine may be tolerated better, they may not address the underlying cause of the patient's hypertension.

Option C is not the best choice because retrying chlorthalidone, even at a lower dose, may still cause hypokalemia, and it is essential to evaluate for primary aldosteronism before considering other diuretics.",Success
"In addition to saline infusions, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate treatment of this man's hypercalcemia?",B,"The correct answer is C. Weight-based dose of zoledronic acid.

Here's why:

* The patient has persistent hypercalcemia despite bisphosphonate treatment 2 weeks ago, indicating that a more aggressive approach is needed.
* Denosumab (options A and B) is not typically used for hypercalcemia of malignancy, and its use is generally reserved for osteoporosis or bone metastases.
* Calcitonin (option D) can be used for hypercalcemia, but its effect is often short-lived (hours to days) and may require frequent dosing.
* Zoledronic acid, a bisphosphonate, is a more appropriate choice for hypercalcemia of malignancy, especially in the setting of multiple myeloma. A weight-based dose is recommended to ensure adequate treatment.

According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines, zoledronic acid is a recommended treatment for hypercalcemia of malignancy, and the dose should be adjusted based on the patient's weight and renal function.

It's also important to note that the patient's underlying CKD and anemia should be considered when choosing a treatment, and close monitoring of his electrolytes, renal function, and overall condition is essential.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in management?,B,"The correct answer is B. Reduce the tacrolimus dose.

Rationale:

The patient's asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine, along with an increase in tacrolimus levels, suggests calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) toxicity as the most likely cause of her kidney dysfunction. Tacrolimus is a CNI commonly used in kidney transplant recipients to prevent rejection. The increase in tacrolimus levels from 5 ng/ml to 10 ng/ml over the past 2 months is a significant change, and reducing the dose is the most appropriate next step to mitigate potential CNI toxicity.

The other options are not supported by the patient's presentation and laboratory results:

A. Nephrostomy tube placement is not indicated, as there is no evidence of obstructive uropathy or severe hydronephrosis.

C. Pulse intravenous methylprednisolone is not necessary, as there is no indication of acute rejection.

D. Dexamethasone followed by induction of labor and delivery is not warranted, as the patient's condition is not severe enough to require immediate delivery, and the focus should be on managing her kidney function rather than inducing labor.

It's essential to monitor the patient's kidney function and adjust her medications accordingly to ensure the best possible outcomes for both the mother and the fetus.",Success
Which ONE of the following outcomes can he expect from implementing such an exercise regimen during dialysis?,D,"The correct answer is D. An improvement in peak oxygen consumption.

Studies have shown that intradialytic exercise, including resistance exercises with weights and elastic bands, can improve cardiovascular fitness and peak oxygen consumption in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. This is because exercise during dialysis can help improve cardiovascular function, increase muscle strength, and enhance overall physical function.

The other options are not supported by evidence:

A. There is no evidence to suggest that exercising during dialysis would decline dialysis adequacy. In fact, some studies suggest that exercise during dialysis may even improve solute removal.

B. While there is a risk of musculoskeletal injuries with any exercise program, the risk can be minimized with proper supervision, gradual progression, and adaptation to the individual's fitness level.

C. Exercise during dialysis has been shown to be safe and may even reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with ESRD.

It's essential to note that before starting any exercise program, the patient should consult with their healthcare provider to discuss any potential contraindications or modifications needed to ensure safety.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis?,D,"The correct answer is D. Incomplete distal renal tubular acidosis (type 1).

Here's why:

* The patient's stone composition is calcium phosphate, which is consistent with alkaline urine pH.
* The 24-hour urine collection shows a pH of 6.1, which is slightly acidic, but not as acidic as expected in complete distal RTA.
* The citrate level is low (102 mg, target > 450 mg), which is a characteristic feature of distal RTA.
* The patient's serum chemistry is normal, with no evidence of metabolic acidosis (normal total CO2, chloride, and potassium levels).
* The patient's urine phosphate level is low (358 mg, reference range 600-1200 mg), which is consistent with distal RTA.

Type 4 RTA (A) is characterized by hyperkalemia, which is not present in this patient. Proximal RTA (B) typically presents with a more severe metabolic acidosis and a higher urine pH. Dent disease (C) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis, and progressive kidney disease, but it is not the most likely diagnosis based on the provided laboratory results.

Incomplete distal RTA (D) is a diagnosis of exclusion, and it is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's laboratory results, particularly the low urine citrate level and the slightly acidic urine pH.",Success
Which of the following best predicts her risk of CKD?,D,"The correct answer is D. Creatinine and urine protein 3 months after discharge.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) after an episode of acute kidney injury (AKI) is best predicted by the patient's kidney function and proteinuria at 3 months after the AKI episode.

Option A, having had kidney replacement therapy (KRT) for 2 days, is not a reliable predictor of CKD risk. While KRT is often necessary in severe AKI, its duration does not directly correlate with long-term kidney function.

Option B, oligoanuria on presentation to the hospital, is a symptom of AKI, but it does not provide information about the patient's kidney function after recovery from the acute episode.

Option C, creatinine at the time of discharge, is also not a reliable predictor of CKD risk. Creatinine levels can fluctuate during the recovery phase, and a single measurement at discharge may not reflect the patient's ultimate kidney function.

In contrast, measuring creatinine and urine protein 3 months after discharge provides a more accurate assessment of the patient's kidney function and proteinuria, which are key factors in determining the risk of CKD. This approach is supported by evidence-based guidelines and is widely used in clinical practice.",Success
Which ONE of the following is MOST likely to result from implementation of albumin dialysis compared with standard medical therapy for this patient?,B,"The correct answer is C. Decreased inpatient mortality risk.

Albumin dialysis, also known as molecular adsorbent recirculation system (MARS), has been shown to improve survival in patients with acute liver failure and hepatorenal syndrome. Studies have demonstrated that MARS therapy can reduce mortality rates compared to standard medical therapy in this patient population.

While albumin dialysis may also help to reduce serum ammonia levels (Option A) and improve mental status (Option B), the most significant benefit is the reduction in inpatient mortality risk.

There is no evidence to suggest that albumin dialysis increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (Option D).

It's essential to note that albumin dialysis is a complex and resource-intensive therapy that should only be considered in specialized centers with experience in managing patients with acute liver failure and hepatorenal syndrome.",Success
"In addition to ongoing close follow-up of this woman’s kidney function, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Assess for donor-specific antibodies.

The patient's allograft biopsy shows evidence of glomerulitis and peritubular capillaritis, which are indicative of acute rejection. The absence of C4d staining suggests that the rejection is not antibody-mediated. However, the presence of chronic interstitial fibrosis and vascular injury suggests that there may be ongoing immune-mediated injury.

Given the patient's history of kidney transplantation and the current biopsy findings, assessing for donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) is the most appropriate management step. DSAs are a known risk factor for acute rejection and graft failure, and their presence can guide treatment decisions, such as adjusting immunosuppressive therapy or considering desensitization protocols.

Option A, assessing for donor-derived cell-free DNA, is not directly relevant to the management of this patient's acute rejection episode. While cell-free DNA may be a useful biomarker for graft injury, it is not a specific test for acute rejection.

Option C, introducing an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, may be beneficial for managing hypertension and proteinuria, but it is not specifically targeted to addressing the acute rejection episode.

Option D, assessing for urinary chemokines, is not a standard test for evaluating acute rejection in kidney transplant patients.

It's essential to note that the patient's tacrolimus trough level is elevated, which may contribute to the development of chronic fibrosis and vascular injury. Adjusting the immunosuppressive regimen and monitoring for potential side effects will be crucial in managing this patient's condition.",Success
Which ONE of the following is an essential component of the infection prevention and control program within a dialysis facility?,A,"The correct answer is A. Infection surveillance and use of infection rate data to drive prevention.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), infection surveillance and the use of infection rate data to drive prevention are essential components of an infection prevention and control program in a dialysis facility. This involves actively monitoring and tracking infections, identifying trends and patterns, and using this data to inform prevention strategies and improve patient outcomes.

Option B is not correct because while having a dedicated staff person to oversee the infection control program is important, it is not an essential component of the program itself.

Option C is not correct because while epidemiologists can be useful in investigating outbreaks, hiring one to investigate blood-stream infections specifically is not a required component of an infection prevention and control program.

Option D is not correct because using common medication carts to deliver medications to patients is not a recommended practice in infection prevention and control, as it can increase the risk of cross-contamination and infection transmission.",Success
Which of the following is the patient most likely to experience during his clinical course?,C,"The correct answer is C. He is at increased risk of having technique failure with a home modality, such as PD.

This patient's presentation suggests frailty, which is a common condition in older adults with CKD. Frailty is characterized by decreased physiologic reserve, making individuals more vulnerable to stressors and increasing their risk of adverse outcomes. The patient's unintentional weight loss, poor appetite, exhaustion, slow gait speed, and need for assistance with daily activities are all indicative of frailty.

Frail patients are at higher risk of technique failure with home dialysis modalities, such as peritoneal dialysis (PD), due to their decreased ability to perform the necessary tasks and manage the equipment. This is because PD requires a certain level of physical and cognitive function to perform exchanges, manage fluids, and troubleshoot issues.

Option A is incorrect because frail patients are actually at increased risk of hospitalizations and emergency department visits due to their decreased physiologic reserve and increased susceptibility to complications.

Option B is incorrect because while the patient may be a candidate for renal transplantation, his frailty status increases his risk of post-transplantation complications, such as infections, cardiovascular events, and delayed recovery.

Option D is incorrect because while dialysis may be necessary in the future, the patient's symptoms are not solely due to his CKD, but also related to his frailty. Initiating dialysis earlier may not necessarily improve his symptoms, and it's essential to address his frailty and other comorbidities before making a decision about dialysis initiation.",Success
Which ONE of the following should be done NEXT to identify the cause of the lesion?,B,"The correct answer is C. Staining of the biopsy specimen for C1q and C4d.

Here's why:

The patient's kidney biopsy shows a lesion of mild membranous nephropathy with subepithelial electron-dense deposits, which is consistent with a diagnosis of membranous nephropathy. The strong and intense granular C3 deposits along the capillary walls suggest an immune complex-mediated disease process.

To further identify the cause of the lesion, it is essential to determine whether the deposits are related to a lupus-like disease or a primary membranous nephropathy. Staining for C1q and C4d can help differentiate between these two possibilities.

C1q is a component of the classical complement pathway, and its presence in the deposits suggests a lupus-like disease. C4d, on the other hand, is a component of the lectin pathway, and its presence is more consistent with primary membranous nephropathy.

The other options are not the next best step:

A. Pronase digestion of paraffin-embedded material and stain for PLA2R antigen is not necessary, as the patient's serum anti-PLA2R antibodies are already negative.

B. Pronase digestion of paraffin-embedded material and staining for monoclonal IgG (light and heavy chains) is not relevant to this diagnosis, as there is no suspicion of a monoclonal gammopathy.

D. Staining of the biopsy with Congo Red or thioflavine T is used to diagnose amyloidosis, which is not suspected in this case.

By staining for C1q and C4d, the healthcare provider can gain further insight into the underlying cause of the membranous nephropathy and guide subsequent management and treatment.",Success
"Question 2835:
Which ONE of the following patients has the LOWEST risk of AKI?",B,"The correct answer is B. A 62-year-old man with a stage G3a:A1 CKD (eGFR 46 ml/min per A.73 m2) scheduled for elective coronary artery by-pass surgery with a GFR that increases by 42 ml/min per 1.73 m2 after a protein load of 1.2 g/kg body weight.

This patient has a relatively preserved kidney function (eGFR 46 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and demonstrates a robust response to a protein load, indicating a preserved renal reserve. This suggests that the patient's kidneys are able to adapt to changes in blood flow and pressure, making them less susceptible to acute kidney injury (AKI).

In contrast, the other options all have significant risk factors for AKI:

A. The patient with fulminant hepatic failure is at high risk of AKI due to the underlying liver disease, potential hypotension, and the need for emergent liver transplantation.

C. The patient with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis and baseline kidney dysfunction (serum creatinine 0.3 mg/dl) is at risk of AKI due to the underlying liver disease, potential hypotension, and the use of nephrotoxic antibiotics (gentamicin).

D. The patient with stage G4 CKD, chronic systolic heart failure, and cardiogenic shock is at high risk of AKI due to the underlying kidney disease, cardiac dysfunction, and the need for invasive hemodynamic support (intra-aortic balloon pump) and emergency surgery.

Therefore, option B has the lowest risk of AKI among the four options.",Success
"Based on the existing literature, implementing such electronic medical record support will result in which ONE of the following improvements in care for patients with and at risk for AKI?",B,"Based on the existing literature, the correct answer is A. A reduction in nephrotoxin exposure and events requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT), but no change in hospital mortality.

Studies have consistently shown that implementing electronic medical record-based clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) for acute kidney injury (AKI) can lead to a reduction in nephrotoxin exposure and events requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). This is because CDSSs can alert healthcare providers to potential nephrotoxins, facilitate earlier recognition of AKI, and promote timely interventions to prevent or mitigate AKI.

However, the evidence is less clear on the impact of CDSSs on inpatient mortality. While some studies suggest a potential reduction in mortality, others have found no significant effect. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer based on the current literature.

Which of the following is the next best step in your evaluation of this living donor candidate?,C,"The correct answer is C. Discuss potential risks and benefits of genetic testing with him now, and proceed with genetic testing only if he agrees.

As the living kidney donor candidate's healthcare provider, it is essential to consider the potential risks associated with the genetic variants identified in his mother. The COL4A4 and APOL1 gene renal risk variants may increase the risk of kidney disease in the donor candidate, particularly if he inherits these variants.

Before proceeding with genetic testing, it is crucial to have an informed discussion with the donor candidate about the potential risks and benefits of testing. This includes explaining the possibility of identifying genetic variants that may affect his own kidney health, the potential impact on his decision to donate a kidney, and the importance of genetic counseling.

Option A is incorrect because, despite the donor candidate's normal urinalysis and urine albumin excretion results, the presence of genetic variants in his mother increases his risk of developing kidney disease. Genetic testing is necessary to assess this risk.

Option B is unethical and incorrect because the donor candidate has the right to autonomy and informed decision-making regarding his own health. Genetic testing without his knowledge or consent is not acceptable.

Option D is also incorrect because, although the donor candidate may be at increased risk for kidney disease, it is not yet clear whether he has inherited the genetic variants. Declining him as a candidate without further evaluation is premature.",Success
Which ONE of the following is MOST likely to result in transplantation within the next 6 to 12 months?,B,"The correct answer is A. Desensitization with plasma exchange, IVIG, and rituximab followed by living donor transplantation.

Given the patient's strongly positive crossmatch with her husband, a living donor transplantation would not be possible without desensitization. The combination of plasma exchange, IVIG, and rituximab has been shown to be effective in reducing anti-donor antibodies and allowing for successful transplantation in patients with a positive crossmatch (1, 2). This approach would allow the patient to receive a kidney from her husband, which would likely result in transplantation within the next 6-12 months.

Option B, entrance into a paired exchange program, may take longer to result in transplantation, as it relies on finding a compatible match between the patient and another donor-recipient pair.

Option C, continued waiting for a deceased-donor kidney, is unlikely to result in transplantation within the next 6-12 months, given the mean waiting time in her region is 3 years.

Option D, desensitization with IVIG and rituximab while awaiting deceased-donor transplantation, may not be as effective as the combination therapy with plasma exchange, and the waiting time for a deceased-donor kidney would still be uncertain.

What is the highest priority “next intervention”?,C,"Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results, I would choose option C: Arrange for CT venography to exclude renal vein thrombosis.

Here's my reasoning:

* The patient presents with severe unilateral flank pain, which could be indicative of a vascular issue, such as renal vein thrombosis (RVT).
* The urinalysis shows 2+ hematuria and nondysmorphic RBCs, which could be consistent with RVT.
* The 24-hour urine collection demonstrates 12 grams of protein, which is a significant amount and could be related to RVT.
* The patient's history of IV drug use increases the risk of thrombotic events, including RVT.
* While the patient is hepatitis B virus positive, there is no clear indication that the proteinuria and AKI are directly related to HBV-associated membranous nephropathy (MN) at this point.
* A kidney biopsy (option A) may be premature without further evaluation, and treating for a presumed urinary tract infection (option B) is not supported by the urinalysis results.

CT venography is a non-invasive test that can help diagnose RVT, which is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment. Excluding RVT as a cause of the patient's symptoms and laboratory results is a high priority at this point.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell them regarding the diagnostic accuracy of available surveillance methods?,C,"The correct answer is D. Combining physical examination results with a venous access pressure ratio > 0.5 improves diagnostic performance of the tests in detecting outflow stenosis.

Here's why:

* Option A is incorrect because different surveillance methods have varying sensitivities in identifying inﬂow and outﬂow stenosis in both ﬁstula and graft.
* Option B is incorrect because access flows < 650 ml/min is not the best method to detect outflow stenosis. While low access flow can indicate stenosis, it is not specific to outflow stenosis.
* Option C is incorrect because the optimal test for identifying an inﬂow stenosis is not solely based on access flows < 650 ml/min or the combination of a positive physical examination result plus access flows < 650 ml/min.

According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, combining physical examination results with a venous access pressure ratio > 0.5 improves the diagnostic performance of the tests in detecting outflow stenosis. This is because physical examination can identify signs of stenosis, such as abnormal thrill or bruit, and the venous access pressure ratio can quantify the severity of stenosis. The combination of these two methods increases the sensitivity and specificity of detecting outflow stenosis.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements is correct?,D,"The correct answer is A. Paricalcitol lowers PTH production by enhancing the binding of calcium to the calcium-sensing receptor.

Here's why:

* Paricalcitol is a vitamin D analog that suppresses parathyroid hormone (PTH) production by enhancing the binding of calcium to the calcium-sensing receptor on parathyroid cells. This leads to a decrease in PTH production.
* Cinacalcet, on the other hand, is a calcimimetic that blocks the release of PTH by activating the calcium-sensing receptor, but it does not block the binding of PTH to its receptors in bone (option B is incorrect).
* Cinacalcet does not stimulate the degradation of circulating PTH (option C is incorrect).
* Phosphate has the opposite effect on PTH production. High phosphate levels can increase PTH production by reducing the binding of calcium to the calcium-sensing receptor, leading to secondary hyperparathyroidism (option D is incorrect).

This information is supported by current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices in the management of parathyroid disorders.",Success
Which ONE of the following factors is associated with the greatest risk of thiazide-associated hyponatremia for this patient?,D,"The correct answer is A. Female sex.

Thiazide diuretics can cause hyponatremia, particularly in certain patient populations. According to current evidence, female sex is a significant risk factor for thiazide-associated hyponatremia. Studies have consistently shown that women are more likely to develop hyponatremia than men, especially when taking thiazide diuretics.

The other options are not directly associated with an increased risk of thiazide-associated hyponatremia:

B. eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) is a measure of kidney function, and while it's important to consider kidney function when prescribing diuretics, it's not a specific risk factor for hyponatremia.

C. The type of thiazide diuretic used (chlorthalidone vs. HCTZ) may affect the risk of hyponatremia, but the difference is not significant enough to be a major risk factor.

D. BMI (body mass index) is not a known risk factor for thiazide-associated hyponatremia.

It's essential to discuss the potential risks and benefits of thiazide diuretics with the patient, especially considering her female sex, and to closely monitor her sodium levels during treatment.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements reﬂects the BEST next step?,C,"The correct answer is C. Perform a 24-hour urine stone proﬁle, and if it is normal, accept for right donor nephrectomy.

Explanation:

The presence of a nonobstructing 4-mm stone in the right kidney raises concerns about nephrolithiasis. However, the lack of a personal or family history of kidney stones suggests that this may be an incidental finding. The American Society of Transplantation (AST) and the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) guidelines recommend that potential living kidney donors with a history of kidney stones or nephrolithiasis undergo further evaluation, including a 24-hour urine stone profile.

In this case, performing a 24-hour urine stone profile will help assess the donor's risk of recurrent stone formation. If the profile is normal, it suggests that the stone is an isolated incident, and the donor can be accepted for right donor nephrectomy. This approach is supported by the AST and ASN guidelines, which recommend that donors with a single, small, nonobstructing stone can be considered for donation if they have a normal stone profile.

Option A is incorrect because the presence of a single, small, nonobstructing stone does not necessarily preclude the donor from donation. Option B is incorrect because the donor should undergo further evaluation before being accepted for donation. Option D is incorrect because, if the 24-hour urine stone profile is normal, it would be more reasonable to accept the donor for right donor nephrectomy, as the stone is located in the right kidney.",Success
Which ONE of the following ultraﬁltration goal targets is MOST appropriate to decrease his risk of intradialytic hypotension?,D,"The correct answer is D. < 4% Weight gain.

According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, the ultrafiltration goal target to decrease the risk of intradialytic hypotension is to aim for a weight gain of less than 4% between dialysis sessions. This is because excessive fluid removal during dialysis can lead to hypotension.

In this scenario, the patient requires 6 L of volume removal during dialysis, which is a significant amount. To decrease the risk of intradialytic hypotension, it would be appropriate to aim for a lower ultrafiltration goal, such as < 4% weight gain, to reduce the amount of fluid removed during dialysis and minimize the risk of hypotension.

The other options are not supported by current guidelines and may actually increase the risk of intradialytic hypotension.",Success

Which ONE of the following would be the MOST appropriate to evaluate response to treatment in com-bination with creatinine and proteinuria?",A,"The correct answer is A. Assess for donor-specific antibodies.

The patient has a history of acute antibody-mediated rejection, and the presence of donor-specific antibodies (DSA) is a key factor in this type of rejection. The patient received treatment with plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulins, and rituximab, which aimed to reduce the levels of DSA. To evaluate the response to treatment, it is essential to monitor the levels of DSA.

Assessing for DSA is a widely accepted practice in kidney transplantation, and it is recommended by the Banff classification of renal allograft pathology. The presence or absence of DSA can help determine the effectiveness of treatment and guide further management.

The other options are not directly related to evaluating the response to treatment for antibody-mediated rejection:

B. Tacrolimus trough level is important for monitoring immunosuppressive therapy, but it does not directly assess the response to treatment for antibody-mediated rejection.

C. Mycophenolate mofetil area under the curve is also important for monitoring immunosuppressive therapy, but it is not a direct measure of the response to treatment for antibody-mediated rejection.

D. Urinary chemokines may be a potential biomarker for kidney injury, but it is not a widely established or standardized test for evaluating the response to treatment for antibody-mediated rejection.

Therefore, assessing for donor-specific antibodies is the most appropriate option to evaluate the response to treatment in combination with creatinine and proteinuria.",Success
Which of the following features on histology can help distinguish calciphylaxis from its mimics?,A,"The correct answer is A. Presence of circumferential calcium deposits in hypodermal vessels.

Calciphylaxis, also known as calcific uremic arteriopathy, is a rare but serious complication of end-stage kidney disease. It is characterized by the deposition of calcium in the media of small- and medium-sized arteries, leading to vascular calcification and tissue ischemia.

On histology, the presence of circumferential calcium deposits in hypodermal vessels is a distinctive feature that can help distinguish calciphylaxis from its mimics. This characteristic finding is often seen in the arterioles and small arteries of the skin and subcutaneous tissue.

Option B, presence of noncircumferential calcium deposits, is not specific to calciphylaxis and can be seen in other conditions. Option C, absence of thrombosis, is not a reliable feature to rule in or rule out calciphylaxis, as thrombosis can be present in some cases. Option D, presence of inflammatory infiltrate in cutaneous vessel walls, is not a characteristic feature of calciphylaxis.

It's essential to note that the diagnosis of calciphylaxis should be made in conjunction with clinical and laboratory findings, including the presence of end-stage kidney disease, hyperparathyroidism, and elevated calcium-phosphorus product.",Success
Which of the following statements is MOST correct?,D,"The correct answer is D. Treatment of HIV alone is unlikely to lead to full or partial remission of kidney disease.

Given the patient's history of HIV positivity and antiretroviral therapy, it is essential to consider the possibility of HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). However, the kidney biopsy showing membranous glomerulopathy is not consistent with HIVAN, which typically presents with collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

Membranous glomerulopathy is often associated with autoimmune or malignancy-related causes. The patient's anti-PLA2R antibody titer is pending, which may help diagnose primary membranous nephropathy. However, in the absence of this result, it is essential to consider other potential causes, including malignancy.

Option A is incorrect because the patient should be screened for malignancy, particularly given the membranous glomerulopathy on kidney biopsy.

Option B is incorrect because there is no indication to change the patient's antiviral medications, as his viral load is undetectable, and the kidney disease is not related to his HIV infection.

Option C is incorrect because THSD7 antibody is associated with membranous nephropathy, but it is not the most likely cause in this patient, especially with the pending anti-PLA2R antibody result.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option D, as treatment of HIV alone is unlikely to lead to full or partial remission of kidney disease in this patient, given the membranous glomerulopathy on kidney biopsy.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the BEST option regarding treatment of this patient at this point in the KRT initiation strategy perspective?,D,"The correct answer is D. Close and frequent monitoring of clinical status and laboratory parameters in the ICU and initiate KRT if indication arises.

The patient is experiencing acute kidney injury (AKI) with a creatinine level of 3.1 mg/dl, which is significantly elevated from her admission level of 1.2 mg/dl. Additionally, she has a low urine output of 0.47 ml/kg per hour, indicating oliguria. However, her hemodynamic status is stable, and she is not in septic shock.

The fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is 0.9%, which suggests that the AKI is likely due to intrinsic renal damage rather than pre-renal causes. However, the patient's potassium level is 5.9 mEq/L, which is not life-threatening, and there are no hyperkalemic wave changes on electrocardiography.

Given the patient's stable hemodynamic status and lack of urgent indications for KRT, such as severe hyperkalemia, acidosis, or fluid overload, the best option is to continue close and frequent monitoring of her clinical status and laboratory parameters in the ICU. This will allow for prompt initiation of KRT if her condition deteriorates or if indications arise.

Option A is incorrect because, although the patient has AKI, there are no immediate indications for KRT. Option B is also incorrect because there is no clear timeline for KRT initiation, and the patient's condition should be closely monitored before making a decision. Option C is incorrect because the patient's AKI is significant, and she requires continued ICU-level care and monitoring.",Success
"Question 2787:
Which ONE of the following statements is CORRECT regarding the mortality of patients with ESRD and disorders of glucose metabolism?",A,"The correct answer is A. There is a U-shaped association between hemoglobin A1c levels and mortality.

According to current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices, patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and disorders of glucose metabolism have a complex relationship between hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and mortality. Studies have consistently shown a U-shaped association between HbA1c levels and mortality, meaning that both very low and very high HbA1c levels are associated with increased mortality risk.

This is because very low HbA1c levels may indicate malnutrition or frailty, while very high levels may indicate poor glycemic control and increased risk of cardiovascular events. The optimal HbA1c range for patients with ESRD and diabetes is still a topic of debate, but a U-shaped association is widely recognized.

Option B is incorrect because while there is some evidence suggesting that HbA1c levels between 6% and 7% may be associated with lower mortality, this is not universally accepted, and the relationship is more complex than a simple linear association.

Option C is incorrect because women on dialysis with diabetes tend to have a lower life expectancy compared to men on dialysis with diabetes, not exceeding it.

Option D is incorrect because glucagon-like peptide (GLP) levels have been shown to be associated with mortality in patients with ESRD on long-term hemodialysis (HD), with higher GLP levels being associated with improved survival.",Success
Which ONE of the following would you advise him regarding the effect of parathyroidectomy?,B,"The correct answer is B. He has about a 10% risk of persistent hyperparathyroidism.

Parathyroidectomy is a surgical procedure that can effectively treat severe hyperparathyroidism in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, it's essential to inform the patient about the potential risks and outcomes associated with this procedure.

According to current medical guidelines and studies, the risk of persistent hyperparathyroidism after parathyroidectomy in patients with ESRD is around 10-15% (1, 2). This is due to various factors, including the presence of supernumerary glands, incomplete resection, or recurrence of hyperparathyroidism.

Option A is incorrect because while parathyroidectomy can improve overall health and reduce morbidity, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest a reduced risk of hospitalization specifically for the first year after surgery.

Option C is incorrect because hypocalcemia is a common complication of parathyroidectomy, particularly in the immediate postoperative period. Patients may require calcium supplementation to manage hypocalcemia, which can be severe in some cases (3).

Option D is incorrect because parathyroidectomy has been shown to improve survival and reduce mortality in patients with ESRD and severe hyperparathyroidism (4). While there are risks associated with the procedure, the overall benefit of parathyroidectomy in this patient population is well established.

What is the most likely adverse effect of denosumab to be observed on laboratory tests?,C,"The correct answer is C. Hypocalcemia.

Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), which is involved in osteoclast activation and bone resorption. As a result, denosumab can lead to hypocalcemia, particularly in patients with pre-existing hypocalcemia or vitamin D deficiency.

In this case, the patient's initial laboratory tests showed a low vitamin D concentration (16 ng/ml), which increases the risk of hypocalcemia. Denosumab can further decrease calcium levels by inhibiting bone resorption, leading to a decrease in calcium release from the bone.

The other options are not directly related to the adverse effects of denosumab:

A. Hypercalcemia is not a known adverse effect of denosumab.

B. Acute kidney injury is not a common adverse effect of denosumab, and the patient's creatinine level is already elevated, suggesting underlying kidney disease.

D. Toxic levels of denosumab are not a concern, as the medication is dosed based on body weight and is not typically associated with toxic levels.

It's essential to monitor calcium levels closely in patients receiving denosumab, especially those with pre-existing hypocalcemia or vitamin D deficiency, and to consider calcium and vitamin D supplementation as needed.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell him about his risk for and therapy of kidney disease?,B,"The correct answer is B. Regardless of race, control of glucose levels and BP among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus slows progression of CKD.

This patient is skeptical about the benefits of glucose lowering and hypertension control due to his friend's experience with diabetic nephropathy and dialysis. It's essential to reassure him that controlling glucose levels and blood pressure can slow the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), regardless of race.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) recommend that adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD aim for a blood pressure target of <140/90 mmHg and an A1c target of <7%. Tight control of blood pressure and glucose levels has been shown to slow the progression of CKD in multiple studies, including the UKPDS and ACCORD trials.

Option A is incorrect because while there may be some racial disparities in the effectiveness of certain treatments, the benefits of glucose and blood pressure control in slowing CKD progression are not limited to white adults.

Option C is incorrect because the cumulative lifetime risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) varies depending on several factors, including age, race, and underlying kidney function. A more accurate estimate of this patient's risk would require further evaluation and consideration of multiple factors.

Option D is correct in that APOL1 high-risk variants are associated with more rapid progression of CKD in African Americans, but it's not the most relevant information to address the patient's concerns about the benefits of glucose and blood pressure control.",Success
"In addition to ongoing close follow-up of this woman’s kidney function, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Continue current regimen.

Here's why:

* The patient has responded to the current bumetanide regimen with a urine output of 3 L over 24 hours, indicating some degree of diuresis.
* The estimated sodium output from each dose of bumetanide is 140 mEq, suggesting that the medication is effective in promoting sodium excretion.
* Although the serum creatinine has increased, it is not uncommon for creatinine to rise initially in response to diuretic therapy, especially in patients with heart failure. This increase may be due to volume contraction rather than worsening kidney function.
* The patient's physical examination findings, such as mild respiratory distress and bibasilar crackles, suggest that she still has some degree of volume overload, which warrants continued diuretic therapy.
* Isolated ultrafiltration (Option A) may be considered in refractory cases of heart failure, but it is not necessary at this point, given the patient's response to bumetanide.
* Redosing bumetanide only after the serum creatinine is less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl (Option B) may delay diuretic therapy and potentially worsen volume overload.
* Decreasing the frequency of bumetanide to once daily (Option C) may reduce its effectiveness in promoting diuresis and sodium excretion.

Therefore, continuing the current regimen of bumetanide 3 mg intravenously every 12 hours (Option D) is the most appropriate management at this time, along with close monitoring of the patient's kidney function and volume status.",Success
Which of the following is MOST CORRECT regarding hyperphosphatemia?,A,"The correct answer is A. In the general population, plasma phosphate levels at the upper end of the normal range have been associated with increased cardiovascular mortality.

Explanation:

Hyperphosphatemia is a common complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and it's associated with increased cardiovascular mortality. In the general population, even plasma phosphate levels at the upper end of the normal range (4.3 mg/dl in this case) have been linked to increased cardiovascular mortality. This is because high phosphate levels can promote vascular calcification, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, all of which contribute to cardiovascular disease.

Option B is incorrect because FGF-23 levels increase early in CKD, even before eGFR levels decrease below 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, to help regulate phosphate levels.

Option C is incorrect because metabolic or respiratory acidosis, not alkalosis, is associated with hyperphosphatemia.

Option D is incorrect because dietary phosphate in food additives can be highly bioavailable, which can contribute to hyperphosphatemia, especially in patients with CKD.

In this patient's case, her plasma phosphate level of 4.3 mg/dl, although within the normal range, may still be a concern given her CKD and albuminuria. Her PCP should consider monitoring her phosphate levels and advising her on a phosphate-restricted diet to reduce her cardiovascular risk.",Success
"Question 2466:
Which ONE of the following statements is CORRECT regarding potassium intake, hypertension, and cardiovascular risk?",D,"The correct answer is D. Low dietary potassium promotes hypertension by increasing the activity of the sodium chloride cotransporter (on a high sodium diet).

Explanation:

Research has shown that low dietary potassium intake is associated with an increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. One of the mechanisms by which this occurs is by increasing the activity of the sodium chloride cotransporter, which leads to increased sodium reabsorption in the kidneys and subsequent blood pressure elevation. This effect is more pronounced in individuals who consume a high-sodium diet.

The other options are incorrect:

A. While high potassium intake may help lower blood pressure, it is not exclusive to individuals with low sodium intake.

B. Low potassium intake is associated with an increased risk of both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.

C. High dietary potassium does result in natriuresis (increased sodium excretion), but it is not solely due to decreasing aldosterone secretion. Other mechanisms, such as increased sodium chloride cotransporter activity, also play a role.

E. Dietary potassium does have a significant role in blood pressure regulation, as evidenced by the numerous studies demonstrating the beneficial effects of potassium supplementation on blood pressure.

Which of the following is true regarding suboptimal adherence to antihypertensive medication?,D,"The correct answer is C. Smartphone apps that provide reminder alerts, adherence reports, and peer support may lead to improved BP control.

Suboptimal adherence to antihypertensive medication is a significant issue, and studies have shown that using technology-based interventions, such as smartphone apps, can improve blood pressure control. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that mobile health (mHealth) interventions, including smartphone apps, significantly improved blood pressure control in patients with hypertension (1).

While options B and D are related to medication adherence, they do not directly address the question about suboptimal adherence leading to improved blood pressure control. Option A underestimates the prevalence of nonadherence, which is estimated to be around 50% or higher in some studies (2).

In this patient's case, using a smartphone app that provides reminder alerts, adherence reports, and peer support may help improve his medication adherence and, ultimately, his blood pressure control.

Which ONE of the following statements BEST describes his renal status?,B,"The correct answer is C. Stage 3 AKI.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria for acute kidney injury (AKI), the patient's rise in serum creatinine from 1.4 mg/dl to 3.0 mg/dl represents a greater than 3-fold increase, which meets the criteria for Stage 3 AKI.

Here's a brief summary of the KDIGO stages of AKI:

* Stage 1 AKI: Serum creatinine increases by 0.3 mg/dl or more within 48 hours, or increases to 1.5-1.9 times the baseline value.
* Stage 2 AKI: Serum creatinine increases to 2-2.9 times the baseline value.
* Stage 3 AKI: Serum creatinine increases to 3 times the baseline value, or increases to ≥4 mg/dl, or the patient requires renal replacement therapy.

In this case, the patient's significant increase in serum creatinine and BUN, despite achieving a net negative fluid output, suggests that his kidneys are not responding adequately to the diuretic therapy, and he has developed Stage 3 AKI.

Type 5 cardiorenal syndrome refers to a condition where there is simultaneous heart and kidney dysfunction, but it is not a specific stage of AKI.",Success
Which of the following statements is true regarding the association between socioeconomic status and hypertension?,B,"The correct answer is A. Across all economic regions, hypertension is more common among individuals of lower socioeconomic status.

Research has consistently shown that there is an inverse relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and hypertension. Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to have a higher prevalence of hypertension compared to those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds. This is likely due to a variety of factors, including limited access to healthcare, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and increased stress levels.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that low- and middle-income countries bear a disproportionate burden of hypertension, with approximately 80% of all hypertension-related deaths occurring in these regions. Within these countries, individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are often at higher risk due to limited access to healthcare, education, and healthy living conditions.

Option B is partially correct, as hypertension is often correlated with the prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity. However, this statement does not specifically address the relationship between socioeconomic status and hypertension.

Option C is incorrect, as individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to have a higher risk of both hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

Option D is also incorrect, as control of hypertension is often lower among individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds due to limited access to healthcare and other resources.",Success
Peritoneal ﬂuid analysis shows a cell count of 45 total nucleated cells/mm3 with 36% neutrophils Which ONE of the following is the next MOST appropriate step in management?,A,"The correct answer is A. Repeat the cell count after infusing 1 L of dialysate that dwells for 1–2 hours.

The patient's symptoms and peritoneal fluid analysis suggest possible peritonitis, a common complication of peritoneal dialysis. The cell count of 45 total nucleated cells/mm3 with 36% neutrophils is not diagnostic of peritonitis, as the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) recommends a threshold of ≥100 cells/mm3 with ≥50% neutrophils to diagnose peritonitis.

To further evaluate the patient, it is necessary to repeat the cell count after infusing a larger volume of dialysate (1 L) and allowing it to dwell for 1-2 hours. This will help to clarify whether the initial results were due to a sampling error or if the patient indeed has peritonitis.

Option B, checking serum complement levels, is not relevant to the diagnosis of peritonitis. Option C, obtaining a CT scan, may be necessary if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, but it is not the next most appropriate step in management. Option D, discharging the patient home and repeating the cell count in 24 hours, is not appropriate, as the patient's symptoms and peritoneal fluid analysis suggest a possible infection that requires further evaluation and management.",Success
"Based on published data, which of the following biomarkers has the best chance of identifying incipient acute tubular necrosis in a patient undergoing cardiac bypass?",C,"Based on published data, the correct answer is A. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL).

NGAL is a biomarker that has been extensively studied and shown to be a sensitive and specific indicator of acute kidney injury (AKI), including incipient acute tubular necrosis. It is a protein that is rapidly induced in the kidneys in response to injury and can be detected in the urine and blood within hours of injury.

Multiple studies have demonstrated that NGAL is a reliable biomarker for predicting AKI in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, including cardiac bypass. A 2011 meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology found that NGAL was a strong predictor of AKI in cardiac surgery patients, with a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 85%.

While the other options have also been studied as potential biomarkers for AKI, the evidence is not as strong as it is for NGAL. KIM-1 is a biomarker that has been shown to be associated with AKI, but it is not as sensitive or specific as NGAL. TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 are biomarkers that have been studied in combination (as [TIMP-2] • [IGFBP7]) and have been shown to be predictive of AKI, but the evidence is not as robust as it is for NGAL. NAG is an enzyme that is often elevated in AKI, but it is not as specific or sensitive as NGAL.

Therefore, based on the current evidence, NGAL is the biomarker with the best chance of identifying incipient acute tubular necrosis in a patient undergoing cardiac bypass.",Success
Which ONE of the following questions will be MOST helpful to you in providing the patient with an immediate answer?,D,"The correct answer is C. What was the patient's eGFR when treatment was started.

The patient's eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) at the start of treatment is a crucial factor in determining their likelihood of requiring permanent renal replacement therapy. A lower eGFR indicates more advanced kidney disease, and patients with lower eGFRs are more likely to progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis.

While the other options are important in understanding the patient's overall kidney health, they are not as directly relevant to predicting the need for permanent renal replacement therapy:

A. Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy on kidney biopsy can indicate chronic kidney damage, but it's not as directly correlated with the need for dialysis as eGFR.

B. Proteinuria (excess protein in the urine) is a sign of kidney damage, but its severity and impact on renal function can vary widely.

D. The patient's hematologic response to therapy is important for managing their light-chain amyloidosis, but it's not directly related to their likelihood of requiring dialysis.

By asking about the patient's eGFR at the start of treatment, you can get a quick sense of their kidney function and provide a more informed answer to their question about the likelihood of requiring permanent renal replacement therapy.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment for a patient with dialysis-dependent light chain crystalline cast nephropathy?,C,"The correct answer is C. Clone directed therapy of the paraproteinemia.

The patient's diagnosis of light chain crystalline cast nephropathy, a type of multiple myeloma, requires urgent treatment to reduce the production of the toxic light chains causing kidney damage. Clone-directed therapy, such as bortezomib-based regimens, is the most appropriate initial treatment to target the underlying paraproteinemia and reduce light chain production. This approach can help improve kidney function and potentially reverse the acute kidney injury (AKI).

While plasmapheresis (Option A) may be considered as an adjunctive therapy to remove circulating light chains, it is not the primary treatment for this condition. Peritoneal dialysis (Option B) is not the best initial treatment, as it may not be effective in removing the light chains and may not address the underlying disease. High-cutoff hemodialysis (Option D) is a type of dialysis that can remove light chains, but it is not a substitute for clone-directed therapy. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Option E) may be considered in the future, but it is not the initial treatment of choice for this patient.

It's essential to note that the patient's oligoanuric AKI will require concurrent management with dialysis, but the primary focus should be on treating the underlying paraproteinemia with clone-directed therapy.",Success
Genetic testing is expected to have the highest diagnostic yield in which of the following kidney dis-ease phenotypes?,D,"The correct answer is D. Congenital or cystic kidney disease.

Genetic testing has a high diagnostic yield in congenital or cystic kidney diseases, such as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) or autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). These diseases are often caused by mutations in specific genes, such as PKD1 or PKD2, and genetic testing can help identify the underlying genetic defect.

In contrast, diabetic kidney disease (A) is a complication of diabetes and is not typically caused by a single genetic mutation. Glomerulopathy (B) is a heterogeneous group of diseases that can have various causes, including genetic, immune-mediated, and infectious factors, making genetic testing less likely to yield a diagnosis. Tubulointerstitial disease (C) is also a heterogeneous group of diseases, and genetic testing is not typically the first line of diagnosis.

In this scenario, since the patient presents with multiple cysts in both kidneys, genetic testing for ADPKD or ARPKD may be a reasonable next step to determine the underlying cause of his condition.",Success
"Regarding the treatment and outcome of anti-GBM disease in this patient, which of the following is MOST correct?",B,"The correct answer is C. Following treatment with plasma exchange, cyclophosphamide, and glucocorticoids, recovery from dialysis-dependent renal failure can be expected in approximately 30% of cases.

Explanation:

Anti-GBM disease is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against the glomerular basement membrane. The patient's presentation, laboratory results, and renal biopsy findings are consistent with anti-GBM disease.

The treatment of anti-GBM disease typically involves a combination of plasma exchange, immunosuppressive therapy (cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids), and supportive care. Plasma exchange helps remove the circulating anti-GBM antibodies, while immunosuppressive therapy aims to suppress the production of these antibodies.

Regarding the outcome, studies have shown that approximately 30% of patients with dialysis-dependent renal failure at presentation can recover renal function with timely and aggressive treatment. This is supported by a systematic review and meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases (AJKD) in 2019.

The other options are incorrect:

A. Lung hemorrhage is a common complication of anti-GBM disease, but its presence is not directly associated with poorer renal outcome.

B. Pulse intravenous cyclophosphamide is often preferred over daily oral dosing due to its more predictable pharmacokinetics and potentially lower toxicity.

D. Imliﬁdase is a B-cell depleting agent that has been studied in the treatment of anti-GBM disease, but there is no randomized controlled trial showing its superiority over plasma exchange for the rapid removal of anti-GBM antibodies.

E. Maintenance immunosuppression is typically required to prevent relapses and promote long-term remission in patients with anti-GBM disease.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?,D,"The correct answer is C. Discontinue empagliﬂozin.

The patient's eGFR has declined significantly over the past year, and she has developed stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD). Empagliﬂozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR < 45 ml/min. The FDA recommends discontinuing empagliﬂozin when the eGFR falls below 45 ml/min due to the increased risk of adverse effects, including acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia.

Metformin (Option B) can be continued, as it is generally safe in patients with CKD, and the patient's eGFR is still above 30 ml/min. However, close monitoring of renal function is necessary.

There is no indication to discontinue esomeprazole (Option D) or switch to ranitidine, as the patient's gastroesophageal reflux disease is well-controlled, and esomeprazole is not contributing to her CKD progression.

Option A, ""No change in management,"" is not appropriate, as the patient's declining eGFR requires adjustments to her medication regimen.

It is essential to note that the patient's CKD requires close monitoring, and her medication regimen should be regularly reassessed to ensure optimal management of her comorbidities.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements is FALSE regarding her lack of antibody response to vaccine?,A,"The correct answer is E. Her induction treatment with antithymocyte globulin does not decrease her response to vaccination.

Explanation:

* Option A is true: Advanced age can impair the immune response to vaccination.
* Option B is true: High-dose mycophenolate mofetil, an immunosuppressive medication, can impair the development of an antibody response to vaccination.
* Option C is true: Solid organ transplant recipients, including kidney transplant patients, often have a decreased response to vaccination due to their immunosuppressed state.
* Option D is true: Studies have shown that after a third dose of mRNA vaccine, 25% to 70% of transplant recipients experience an increase in antispike SARS-CoV-2 IgG.

However, Option E is false: Antithymocyte globulin, used for induction in this patient, is a potent immunosuppressive agent that can decrease the response to vaccination. It is known to deplete T cells and impair immune function, which can affect the ability to mount an antibody response to vaccination.

In this scenario, the patient's lack of antibody response to the COVID-19 vaccine may be attributed to her immunosuppressed state, high-dose mycophenolate mofetil, and previous treatment with antithymocyte globulin.",Success
"A. IgA nephropathy
B. Nutcracker syndrome
C. Hypercalciuria
D. Urethral tear
E. Thin basement membrane nephropathy
likely to receive inpatient palliative care services based on data from the United States National Inpatient Sample Data?",A,"The correct answer is A. IgA nephropathy.

The patient's presentation with persistent asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, elevated urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and dysmorphic erythrocytes on urinalysis suggests a glomerular origin of the hematuria. IgA nephropathy is a common cause of glomerular hematuria, particularly in individuals of Asian descent. The presence of dysmorphic erythrocytes, which are characteristic of glomerular bleeding, supports this diagnosis.

Thin basement membrane nephropathy (option E) can also cause hematuria, but it is typically benign and does not usually present with proteinuria or dysmorphic erythrocytes.

Nutcracker syndrome (option B) is a rare condition that causes hematuria due to compression of the left renal vein, but it is unlikely to cause proteinuria or dysmorphic erythrocytes.

Hypercalciuria (option C) can cause hematuria, but it is typically associated with kidney stones or other underlying kidney diseases, which are not evident in this patient.

Urethral tear (option D) is an unlikely cause of hematuria in this patient, as it would typically present with symptoms such as pain or difficulty urinating, which are not mentioned in the scenario.

It's worth noting that a kidney biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy.",Success
Which ONE of the following interventions would you recommend as MOST likely to decrease the risk of progression to severe AKI in patients receiving aminoglycosides?,D,"Based on current evidence and guidelines, I would recommend option D: Daily serum creatinine measurements.

Aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity is a significant concern, and early detection of acute kidney injury (AKI) is crucial to prevent progression to severe AKI. Daily serum creatinine measurements can help identify patients who are developing AKI at an early stage, allowing for prompt intervention and potential mitigation of further kidney damage.

The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines recommend monitoring serum creatinine at least daily in patients receiving aminoglycosides, especially in those at high risk of AKI. Early detection of AKI enables healthcare providers to adjust medication, optimize fluid management, and consider alternative therapies, thereby reducing the risk of progression to severe AKI.

While electronic alerts (option A) can be useful in identifying patients at risk, they are not a direct intervention to prevent progression to severe AKI. Measuring aminoglycoside levels (option B) is important for optimizing dosing, but it may not directly impact the progression of AKI. Preferential use of a three times daily dosing regimen (option C) may help reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity, but it is not the most effective intervention to prevent progression to severe AKI.

Therefore, I recommend daily serum creatinine measurements as the most effective intervention to decrease the risk of progression to severe AKI in patients receiving aminoglycosides.",Success
What is the next best step in the management of his bone disease?,B,"The correct answer is B. Initiate denosumab.

Rationale:

* Pamidronate, a bisphosphonate, is known to cause nephrotoxicity, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment (eGFR 25 mL/min in this case).
* The development of nephrotic-range proteinuria after pamidronate administration and its improvement after holding the medication suggest a causal relationship.
* Zoledronate, another bisphosphonate, may also cause nephrotoxicity and is not a suitable alternative in this scenario (Option A).
* Rechallenging the patient with pamidronate (Option C) is not recommended due to the risk of recurrent nephrotoxicity.
* Denosumab, a RANK ligand inhibitor, is a suitable alternative for managing bone disease in multiple myeloma patients, especially those with renal impairment. It has a more favorable renal safety profile compared to bisphosphonates (Option B).
* Discontinuing antiresorptive therapy permanently (Option D) may not be necessary, as denosumab can provide effective management of bone disease while minimizing the risk of nephrotoxicity.

According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines, denosumab is a recommended option for the management of bone disease in multiple myeloma patients, particularly those with renal impairment.",Success
Which of the following statements is likely to be true regarding the case presentation?,D,"The correct answer is D. In addition to mild ATN from the viral syndrome, she has diabetic nephropathy with histologic changes that preceded clinical evidence such as eGFR decline or albuminuria.

The biopsy results showing GBM thickening, severe mesangial expansion, and nodular sclerosis are consistent with diabetic nephropathy. The presence of mild acute tubular necrosis (ATN) suggests that the recent viral illness may have contributed to the acute kidney injury, which is supported by the elevated creatinine level.

The patient's history of ""borderline diabetes"" treated with metformin and diet, along with the absence of retinopathy, does not necessarily imply that she is an inaccurate historian or that her diabetes was more severe (option A). Additionally, the primary care physician's screening for microalbuminuria may have been adequate, and the absence of albuminuria does not rule out diabetic nephropathy (option B).

There is no indication to suggest that the biopsy was mislabeled and should be repeated (option C). The biopsy results are consistent with the patient's clinical presentation and medical history, and repeating the biopsy would not likely change the diagnosis.

It is important to note that diabetic nephropathy can occur in the absence of albuminuria or retinopathy, and the biopsy results confirm the diagnosis. The patient's creatinine level decreasing to 1.4 mg/dL by the time the biopsy was performed suggests that the acute kidney injury from the viral illness may be resolving, but the underlying diabetic nephropathy remains.",Success
"In addition to ongoing lifestyle modification, which ONE of the following options would represent your BEST recommendation to him?",D,"The correct answer is D. You should inform him that his cardiovascular risk is increased and that you recommend that he start drug treatment.

According to the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, the patient's average home BP of 126/97 mmHg indicates stage 1 hypertension, which requires treatment. Isolated diastolic hypertension, defined as a diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg and a systolic BP <130 mmHg, is a recognized risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

The patient's family history of premature myocardial infarctions and his own elevated diastolic BP despite lifestyle modifications increase his cardiovascular risk. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend initiating antihypertensive drug treatment in patients with stage 1 hypertension who have a high cardiovascular risk, as is the case with this patient.

Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they downplay the significance of the patient's elevated diastolic BP and do not align with current guidelines for hypertension management.",Success
"Vital signs: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): E2V2M2 (Eye response, opens eyes in response to pain; Verbal response, makes sounds; Motor response, extension to painful stimuli); BP 130/76 mm Hg (supine position), pulse rate 70 beats/min, respiratory rate 18/min, SpO2 95% (room air), temperature 36.5 degree C, weight 63 kg (+3 kg more than usual)
Blood: total protein 7.3 g/dl, albumin 4.2 g/dl, BUN 12 mg/dl, creatinine 0.7 mg/dl, uric acid 3.0 mg/dl, Na 121 mmol/L, K 4.0 mmol/L, Cl 87 mmol/L, glucose 250 mg/dl, osmolality 260 mOsm/kg H2O
Urine: osmolality 450 mOsm/kg H2O
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely cause of this patient’s seizures?",B,"The correct answer is B. Exercise-associated hyponatremia.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the seizures, and laboratory results suggest exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH). Here's why:

1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level is 121 mmol/L, which is below the normal range (135-145 mmol/L). This indicates hyponatremia, a condition characterized by low sodium levels in the blood.
2. Seizures: Hyponatremia can cause seizures, especially when the sodium level drops rapidly.
3. Weight gain: The patient's weight has increased by 3 kg, suggesting excessive fluid intake during the marathon.
4. Urine osmolality: The urine osmolality is 450 mOsm/kg H2O, which is higher than the serum osmolality (260 mOsm/kg H2O). This indicates that the kidneys are trying to excrete excess water, but the patient is still hyponatremic.
5. Lack of other explanations: The patient's other laboratory results do not suggest dehydration (A), volume depletion (E), or hyperglycemia (D) as the cause of her seizures. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (C) is not supported by the provided information.

Exercise-associated hyponatremia is a well-known complication of endurance sports, particularly in individuals who excessively consume water during prolonged exercise. It occurs when the body takes in more water than it can process, causing an imbalance in electrolytes and leading to hyponatremia. In this case, the patient's frequent water intake during the marathon likely contributed to her hyponatremia and subsequent seizures.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you report about the use of lung ultrasonography and on-line optical technology?,B,"The correct answer is B. Moderate interstitial lung edema by lung ultrasonography is associated with increased risk of death.

Lung ultrasonography (LUS) has been shown to be a valuable tool in assessing volume status in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). Studies have demonstrated that LUS can accurately detect interstitial lung edema, which is a common complication of fluid overload in these patients. Moderate interstitial lung edema detected by LUS has been associated with an increased risk of death, highlighting the importance of accurate volume assessment and management in this population.

Option A is incorrect because LUS has been shown to be more sensitive and specific than clinical assessment (absence of crackles and peripheral edema) in detecting interstitial lung edema.

Option C is incorrect because on-line optical technology, which measures changes in hematocrit and plasma refraction, has been shown to be inferior to LUS in assessing volume status.

Option D is incorrect because LUS is not a reliable tool to detect underhydration. While LUS can detect fluid overload, it is not as effective in detecting dehydration or underhydration.",Success
Which of the following is the best approach to this patient’s BP measurement?,A,"The correct answer is A. Recommend that he undergo 24-hour ABPM.

Here's why:

The patient's labile blood pressure (BP) readings at home, ranging from 80s/30s mmHg to 190s/110s mmHg, raise concerns about the accuracy of the cuffless watch device. While the device may have been advertised as top-notch, its accuracy has not been clinically validated. In fact, the American Heart Association (AHA) and other reputable organizations have expressed concerns about the accuracy of cuffless BP monitoring devices.

The best approach is to recommend 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), which is a gold standard for evaluating BP variability and diagnosing hypertension. ABPM provides a more accurate and comprehensive picture of the patient's BP patterns over a 24-hour period, including during sleep and daily activities.

Option B is incorrect because, despite marketing claims, the accuracy of cuffless BP devices has not been clinically proven. Option C is not the best approach, as autonomic dysfunction is a specific condition that requires a more thorough evaluation, and the patient's symptoms do not necessarily suggest this diagnosis. Option D, kiosk-based BP measurement, may not provide a complete picture of the patient's BP patterns and may not be as accurate as ABPM.

By recommending 24-hour ABPM, the healthcare provider can obtain a more accurate assessment of the patient's BP and make informed decisions about further evaluation and management.",Success
"Which ONE of the following is associated with the highest 5-year risk of stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and death for this patient?",D,"The correct answer is A. A discharge systolic BP of > 140 mmHg.

According to the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines, for patients with a history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, the goal is to reduce blood pressure to < 130/80 mmHg to prevent recurrent stroke. However, for patients with a history of lacunar infarcts (small, deep infarcts, which is likely the case for this patient given the left middle cerebral artery infarct), the goal is to reduce blood pressure to < 130 mmHg.

A discharge systolic BP of > 140 mmHg is associated with a higher risk of stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and death. In fact, the SPS3 trial showed that in patients with lacunar infarcts, a target systolic BP of < 130 mmHg reduced the risk of recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events compared to a target of < 150 mmHg.

Options B and C are both acceptable goals for blood pressure control in this patient, but they do not have the highest 5-year risk of stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and death. Option D, maintenance of systolic BP < 120 mmHg, is not a recommended goal for this patient, as it may lead to hypotension and decreased perfusion to vital organs.",Success
Which of the following statements regarding management of metabolic acidosis is true?,A,"The correct answer is A. In a study of CKD patients followed for > 6 months, treatment with veverimer was associated with improvements in objective measurements of physical function.

Explanation:

The patient's serum bicarbonate level of 19 mEq/ml indicates metabolic acidosis, which is a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The management of metabolic acidosis in CKD patients is crucial to slow down disease progression and improve patient outcomes.

Option A is correct because veverimer, a novel oral potassium-binding polymer, has been shown to improve physical function in CKD patients with metabolic acidosis. A study published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology found that treatment with veverimer for more than 6 months was associated with significant improvements in objective measurements of physical function, such as grip strength and walking speed.

Option B is incorrect because while sodium bicarbonate is often used to treat metabolic acidosis, the optimal dosing and tolerability of this therapy are still being studied. A study published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology found that treatment with 0.8 mEq per lean body weight per day of sodium bicarbonate was associated with more adverse events than 0.5 mEq per lean body weight per day and placebo.

Option C is incorrect because alkali therapy, including sodium bicarbonate and other agents, has been associated with delayed CKD progression in several studies.

Option D is incorrect because while sodium bicarbonate may be effective in treating metabolic acidosis, its safety and efficacy in patients with advanced heart failure are not well established. In fact, sodium bicarbonate can cause volume overload and worsen heart failure in some patients.",Success
"Question 2811:
Which ONE of the following is of LEAST value for discriminating pure diabetic nephropathy from a nondiabetic glomerular lesion in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and overt proteinuria?",C,"The correct answer is C. Magnitude of proteinuria.

Here's why:

In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and overt proteinuria, it can be challenging to distinguish pure diabetic nephropathy from a nondiabetic glomerular lesion. While proteinuria is a hallmark of diabetic nephropathy, its magnitude is not a reliable discriminator between the two conditions.

On the other hand, the duration of diagnosed diabetes mellitus (Option A) can be helpful in this distinction, as diabetic nephropathy typically develops after many years of diabetes. The presence of proliferative retinopathy (Option B) is also a strong indicator of diabetic nephropathy, as both microvascular complications often coexist. Finally, the presence of glomerular hematuria (Option D) is more suggestive of a nondiabetic glomerular lesion, as diabetic nephropathy typically presents with non-nephrotic range proteinuria and minimal hematuria.

Current guidelines and evidence-based practices support the use of these clinical features to help differentiate between diabetic nephropathy and nondiabetic glomerular lesions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate treatment recommendation?,C,"Based on the patient's diagnosis of PR3-ANCA–associated small vessel vasculitis with pauci-immune necrotizing GN and focal crescents, the most appropriate treatment recommendation is:

B. Intravenous cyclophosphamide plus plasma-pheresis

This patient has a severe form of ANCA-associated vasculitis with renal involvement, as evidenced by the presence of erythrocyte casts and elevated serum creatinine level. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines recommend induction therapy with cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids for severe ANCA-associated vasculitis. The addition of plasmapheresis is also recommended for patients with severe renal involvement, as it has been shown to improve renal outcomes.

Rituximab (option C) is an alternative to cyclophosphamide for induction therapy, but it is not typically used in combination with plasmapheresis. Mycophenolate mofetil (option D) is not a recommended induction therapy for severe ANCA-associated vasculitis. Option A, no additional immunosuppressive therapy, is not appropriate given the severity of the patient's disease.

It's worth noting that the patient has already received pulse steroid therapy with methylprednisolone, which is a common practice in the management of ANCA-associated vasculitis. However, this is not a substitute for more specific immunosuppressive therapy, and further treatment is necessary to induce remission and prevent long-term complications.",Success
"After successful transition to dialysis access through the arteriovenous ﬁstula, which ONE of the following outcomes is MOST likely to occur?",C,"The correct answer is C. An improvement in serum albumin.

After transitioning to dialysis access through the arteriovenous fistula, the patient is likely to experience an improvement in serum albumin levels. This is because arteriovenous fistulas are associated with better outcomes, including improved nutrition and reduced inflammation, which can lead to increased serum albumin levels.

Studies have shown that patients who transition from central venous catheters to arteriovenous fistulas or grafts tend to have improved nutritional status, including increased serum albumin levels (1, 2). This is likely due to the reduced risk of infection and inflammation associated with arteriovenous fistulas compared to central venous catheters.

The other options are not supported by evidence:

A. There is no clear association between transitioning to an arteriovenous fistula and a decrease in hemoglobin levels.

B. The leukocyte count is not expected to increase with the transition to an arteriovenous fistula.

D. Erythropoietin requirement may actually decrease with the transition to an arteriovenous fistula, as the risk of inflammation and blood loss is reduced.

E. The transition to an arteriovenous fistula is actually associated with improved survival outcomes, not a decreased likelihood of survival (3).

Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate treatment for this patient?,A,"Based on the patient's presentation and kidney biopsy results, the most appropriate treatment for this patient is:

A. Oral angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)

Here's why:

* The patient has proteinuria (3.6 g/d) and mildly elevated serum creatinine (1.45 mg/dl), indicating kidney damage.
* The kidney biopsy reveals focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) with 19 glomeruli, three of which are globally sclerotic, and minor podocyte foot process effacement on electron microscopy. This suggests that the patient has a primary FSGS, which is a common cause of proteinuria in adolescents.
* The absence of glomerular hypertrophy and negative immunofluorescence studies support the diagnosis of primary FSGS.
* The patient's hypertension (BP 139/88 mmHg) and obesity (BMI 31 kg/m2) are also contributing factors to his kidney disease.

In this scenario, the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) and the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) recommend using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as first-line therapy to reduce proteinuria and slow disease progression. ARBs are a suitable choice in this case, as they have been shown to be effective in reducing proteinuria and improving kidney outcomes in patients with FSGS.

The other options are not supported by the patient's presentation and biopsy results:

* High-dose steroids (Option B) may be used in some cases of FSGS, but they are not the first-line treatment, and the patient's biopsy results do not suggest a strong inflammatory component.
* Mycophenolatemofetil plus low-dose steroids (Option C) is typically used in more severe cases of FSGS or in patients with significant inflammation, which is not evident in this patient.
* Corticotropin injection gel (Option D) is not a standard treatment for FSGS or proteinuria.
* Cyclosporine plus low-dose steroids (Option E) may be used in some cases of FSGS, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient, given the lack of significant inflammation and the potential side effects of cyclosporine.",Success
Which ONE of the following factors is MOST likely to predict failure of arteriovenous maturation in this patient?,E,"The correct answer is A. Preexisting neointimal hyperplasia in the ﬁstula vein biopsy specimen taken at the time of surgery.

According to current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices, preexisting neointimal hyperplasia in the fistula vein is a significant predictor of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation failure. Neointimal hyperplasia is a process of abnormal smooth muscle cell proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition, which can lead to vascular stenosis and occlusion, ultimately resulting in AVF failure.

The other options are not directly related to predicting AVF maturation failure:

B. Failure to perform preoperative vessel mapping may increase the risk of technical difficulties during surgery, but it is not a direct predictor of AVF maturation failure.

C. Predialysis care < 12 months may be a factor in the patient's overall health, but it is not specifically related to AVF maturation.

D. The surgeon's experience (> 25 fistulas during surgical training) may influence the technical success of the procedure, but it is not a direct predictor of AVF maturation failure.

E. The patient's gender (female) is not a significant predictor of AVF maturation failure.

It's essential to note that a thorough preoperative evaluation, including vessel mapping and assessment of the patient's overall health, is crucial for optimizing the chances of successful AVF creation and maturation.",Success
Which of the following is FALSE regarding diuretics in this scenario?,B,"The correct answer is C. Potassium-sparing diuretics should be used only with caution.

In this scenario, the patient has stage 4 CKD and is at risk for hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels). Potassium-sparing diuretics, such as spironolactone or eplerenone, can increase potassium levels and are contraindicated in patients with advanced CKD. Therefore, it's not just a matter of using them with caution, but rather they should be avoided altogether.

The other options are true:

A. Loop diuretics, such as furosemide, are effective in reducing fluid overload and lowering blood pressure in patients with advanced CKD.

B. Thiazide diuretics are indeed ineffective in patients with an eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, as they require a certain level of kidney function to work effectively.

D. Close monitoring of serum electrolytes and kidney function is essential when starting or adjusting the dose of diuretics, especially in patients with CKD, to prevent complications such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and worsening kidney function.",Success
Which of the following therapeutic approaches should be considered in this patient's management?,A,"The correct answer is A. Avoid hypercalcemia.

The patient's CT scan shows abdominal aortic calcification and bilateral iliac artery calcification, which are indicative of vascular calcification. This is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, particularly those with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.

Vascular calcification is accelerated by hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and elevated calcium-phosphorus product. To slow down or prevent further vascular calcification, it is essential to avoid hypercalcemia. This can be achieved by:

1. Monitoring and controlling calcium levels through dietary restrictions and adjustments to calcium-based phosphate binders.
2. Avoiding excessive calcium supplementation.
3. Considering non-calcium-based phosphate binders, such as sevelamer or lanthanum, if necessary.

The other options are not directly related to managing vascular calcification in this patient:

B. Inducing hypophosphatemia is not a recommended therapeutic approach, as it may lead to other complications.

C. Supplementing vitamin K may be beneficial in preventing vascular calcification, but it is not a primary consideration in this patient's management.

D. Sodium thiosulfate infusion is not a recognized treatment for vascular calcification in ESRD patients.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, managing mineral and bone disorder in CKD patients involves controlling calcium and phosphorus levels, as well as maintaining a balanced calcium-phosphorus product. Avoiding hypercalcemia is a crucial aspect of this management strategy.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management for this patient?,D,"The correct answer is D. Cinacalcet.

This patient is experiencing frequent pain in multiple joints and has a history of severe peripheral vascular disease, coronary artery disease, renal artery stenosis, and chronic atrial fibrillation. Her laboratory results show elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and intact PTH levels, indicating secondary hyperparathyroidism, a common complication of end-stage renal disease. The DEXA scan results show severe osteoporosis.

Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent that is specifically approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis. It works by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor, thereby reducing PTH production and secretion. Cinacalcet has been shown to reduce the risk of fractures and improve bone density in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Denosumab (Option A) is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits RANKL, a protein involved in osteoclast activation and bone resorption. While it is used to treat osteoporosis, it is not specifically indicated for secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Increasing calcium acetate (Option B) may further exacerbate the patient's hypercalcemia and worsen her secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Zoledronic acid (Option C) is a bisphosphonate that is used to treat osteoporosis, but it is not specifically indicated for secondary hyperparathyroidism and may not address the underlying PTH dysregulation.

Increasing paricalcitol (Option E) may not address the underlying PTH dysregulation and may lead to further hypercalcemia.

Therefore, cinacalcet is the most appropriate management option for this patient.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements about this patient’s risk for recurrent glomerular disease after transplantation is most CORRECT?,B,"The correct answer is A. Kidney biopsy should be performed now to help assess his risk for recurrent glomerular disease.

This patient's history of hematuria and proteinuria since age 18, along with his current presentation with atrophic kidneys and nephrotic-range proteinuria, suggests that he may have an underlying glomerular disease. Without a definitive diagnosis, it is difficult to assess his risk for recurrent glomerular disease after transplantation.

Performing a kidney biopsy now can help identify the underlying cause of his ESRD, which is essential in determining his risk for recurrent disease after transplantation. This information will also guide his post-transplant management and inform his prognosis.

The other options are not correct:

B. While recurrent glomerular disease can be a significant cause of transplant failure, the exact percentage of transplants failing due to recurrent disease varies depending on the specific disease and other factors.

C. There is no evidence to suggest that the risk of recurrent glomerular disease is lower with a living related donor compared to a deceased donor transplant.

D. The allograft prognosis is not necessarily worse with a living donor versus a deceased donor transplant due to the risk of recurrent glomerular disease. In fact, living donor transplants often have better outcomes due to shorter cold ischemia times and better HLA matching.",Success
"Question 2539:
In a patient presenting with membranoproliferative GN who has no serologic evidence of hepatitis B or C infection and whose biopsy shows predominantly IgM on immunoﬂuorescence, which ONE of the following diagnoses should be seriously considered?",B,"The correct answer is B. An underlying autoimmune disorder.

Here's why:

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a type of glomerular disease characterized by thickening of the glomerular capillary walls and proliferation of mesangial cells. In this scenario, the patient has no serologic evidence of hepatitis B or C infection, which are common causes of MPGN.

The presence of predominantly IgM on immunofluorescence suggests an immune complex-mediated disease. In the absence of hepatitis, the next most likely diagnosis to consider is an underlying autoimmune disorder, such as lupus nephritis or cryoglobulinemia. These conditions can cause MPGN and are often associated with IgM deposits on immunofluorescence.

Option A, occult hepatitis B, is unlikely given the patient's negative serology. Option C, solid organ cancer, is not typically associated with MPGN or IgM deposits. Option D, cocaine abuse, is not a known cause of MPGN or IgM deposits.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American Society of Nephrology and the National Kidney Foundation, recommend considering autoimmune disorders in the differential diagnosis of MPGN, especially in the absence of infectious causes.",Success
Which of the following is NOT associated with SGLT2 inhibitors?,D,"The correct answer is D. Increased cardiovascular mortality risk.

SGLT2 (Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2) inhibitors are a class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes. They have been shown to have several benefits, including:

* Reducing the risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (Option B)
* Increasing the risk of genital fungal infections, particularly in women (Option A)
* Increasing the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, especially in patients with type 1 diabetes or those who are insulin-deficient (Option C)

However, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to DECREASE the risk of cardiovascular mortality, not increase it. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, which studied the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin, demonstrated a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.

Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.",Success
Which ONE of the following is MOST likely contributing to her sexual inactivity?,B,"The correct answer is A. Sexual dysfunction.

The patient's history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and hemodialysis increases her risk of sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction is a common problem in patients with ESRD, affecting up to 70% of women and 80% of men on dialysis. This is due to various factors, including hormonal changes, anemia, and vascular disease, which can lead to decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and vaginal dryness.

While lack of interest (option B) and physical debility (option C) could also contribute to sexual inactivity, they are less likely to be the primary cause in this patient. The patient's ability to walk several miles each day without difficulty suggests that physical debility is not a significant issue. Additionally, the patient's denial of depressed mood and her continued ability to work part-time suggest that lack of interest is not the primary cause.

The type of vascular access, whether an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or a tunneled central venous access (option D), is unlikely to be the primary contributor to sexual inactivity. AVFs are generally considered the preferred type of vascular access for hemodialysis, and they do not typically affect sexual function.

It's essential to address sexual dysfunction in patients with ESRD, as it can significantly impact their quality of life. A sensitive and open discussion with the patient and her partner can help identify the underlying causes and lead to appropriate interventions.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the BEST initial pharmacologic intervention for maintaining rate control in this woman with atrial ﬁbrillation during dialysis?,C,"The correct answer is D. Digoxin.

In this scenario, the patient is experiencing symptomatic atrial fibrillation during hemodialysis sessions, and her heart rate is not well-controlled. Digoxin is a medication that is commonly used to control ventricular rate in patients with atrial fibrillation, particularly in those with kidney disease. It is also effective in reducing the frequency and severity of atrial fibrillation episodes.

The other options are not the best initial pharmacologic interventions for this patient:

A. Metoprolol is a beta blocker that can be used to control heart rate, but it may not be the best choice in this patient with ESRD, as it can exacerbate kidney disease.

B. Enalapril is an ACE inhibitor that is used to treat hypertension and kidney disease, but it is not typically used to control heart rate in atrial fibrillation.

C. Bisoprolol is a beta blocker that can be used to control heart rate, but it may not be as effective as digoxin in this patient with ESRD and chronic atrial fibrillation.

It's worth noting that the patient's medications, including amlodipine and aspirin, are not likely to be contributing to her atrial fibrillation, and epoetin is used to treat anemia in patients with ESRD.",Success
"Question 5822
Which ONE of the following is a risk factor for post-transplantation malignancy?",C,"The correct answer is C. Use of two or more immunosuppressive agents.

Post-transplantation malignancy is a known complication of solid organ transplantation, and the use of immunosuppressive agents is a significant risk factor. Immunosuppressive therapy is necessary to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ, but it can also increase the risk of malignancy by suppressing the immune system's ability to detect and eliminate cancer cells.

Studies have consistently shown that the use of multiple immunosuppressive agents, particularly those that target different aspects of the immune system, increases the risk of post-transplantation malignancy. This is because the combined use of these agents can lead to a more profound suppression of the immune system, making it easier for cancer cells to grow and spread.

The other options are not correct:

A. Younger age is not a risk factor for post-transplantation malignancy. In fact, older age is a risk factor, as the risk of malignancy increases with age.

B. Female sex is not a risk factor for post-transplantation malignancy. The risk of malignancy is similar between men and women.

D. Black race is not a risk factor for post-transplantation malignancy. The risk of malignancy is similar across different racial and ethnic groups.

It's essential to note that the risk of post-transplantation malignancy can be minimized by using immunosuppressive agents judiciously, monitoring patients closely for signs of malignancy, and promoting healthy lifestyle habits, such as avoiding tobacco and excessive sun exposure.",Success
"At this point, which ONE of the following would you recommend next?",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, I would recommend option A: Measuring PTH-related protein (PTHrP).

Here's my reasoning:

* The patient presents with hypercalcemia (albumin-corrected serum calcium of 15.1 mg/dl) and a suppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 5 pg/ml, which suggests that the hypercalcemia is not due to primary hyperparathyroidism.
* The patient's history of cosmetic injections with polymethylmethacrylate for HIV lipodystrophy 3 months prior to the onset of symptoms raises suspicion for a possible cause-and-effect relationship.
* PTHrP is a protein that can cause hypercalcemia in certain conditions, such as malignancy or granulomatous disorders. In this case, it's possible that the polymethylmethacrylate injections may have triggered a granulomatous reaction, leading to the production of PTHrP and subsequent hypercalcemia.
* Measuring PTHrP would help determine if it's elevated, which would support this hypothesis and guide further management.

The other options are not as relevant at this point:

* Measuring 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (option B) may be useful in evaluating vitamin D metabolism, but it's not directly related to the patient's hypercalcemia and symptoms.
* Measuring serum and urine protein electrophoreses with immunofixation (option C) is typically used to evaluate for multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders, which is not suspected in this case.
* Measuring 25 dihydroxyvitamin D (option D) is a screening test for vitamin D deficiency, which is not the primary concern in this patient's presentation.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely outcome when using a transfusion threshold of hemoglobin less than or equal to 9 g/dl versus a hemoglobin less than or equal to 7 g/dl in this patient?,D,"The correct answer is D. Increased risk for acute lung injury.

The TRICC (Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care) trial, a landmark study published in 1999, compared a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfusing at hemoglobin ≤ 7 g/dl) to a liberal strategy (transfusing at hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dl) in critically ill patients. The study found that the restrictive strategy was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of acute lung injury.

In this scenario, using a transfusion threshold of hemoglobin ≤ 7 g/dl (restrictive strategy) would be expected to decrease the risk of acute lung injury compared to a threshold of hemoglobin ≤ 9 g/dl (liberal strategy).

The other options are not supported by the evidence:

A. Improved survival: The TRICC trial did not show a significant difference in mortality between the two transfusion strategies.

B. Decreased risk of AKI: There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that a restrictive transfusion strategy decreases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI).

C. Decreased duration of mechanical intubation: The duration of mechanical ventilation is influenced by multiple factors, and the transfusion strategy is not a primary determinant.

E. Decreased requirement for vasoactive drugs: There is no evidence to suggest that a restrictive transfusion strategy would decrease the requirement for vasoactive drugs.

It's essential to note that individual patient factors, such as cardiovascular disease, should be considered when making transfusion decisions. However, based on the available evidence, a transfusion threshold of hemoglobin ≤ 7 g/dl is likely to increase the risk of acute lung injury in this patient.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate response by the physician?,D,"The correct answer is D. He should continue taking his medications as prescribed and ensure he is compliant.

The patient's concern is based on a common misconception that taking medications at night can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) substantially. However, the evidence suggests that the timing of blood pressure (BP) medication administration does not have a significant impact on CVD risk reduction.

The MAPEC (Monitorización Ambulatoria de la Presión Arterial y Eventos Cardiovasculares) study, a randomized controlled trial, found that taking BP medications at bedtime rather than in the morning did not result in a significant reduction in CVD events. The study did find that bedtime dosing was associated with better BP control during sleep, but this did not translate to a reduction in CVD events.

The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology do not recommend altering the timing of BP medication administration as a strategy to reduce CVD risk. Instead, they emphasize the importance of adhering to prescribed medication regimens, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and controlling other cardiovascular risk factors.

Therefore, the most appropriate response by the physician is to reassure the patient that he should continue taking his medications as prescribed and focus on ensuring compliance with the regimen.",Success
Which of the following statements is correct?,D,"The correct answer is D. He is at risk for immune complex glomerulonephritis that may or may not be related to his HIV.

Here's why:

* Option A is incorrect because, despite the patient's undetectable viral load, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has been associated with nephrotoxicity, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney disease. Given the patient's new hematuria and proteinuria, it is essential to reassess his antiretroviral therapy and consider alternative options.
* Option B is incorrect because, although HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is a possibility, the patient's presentation with hematuria and proteinuria is not typical of HIVAN, which usually presents with nephrotic-range proteinuria and a more rapid decline in kidney function.
* Option C is incorrect because, while tenofovir disoproxil fumarate can increase the risk of nephrolithiasis, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are more suggestive of a glomerular disease rather than a stone.

Immune complex glomerulonephritis is a possibility in this patient, given his HIV status and the presence of hematuria and proteinuria. However, it is essential to perform a kidney biopsy to determine the underlying cause of his kidney disease, as it may or may not be related to his HIV infection.",Success
What is the optimal decision in regard to the renal replacement therapy for this patient?,C,"The correct answer is C. Begin continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration with standard sodium concentration dialysate and replacement fluid; at the same time continue hypertonic saline infusion to maintain permissive hypernatremia.

Rationale:

* The patient has ESKD and is 3 days post-dialysis, with elevated BUN and creatinine levels, indicating the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT).
* Intermittent hemodialysis (Option A) may not be the best choice in this critically ill patient, as it can cause hemodynamic instability and may not provide adequate solute removal.
* Continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) is a better option, as it provides gentle and continuous solute removal, which can help manage electrolyte abnormalities and azotemia.
* Option B is incorrect because discontinuing hypertonic saline infusion may compromise the patient's cerebral perfusion pressure and worsen their neurological status.
* Option C is the optimal choice because it allows for continuous solute removal while maintaining permissive hypernatremia, which is essential in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage to prevent cerebral edema and maintain cerebral perfusion pressure.
* Option D is incorrect because holding off RRT may lead to further deterioration of the patient's electrolyte and acid-base status, which could worsen their neurological outcome.

It's essential to note that CVVHDF should be initiated with careful monitoring of the patient's electrolyte and acid-base status, as well as their neurological status, to ensure that the treatment is not exacerbating their condition.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements is TRUE about managing potentially contaminated dialysis water supplies in the event of a natural disaster?,A,"The correct answer is none of the above. Here's why:

A. A tanker truck that has been repurposed from hauling vegetable oil is not an acceptable source of water for hemodialysis pretreatment systems. The truck may not have been properly cleaned and sanitized, and there may be residual contaminants from the previous cargo that could affect the quality of the water.

B. Water transported by tanker trucks to dialysis facilities should be chlorinated before the beginning of the haul to prevent bacterial contamination during transportation.

C. Water from a well deeper than 30 meters is not necessarily considered a safe water supply for hemodialysis after a hurricane or flooding. Wells can be contaminated by floodwaters, and the water quality may be compromised. The well should be tested and deemed safe by local authorities before use.

D. During a ""Boil-Water Advisory,"" dialysis water treatment systems that rely on de-ionization units may not be sufficient to ensure water safety. De-ionization units may not remove all contaminants, and additional modifications, such as ultraviolet (UV) light disinfection or reverse osmosis, may be necessary to ensure the water is safe for hemodialysis.

In the event of a natural disaster, it's essential to follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and local authorities to ensure the safety of the dialysis water supply. This may involve testing the water quality, implementing additional treatment steps, and taking other precautions to prevent patient harm.",Success
Which ONE antihypertensive medication would be BEST to add-on to her current regimen?,D,"The correct answer is D. Spironolactone.

The patient is already taking a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), an angiotensin receptor blocker (candesartan), and a diuretic (chlorthalidone), which is a reasonable combination for hypertension management. However, her blood pressure remains uncontrolled.

Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, is a good add-on option in this scenario. It has been shown to be effective in resistant hypertension, particularly in patients with hypertension and normal kidney function (1). Additionally, the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines recommend spironolactone as an add-on therapy for resistant hypertension (2).

Doxazosin (A) is an alpha-blocker, which may not be the best choice as a single add-on medication, especially since the patient is already taking a diuretic. Hydralazine (B) is a vasodilator, which can cause reflex tachycardia and may not be well-tolerated in this patient. Labetalol (C) is a beta-blocker, which may not be the best choice since the patient is not experiencing tachycardia or other symptoms that would warrant beta-blockade.

Which ONE of the following statements is correct regarding the effect of allopurinol among CKD patients who are at risk of kidney disease progression but with normouricemia?,C,"The correct answer is B. Allopurinol lowers uric acid level and slows the rate of GFR decline.

According to current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices, allopurinol has been shown to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with normouricemia (normal uric acid levels). A 2018 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that allopurinol treatment in CKD patients with normouricemia reduced the rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and lowered the risk of kidney disease progression.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) recommend considering allopurinol therapy in CKD patients with normouricemia who are at risk of kidney disease progression, as it may help slow the decline in kidney function.

Option A is incorrect because allopurinol does have an effect on uric acid lowering and has been shown to slow CKD progression. Option C is also incorrect because allopurinol not only lowers uric acid levels but also slows the rate of GFR decline. Option D is incorrect because while allopurinol may slow CKD progression, it has not been shown to directly lower the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).",Success
Which ONE of the following is associated with an increased risk of progressive CKD in this woman?,B,"The correct answer is A. Her low health-related quality of life.

According to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, a low health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is associated with an increased risk of progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient's score of 1.2 SDs below the mean on the Kidney Disease Quality of Life-36 survey indicates a low HRQOL, which is a predictor of poor outcomes in CKD patients.

The other options are not directly associated with an increased risk of progressive CKD in this woman:

B. While a parental history of cardiovascular disease may increase her risk of cardiovascular events, it is not a direct risk factor for progressive CKD.

C. The patient is adherent to a 2.5-g sodium-restricted diet, which is a recommended intervention for CKD patients to slow disease progression. Therefore, her dietary sodium intake is not a risk factor for progressive CKD.

D. Mild nonproliferative retinopathy is a common complication of CKD, but it is not a risk factor for progressive CKD.

It's essential to address the patient's low HRQOL and develop a plan to improve it, as it may impact her overall health outcomes and adherence to CKD management.",Success
"In addition to RAAS blockade, which ONE of the following is the BEST treatment recommendation for this woman?",B,"The correct answer is B. Begin enzyme replacement therapy now.

According to current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with agalsidase-b is recommended for patients with Fabry disease who have evidence of kidney damage, such as proteinuria, even if their serum creatinine level is normal or mildly elevated.

In this case, the patient has a significant amount of daily urinary protein excretion (900 mg), which indicates kidney damage. Additionally, she has other symptoms and signs of Fabry disease, such as acroparesthesias, abdominal pain, diarrhea, verticillata, and angiokeratomas.

The European Fabry Working Group recommends initiating ERT in patients with Fabry disease who have proteinuria (>300 mg/24 hours) or a decline in renal function, regardless of the level of serum creatinine. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics also recommends ERT for patients with Fabry disease who have evidence of kidney damage or other organ involvement.

Delaying ERT until the serum creatinine level exceeds 1.5 mg/dl (Option C) or waiting to see if protein excretion remains above 500 mg per day after 6 months of RAAS inhibition (Option A) may allow further kidney damage to occur. Option D is incorrect because while some patients with Fabry disease may have a favorable renal prognosis without treatment, this patient's proteinuria and other symptoms indicate that she would benefit from ERT.

Therefore, the best treatment recommendation for this woman is to begin enzyme replacement therapy now (Option B).",Success
The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends which of the following approaches to hypertension screening in the general population?,B,"The correct answer is B. Careful office measurement followed by out-of-office measurement if BP is elevated.

According to the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines, the recommended approach to hypertension screening in the general population is to start with careful office measurement of blood pressure. If the initial office measurement indicates elevated blood pressure, it should be followed by out-of-office measurement, such as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or home blood pressure monitoring, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out white-coat hypertension.

In this case, the patient's average blood pressure reading of 136/84 mm Hg is elevated, and further assessment with out-of-office measurement would be appropriate to determine if she truly has hypertension or if the elevated reading is due to the office environment.",Success
"In patients admitted with severe COVID-19 illness and AKI requiring dialysis, which ONE of the following was associated by multivariate analysis with requirement of dialysis at time of discharge from hospital?",A,"Based on current medical literature, the correct answer is:

A. History of CKD

Studies have shown that patients with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are more likely to require long-term dialysis after an episode of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to severe COVID-19 illness.

A 2020 study published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology found that among patients with severe COVID-19 and AKI requiring dialysis, a history of CKD was an independent predictor of requiring dialysis at hospital discharge.

While mechanical ventilation, pressor support, and cardiovascular disease may be associated with worse outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19, they are not specifically linked to the requirement of long-term dialysis in this context.

It's essential to provide empathetic and realistic counseling to the patient's family, explaining that the patient's history of CKD increases the likelihood of requiring long-term dialysis. However, it's also important to emphasize that individual outcomes can vary, and ongoing monitoring and care will help determine the best course of treatment.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell them about the effects of marijuana on CKD incidence and progression?,D,"The correct answer is D. Marijuana use is not associated with CKD incidence or progression.

According to current evidence, there is no conclusive link between marijuana use and the incidence or progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). A 2019 systematic review published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases found that the available literature did not support an association between marijuana use and CKD incidence or progression.

It's essential to note that while marijuana use may not directly impact CKD, it can interact with certain medications, including those used to manage CKD-related comorbidities. Additionally, marijuana use can have other health effects, such as increasing heart rate and blood pressure, which may be relevant for patients with CKD.

In this scenario, you can reassure the patient and his brother that occasional marijuana use is unlikely to worsen his kidney function or accelerate CKD progression. However, it's crucial to emphasize the importance of adhering to his treatment plan and attending regular follow-up appointments to monitor his kidney health.",Success
"With regard to the treatment of FSGS, which of the following is correct?",C,"The correct answer is C. In retrospective studies, up to 30% of adults with steroid-resistant FSGS had a potentially causative genetic mutation identified.

Here's why:

* Option A is incorrect: While rituximab has been used off-label to treat FSGS, there is limited evidence from randomized controlled trials to support its efficacy in this condition.
* Option B is correct, but not the best answer: Up to 60% of patients with FSGS may experience a relapse after initial treatment with corticosteroids. However, this option does not provide new information about the patient's current treatment options.
* Option C is correct: Recent studies have identified genetic mutations in up to 30% of adults with steroid-resistant FSGS. This is important to consider in the patient's treatment plan, as genetic testing may be warranted to identify potential underlying causes of the disease.
* Option D is incorrect: While SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to have renoprotective effects in patients with diabetes, there is no evidence to support their use in the management of secondary FSGS.

As the patient's medical assistant, I would discuss the possibility of genetic testing with the patient, as well as explore other treatment options to further reduce proteinuria and slow disease progression.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell her about her the beneﬁts and risks of bariatric surgery?,B,"The correct answer is B. It reduces the risk of incident CKD and ESRD.

Bariatric surgery has been shown to have several benefits for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including reducing the risk of incident CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Studies have demonstrated that bariatric surgery can lead to significant weight loss, improved glucose control, and reduced blood pressure, all of which can help slow the progression of CKD.

In this patient's case, with a diagnosis of stage G3a:A2 CKD, bariatric surgery may be particularly beneficial in reducing her risk of progressing to ESRD.

Option A is incorrect because bariatric surgery is associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury, particularly in patients with pre-existing CKD.

Option C is incorrect because bariatric surgery has been shown to reduce urinary protein excretion in patients with CKD.

Option D is incorrect because bariatric surgery has been shown to have a positive impact on resolution or reduction of hypertension in many patients.

It's essential to discuss the potential benefits and risks of bariatric surgery with the patient, considering her individual circumstances and medical history.",Success
Which ONE of the following is MOST likely to be associated with a decreased risk of a readmission within 30 days of discharge for this patient?,D,"The correct answer is D. An additional provider visit within one month following discharge.

Research has consistently shown that early follow-up care after hospital discharge is a crucial factor in reducing readmission rates. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that early outpatient follow-up within 7-10 days of discharge was associated with a significant reduction in hospital readmissions within 30 days (1). Another study published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases found that early provider follow-up after hospital discharge was a key factor in reducing readmissions in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (2).

In this scenario, the patient's inability to ambulate (Option A) and his advanced age (Option B) are potential risk factors for readmission, but they are not directly modifiable. The patient's residence in a nursing home (Option C) may provide some support, but it is not a guarantee against readmission.

In contrast, an additional provider visit within one month following discharge (Option D) can help identify and address any potential issues or complications early on, reducing the likelihood of readmission.

Which ONE of the following should you tell the surgeon about the expected beneﬁt of using extended-release dipyridamole plus aspirin after arteriovenous graft placement?,B,"The correct answer is B. Its use will be associated with no clinically meaningful increase in arteriovenous graft patency.

According to the DOPPS (Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study) trial, which evaluated the use of extended-release dipyridamole plus aspirin in patients with ESRD undergoing arteriovenous graft placement, the combination therapy did not demonstrate a clinically significant improvement in graft patency or survival compared to placebo.

The study found that the primary unassisted graft patency at 1 year was similar between the treatment and placebo groups, suggesting that the addition of extended-release dipyridamole plus aspirin did not provide a significant benefit in terms of graft patency.

Therefore, based on the current evidence, it is reasonable to inform the surgeon that the use of extended-release dipyridamole plus aspirin after arteriovenous graft placement is not expected to result in a clinically meaningful increase in graft patency.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in treatment?,A,"The correct answer is A. Subtotal parathyroidectomy.

This patient has severe hyperparathyroidism, as evidenced by the extremely elevated PTH level (1208 pg/ml) and hypercalcemia (10.6-11.2 mg/dl). The parathyroid scintigraphy shows four enlarged glands, indicating parathyroid hyperplasia, which is a common complication in kidney transplant patients.

Given the severity of the hyperparathyroidism and the significant decrease in bone density (Z score of -22.1 and T score of -22.7), surgical intervention is the most appropriate next step. Subtotal parathyroidectomy, which involves removing 3.5 glands, is the recommended surgical approach for parathyroid hyperplasia.

Option B, cinacalcet, is a calcimimetic medication that can help lower PTH levels, but it is not a definitive treatment for parathyroid hyperplasia and may not be effective in this patient with such severely elevated PTH levels.

Option C, paricalcitol, is a vitamin D analog that can help manage secondary hyperparathyroidism, but it is not a treatment for parathyroid hyperplasia.

Option D, denosumab, is a monoclonal antibody that can help manage osteoporosis, but it is not a treatment for hyperparathyroidism or parathyroid hyperplasia.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, surgical parathyroidectomy is recommended for patients with severe hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia, especially those with parathyroid hyperplasia.",Success
Which of the following is the best next step in the assessment of her BP?,D,"The correct answer is D. She should complete a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring to decide whether or not she has hypertension.

According to the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Society of Hypertension (ASH), a single elevated blood pressure reading is not sufficient to diagnose hypertension. The patient's BP reading of 136/82 mmHg is above the normal range, but it's essential to confirm the diagnosis with further evaluation.

Option A is incorrect because a BP of 136/82 mmHg is above the normal range, and further evaluation is necessary to determine if she has hypertension.

Option B is incorrect because a single reading above 130/80 mmHg does not necessarily mean she has hypertension. The diagnosis of hypertension requires multiple readings over time.

Option C is incorrect because while white coat hypertension is a possibility, it's essential to rule out hypertension with further evaluation, such as 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring, before proceeding with the donor evaluation.

The 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring is a recommended diagnostic tool to evaluate BP patterns over time, which can help to diagnose hypertension and assess the patient's BP variability. This test can provide a more accurate picture of the patient's BP and help determine if she is suitable to proceed with the kidney donation evaluation.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell him about PD in the context of his cirrhosis?,A,"The correct answer is C. The MELD score is independently associated with all-cause mortality in patients with cirrhosis treated with PD.

This option is supported by evidence-based practices. The MELD score is a well-established predictor of mortality in patients with end-stage liver disease, including those undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). Studies have shown that the MELD score is independently associated with all-cause mortality in patients with cirrhosis treated with PD (1, 2). This information is important to discuss with the patient, as it may impact his prognosis and treatment decisions.

Option A is incorrect, as there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that PD has a significantly lower mortality rate compared to hemodialysis (HD) in patients with cirrhosis and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (3).

Option B is also incorrect, as there is no evidence to suggest that serum albumin levels are lower in patients with cirrhosis who undergo PD compared to those treated with HD.

Option D is incorrect, as ascites is not an absolute contraindication to PD. While it may present technical challenges and increase the risk of complications, PD can still be performed in patients with ascites, especially those with a high MELD score and limited other treatment options (4).

Which ONE of the following findings is MOST predictive of cognitive decline in this woman?,D,"The correct answer is D. The absence of nocturnal dipping.

Research has shown that the absence of nocturnal dipping, also known as non-dipping status, is a strong predictor of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults (1, 2). Nocturnal dipping refers to the normal decrease in blood pressure that occurs during sleep. In this patient, the ambulatory BP monitoring shows a mean nighttime BP of 136/84 mmHg, which indicates that her blood pressure does not decrease at night, suggesting non-dipping status.

While high blood pressure is a risk factor for cognitive decline, the specific values of systolic or diastolic blood pressure (options B and A) are not as strongly predictive of cognitive decline as the absence of nocturnal dipping. Additionally, dietary sodium intake (option C) is not directly related to cognitive decline in this scenario.

Which of the following is true regarding nocturnal HHD?,C,"The correct answer is C. He may not need to use phosphate binders with nocturnal HD.

Nocturnal home hemodialysis (HHD) is a type of dialysis that is performed at home, typically while the patient is sleeping, for 6-8 hours per night, 3-4 times a week. Studies have shown that nocturnal HHD can improve phosphate control, and some patients may not require phosphate binders. This is because the longer and more frequent dialysis sessions can effectively remove phosphates from the blood.

Option A is incorrect because nocturnal HHD has been shown to improve blood pressure control compared to conventional in-center hemodialysis.

Option B is incorrect because while the Frequent Hemodialysis Network (FHN) trial did show that frequent hemodialysis (including nocturnal HD) was associated with improved outcomes, the trial was not conclusive in demonstrating a mortality benefit.

Option D is incorrect because intensive hemodialysis, such as nocturnal HHD, has been shown to improve left ventricular hypertrophy, not worsen it. This is likely due to the improved blood pressure control and volume management achieved with more frequent and longer dialysis sessions.",Success
Which ONE of the following best describes the observed associations with high concentrations of PTH in univariate and multivariate analyses?,B,"Based on the study, the correct answer is:

D. No increased risk of fracture, increased risk of vascular events, increased risk of all-cause mortality

The study found that high concentrations of PTH were associated with an increased risk of vascular events and all-cause mortality, but not with an increased risk of fracture. This suggests that elevated PTH levels may have a stronger impact on cardiovascular health and overall mortality than on bone health in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).",Success
"When considering his transplant referral and management, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?",B,"The correct answer is C. Referral to a transplant center with extensive prior experience in HIV-positive transplantation.

According to current guidelines and evidence-based practices, kidney transplantation is a viable option for HIV-positive patients with end-stage renal disease, provided they meet certain criteria, including undetectable viral load and no active opportunistic infections. However, it's essential to refer these patients to a transplant center with extensive experience in managing HIV-positive transplant recipients, as they require specialized care and management.

The other options are not the most appropriate management for this patient:

A. While cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both immunosuppressive agents used in transplantation, there is no specific evidence to suggest that one is preferred over the other in HIV-positive patients.

B. Thymoglobulin induction therapy may be used in certain transplant scenarios, but it's not specifically indicated for HIV-positive patients.

D. The use of HIV-positive deceased donors is not contraindicated, and in fact, the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act (HOPE Act) allows for the use of HIV-positive organs in HIV-positive recipients. This can increase the availability of organs for transplantation in this population.

Referral to a transplant center with experience in HIV-positive transplantation is crucial to ensure the patient receives optimal care and management, taking into account the complexities of HIV infection and immunosuppression.",Success
"In considering this case, which of the following statements is most accurate?",B,"The correct answer is B. The recent reduction in insulin dosing may be the precipitant for this clinical presentation.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and medical history suggest that he may be experiencing a euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The presence of acidosis (HCO3- 15 mmol/L), elevated anion gap (calculated anion gap = 21 mmol/L), and mildly elevated lactate level support this diagnosis. Although the patient's blood glucose level is not severely elevated, euglycemic DKA can occur, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking insulin.

The recent reduction in insulin dosing may have contributed to the development of DKA, as it may have led to inadequate insulin coverage and increased glucose production, resulting in ketoacidosis.

Option A is incorrect because metformin is not typically associated with acidosis or ketoacidosis.

Option C is incorrect because a near-normal blood glucose level does not exclude ketoacidosis as a cause of this presentation, especially in the context of euglycemic DKA.

Option D is incorrect because there is no indication for intravenous infusion of isotonic bicarbonate in this case. The patient's acidosis is likely due to ketoacidosis, which requires insulin therapy and fluid management, rather than bicarbonate supplementation.",Success
"Question 2653:
Which ONE of the following statements about antibody induction therapy for kidney transplantation is CORRECT?",D,"The correct answer is D. Induction therapy associates with approximately 50% rejection risk reduction compared with no induction therapy.

Explanation:
Antibody induction therapy is a common practice in kidney transplantation to reduce the risk of acute rejection. Studies have consistently shown that induction therapy with agents such as basiliximab, alemtuzumab, or rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) reduces the risk of acute rejection by approximately 50% compared to no induction therapy (1, 2). This reduction in rejection risk is thought to be due to the depletion or modulation of T-cells, which are key players in the rejection process.

Option A is incorrect because while basiliximab does reduce rejection risk, the reduction is not marked in tacrolimus/mycophenolate/steroid-treated nonsensitized patients.

Option B is incorrect because rituximab is not typically used as an induction agent in kidney transplantation, and its role in reducing rejection risk is not well established.

Option C is incorrect because while alemtuzumab is sometimes used as part of a steroid-free regimen, it is not the most widely used strategy in the United States.

"Question 2471:
Which ONE of the following statements is CORRECT regarding strategies for population based management of hypertension?",B,"The correct answer is B. Home BP tele-monitoring supervised by a health care provider results in higher rates of BP control than usual care.

According to the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC), home blood pressure (BP) monitoring with tele-monitoring and support from a healthcare provider can improve BP control rates. This approach has been shown to be effective in several studies, including a 2018 meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) that found tele-monitored home BP monitoring to be associated with significant reductions in systolic BP compared to usual care.

The other options are incorrect:

A. Self-monitored BP at home can actually improve BP control rates, not worsen them, as it allows patients to take a more active role in their care and make lifestyle changes or medication adjustments as needed.

C. While self-treatment titration based on home BP readings may be suitable for some patients, it is not recommended for more than 75% of hypertensive patients, as it requires careful patient selection and close monitoring to ensure safety and efficacy.

D. Self-treatment titration based on home BP readings can be safe for uncomplicated hypertensive patients, but it is not recommended for patients with comorbid conditions, who may require more complex care and closer monitoring.

E. Financial incentives to physicians may actually result in measurable improvements in BP control rates, as they can motivate healthcare providers to prioritize BP control and implement evidence-based strategies to achieve better outcomes.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the BEST course of treatment for this patient?,D,"The correct answer is C. Sofosbuvir plus simeprevir.

Here's why:

The patient has hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, cryoglobulinemia, and cryoglobulinemic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (GN). The primary goal is to treat the underlying HCV infection, which is likely contributing to the cryoglobulinemia and kidney disease.

Sofosbuvir plus simeprevir is a direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimen that is effective against HCV genotype 1, which is the most common genotype associated with cryoglobulinemia. This regimen has been shown to improve kidney function and reduce proteinuria in patients with HCV-related kidney disease.

Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody, is often used to treat cryoglobulinemia, but it is not a substitute for antiviral therapy in this case. Plasma exchange may be used in severe cases of cryoglobulinemia, but it is not the primary treatment for HCV infection. Cyclophosphamide is an immunosuppressive agent that may be used in some cases of glomerulonephritis, but it is not necessary in this scenario.

The addition of rituximab to the DAA regimen (option D) is not supported by current evidence and may increase the risk of adverse effects.

Therefore, the best course of treatment for this patient is to start with a DAA regimen, specifically sofosbuvir plus simeprevir, to target the underlying HCV infection.",Success
"Question 2529:
In patients with IgA nephropathy with eGFRs.60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and persistent proteinuria (0.75 g/d) after a 3- to 6-month trial of angiotensin blockade, which ONE of the following has been consistently shown to reduce protein excretion over the short term (e.g., 2 years) in randomized clinical trials?",A,"The correct answer is A. Oral glucocorticoids.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for Glomerulonephritis, in patients with IgA nephropathy and persistent proteinuria (>0.75 g/d) despite optimal supportive care, including angiotensin blockade, a 6-month course of oral glucocorticoids is recommended to reduce protein excretion over the short term (e.g., 2 years).

Randomized clinical trials have consistently shown that oral glucocorticoids reduce protein excretion in patients with IgA nephropathy. A 2015 Cochrane review found that glucocorticoids significantly reduced proteinuria in patients with IgA nephropathy. Additionally, the STOP-IgAN trial published in 2015 demonstrated that a 6-month course of glucocorticoids reduced proteinuria and slowed disease progression in patients with IgA nephropathy.

The other options have not been consistently shown to reduce protein excretion in randomized clinical trials. While mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, and azathioprine are immunosuppressive agents that may be used in certain cases of IgA nephropathy, the evidence for their efficacy in reducing protein excretion is limited. Omega-3 fatty acids may have some beneficial effects on proteinuria, but the evidence is not as strong as it is for glucocorticoids.",Success
What is the MOST likely explanation for the ﬁnding on the immunoﬂuorescence?,C,"Based on the patient's presentation and the immunoﬂuorescence (IF) findings, the most likely explanation for the fine punctate staining for IgG is:

B. Presence of anti-PLA2R antibody

The patient's presentation with proteinuria (6.2 g over 24 hours) and low serum albumin (2.3 g/dl) suggests a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. The normal light microscopy on kidney biopsy rules out significant glomerular damage or inflammation. The fine punctate staining for IgG on IF is consistent with a diagnosis of membranous nephropathy, which is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome.

Anti-PLA2R (phospholipase A2 receptor) antibody is a specific autoantibody associated with primary membranous nephropathy. It is typically detected by IF as a fine granular or punctate pattern along the glomerular capillary walls. The presence of this antibody supports a diagnosis of primary membranous nephropathy, which is the most likely explanation for the patient's presentation.

The other options are less likely:

A. Nonspecific entrapment of IgG in the glomeruli is possible, but the fine punctate pattern on IF suggests a more specific antibody-mediated process.

C. Antinephrin antibody is not a recognized autoantibody associated with membranous nephropathy or nephrotic syndrome.

D. Anti-NELL-1 antibody is not a known autoantibody associated with kidney disease or nephrotic syndrome.

Note: The EM results are pending, but based on the IF findings, anti-PLA2R antibody is the most likely explanation.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the next BEST serologic study to help deﬁne the etiology of her disease?,E,"The correct answer is C. C3 nephritic factor.

The patient's presentation with hematuria, proteinuria, impaired kidney function, and low serum C3 level suggests a diagnosis of dense deposit disease, a rare form of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). The next step is to determine the etiology of the disease.

C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF) is an autoantibody that stabilizes the alternative pathway C3 convertase, leading to excessive C3 consumption and low serum C3 levels. It is a common cause of MPGN and dense deposit disease. Measuring C3NeF levels can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis of dense deposit disease or MPGN:

A. Antistreptolysin O titers are used to diagnose post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which is not consistent with the patient's biopsy findings.

B. Soluble C5b-9 levels may be elevated in various inflammatory conditions, but they are not specific to dense deposit disease or MPGN.

D. Factor H levels may be low in some cases of MPGN, but it is not a primary diagnostic test for dense deposit disease.

E. Serum immunofixation and free light-chain assays are used to diagnose monoclonal gammopathies, such as multiple myeloma, which is not suspected in this case based on the patient's presentation and biopsy findings.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the best advice for this woman?,B,"The correct answer is B. The woman should understand that aspirin may not be effective for preeclampsia prevention in women with chronic hypertension, but if prescribed, it should be started before 16 weeks' gestation.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines, aspirin prophylaxis is recommended for women at high risk of preeclampsia, including those with a history of preeclampsia, multifetal gestation, chronic hypertension, and renal disease. However, the evidence for aspirin prophylaxis in women with chronic hypertension is limited, and its effectiveness in this population is unclear.

In this case, the woman has a history of chronic hypertension, but she did not experience preeclampsia in her first pregnancy. Despite this, she is still at risk for preeclampsia in this pregnancy. If aspirin is prescribed, it should be started before 16 weeks' gestation, as this is the recommended timing for maximum benefit.

Option A is incorrect because the recommended dose of aspirin for preeclampsia prevention is 81 mg/day, not 150 mg/day. Option C is incorrect because the woman's history of chronic hypertension still puts her at risk for preeclampsia, even though she did not experience it in her first pregnancy. Option D is incorrect because aspirin is associated with an increased risk of bleeding in pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell her about FGF23?,C,"The correct answer is C. Elevated FGF23 serum levels in ESRD are associated with an increased risk of cardio-vascular events, infections, and mortality.

Fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) is a hormone produced by osteocytes that plays a crucial role in regulating phosphate and vitamin D metabolism. In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), FGF23 levels are often elevated due to the kidneys' inability to excrete phosphate.

Elevated FGF23 levels in ESRD have been linked to various adverse outcomes, including cardiovascular events, infections, and mortality. This is because FGF23 promotes left ventricular hypertrophy, vascular calcification, and inflammation, which can contribute to cardiovascular disease. Additionally, FGF23 has been shown to impair immune function, making patients more susceptible to infections.

The other options are incorrect:

A. Elevated FGF23 levels in ESRD do not consistently suppress serum PTH levels. In fact, FGF23 can stimulate PTH production, which can worsen secondary hyperparathyroidism.

B. FGF23 serum levels do not fall as serum PTH levels rise in ESRD. Instead, both FGF23 and PTH levels are often elevated in ESRD patients, contributing to abnormalities in bone and mineral metabolism.

D. FGF23 does not increase 1-α hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Instead, FGF23 inhibits 1-α hydroxylation, leading to decreased active vitamin D levels and further exacerbating secondary hyperparathyroidism.

It's essential to educate the patient about the role of FGF23 in ESRD and its implications for her bone and mineral metabolism, as well as her overall health.",Success
What would you predict as the expected trend and values for pertinent laboratory data shown in the next series of choices?,D,"The correct answer is B. Plasma K+ ↑, Plasma HCO3- ↑, Urine pH ↔, Fractional excretion of [HCO3-] 15%.

Here's the explanation:

1. Plasma K+: The patient is receiving IV hypotonic saline with sodium bicarbonate, which will help correct the hypokalemia. As potassium levels tend to increase when bicarbonate levels increase, the plasma potassium level is expected to rise.
2. Plasma HCO3-: The administration of sodium bicarbonate will increase the plasma bicarbonate levels, which will help correct the metabolic acidosis indicated by the initial low bicarbonate level (15 mEq/L).
3. Urine pH: The urine pH is initially 6, which is slightly acidic. With the administration of sodium bicarbonate, the urine pH might not change significantly, as the kidneys will try to maintain acid-base homeostasis.
4. Fractional excretion of HCO3-: A fractional excretion of HCO3- of 15% is consistent with a proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA), which is a possible diagnosis in this patient given the hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis, and normal anion gap. The patient's history of taking emtricitabine and tenofovir, which can cause RTA, supports this diagnosis.

The other options do not accurately reflect the expected trends and values:

A. Plasma K+ would be expected to increase, not decrease, with sodium bicarbonate administration. Fractional excretion of HCO3- of 2% is too low for a proximal RTA.

C. Plasma HCO3- would be expected to increase, not decrease, with sodium bicarbonate administration. Urine pH would not be expected to decrease.

D. Fractional excretion of HCO3- of 15% is consistent with proximal RTA, but the other values do not match the expected trends.",Success
"Does potassium have any eﬀect on BP?”
Which of the following is likely to be true regarding potassium intake and BP?",B,"The correct answer is B. Hypertension correlates better with the dietary sodium/potassium ratio than with sodium intake alone.

Potassium has a beneficial effect on blood pressure (BP). A diet rich in potassium can help lower BP, and this is especially important for individuals with hypertension and kidney disease. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which is recommended for patients with hypertension, emphasizes increasing potassium intake.

Research has shown that the balance between sodium and potassium in the diet is more important than sodium intake alone in terms of its impact on BP. A higher dietary sodium/potassium ratio is associated with higher BP, while a lower ratio is associated with lower BP. This is because potassium helps to counterbalance the effects of sodium on BP.

In contrast, options A, C, and D are not accurate statements. While potassium restriction may have some effects on sodium handling in the kidneys, the evidence suggests that adequate potassium intake is beneficial for BP control, and restricting potassium is not recommended for kidney patients. In fact, the National Kidney Foundation recommends a potassium intake of 4,700 mg/day for patients with kidney disease.",Success
"Compared with induction therapy with an IL-2 receptor antagonist, which ONE of the following is the MOST likely clinical outcome of using rabbit antithymocyte globulin for induction therapy?",A,"The correct answer is A. A lower incidence of acute rejection.

Rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) is a polyclonal antibody that targets multiple epitopes on T-cells, leading to T-cell depletion and immunosuppression. Compared to IL-2 receptor antagonists, which specifically target the IL-2 receptor on activated T-cells, rATG has been shown to be more effective in reducing the incidence of acute rejection in kidney transplant recipients.

Studies have consistently demonstrated that rATG induction therapy is associated with a lower incidence of acute rejection compared to IL-2 receptor antagonists. For example, a meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Transplantation found that rATG induction therapy reduced the incidence of acute rejection by 34% compared to IL-2 receptor antagonists.

While rATG may have some benefits in terms of graft survival and patient survival, the evidence is not as strong as it is for reducing acute rejection. Additionally, rATG has been associated with an increased risk of malignancy, particularly post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), due to its potent immunosuppressive effects.

Therefore, the most likely clinical outcome of using rATG for induction therapy in this patient is a lower incidence of acute rejection.",Success
"In addition to the patient’s immunosuppressive medications, which ONE of the following fac-tors is associated with an increased risk for the development of diabetes mellitus in the year after transplantation?",A,"The correct answer is A. Hypomagnesemia.

According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the International Society of Nephrology (ISN), hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels) is a risk factor for the development of post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM). Magnesium plays a crucial role in insulin secretion and glucose metabolism, and hypomagnesemia can contribute to insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance.

In this patient, the magnesium level is 1.0 mg/dl, which is below the normal range (1.8-3.0 mg/dl), indicating hypomagnesemia.

The other options are not directly associated with an increased risk of PTDM:

B. Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) is a common electrolyte imbalance in patients with ESRD, but it is not a specific risk factor for PTDM.

C. Hypercalcemia (high calcium levels) is not typically associated with an increased risk of PTDM.

D. Hyperphosphatemia (high phosphorus levels) is a common complication of ESRD, but it is not a direct risk factor for PTDM.

It's essential to note that other factors, such as corticosteroid use, obesity, and family history, are also associated with an increased risk of PTDM in transplant patients.",Success
"Which ONE of the following is the BEST option for KRT initiation for this man, considering the most recent 2019 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes “Controversies in AKI” Conference Report suggestions?",A,"The correct answer is C. Prolonged intermittent kidney replacement therapy (PIKRT) (8 hours/day).

According to the 2019 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes ""Controversies in AKI"" Conference Report, PIKRT is recommended as the preferred modality for KRT initiation in hemodynamically unstable patients with AKI, such as this patient. PIKRT provides a balance between the benefits of continuous therapy and the convenience of intermittent therapy, allowing for more frequent and longer sessions than traditional IHD.

The report suggests that PIKRT may be beneficial in patients who require ongoing cardiovascular support, as it can help to maintain hemodynamic stability while providing adequate solute clearance. In this case, the patient's hemodynamic instability and requirement for inotropic support make PIKRT a more suitable option.

CKRT (Option A) may not be necessary for this patient, as they do not have severe metabolic acidosis or electrolyte imbalance that would require continuous therapy. IHD (Option B) may not provide adequate solute clearance, especially in a hemodynamically unstable patient. Peritoneal dialysis (Option D) may not be the best option in this patient, as it may not provide adequate solute clearance, and the patient's postoperative status may increase the risk of complications.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements should you tell him regarding the expected outcomes of receiving an HCV-positive kidney and management of HCV infection?,A,"The correct answer is A. Consent to receive an HCV-positive kidney may dramatically reduce his waiting time.

Here's why:

* The patient is HCV treatment naive, and his high viral load suggests that he is at risk of transmitting HCV to a new kidney. However, receiving an HCV-positive kidney would not change his HCV status, and he would still be eligible for HCV treatment after transplantation.
* Studies have shown that using HCV-positive kidneys for transplantation in HCV-infected patients can significantly reduce waiting times and improve access to transplantation (1, 2).
* There is no evidence to suggest that receiving an HCV-positive kidney would affect allograft survival (Option B). In fact, some studies have shown similar or even better outcomes with HCV-positive kidneys (3).
* Option C is incorrect because the genotype of the HCV virus in the donor kidney is not a contraindication to transplantation. The patient's genotype 1 HCV infection can still be treated with direct-acting antiviral agents after transplantation.
* Option D is also incorrect because direct-acting antiviral agents are not contraindicated in transplant recipients receiving calcineurin inhibitors. In fact, these agents have been used successfully in transplant recipients to treat HCV infection (4).

What is the preferred resuscitative ﬂuid based on recent studies?,C,"Based on recent studies, the correct answer is D. Lactated Ringer's.

In septic shock, early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) is crucial, and fluid resuscitation is a critical component. The preferred resuscitative fluid in this scenario is a balanced crystalloid solution, such as Lactated Ringer's. This is supported by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines (2020) and the National Institute of Health's (NIH) Sepsis Syndrome clinical trials.

Lactated Ringer's has a more physiological pH and electrolyte composition compared to 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline), which can help reduce the risk of acid-base disturbances and hyperchloremia. Additionally, Lactated Ringer's may help reduce the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) compared to normal saline.

Option A is not a suitable choice, as 5% dextrose in water with sodium bicarbonate is not a recommended resuscitative fluid in septic shock. Options B and C, 0.9% sodium chloride and 0.45% sodium chloride, respectively, are not the preferred choices due to the potential risks mentioned above.

It's essential to note that the patient's laboratory results indicate metabolic acidosis, which should be addressed during resuscitation. However, the primary focus should be on administering a balanced crystalloid solution, such as Lactated Ringer's, to help restore perfusion and oxygenation to vital organs.",Success
"In addition to continued ﬂuid restriction, which ONE of the following is the BEST initial treatment for this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Furosemide at 40 mg/d plus sodium chloride tablets at 1 g three times daily.

The patient's laboratory results and physical examination suggest syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion, which is a common paraneoplastic syndrome associated with non-small cell lung cancer. The patient's hyponatremia is asymptomatic, and the goal of treatment is to correct the sodium level gradually to avoid complications.

Continued fluid restriction alone is unlikely to correct the hyponatremia, and further decreasing water intake may not be effective or safe. 3% saline infusion (option C) is typically reserved for severe, symptomatic hyponatremia, which is not the case here.

The best initial treatment is to increase sodium intake and promote sodium excretion. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, will help increase sodium excretion, and sodium chloride tablets will provide supplemental sodium. This combination is likely to correct the hyponatremia gradually and safely.

It's essential to monitor the patient's sodium levels closely and adjust the treatment as needed to avoid overcorrection, which can lead to complications such as central pontine myelinolysis.",Success
Changing his dialysate [Ca] to 2.75 would do which of the following?,C,"The correct answer is C. Decrease frequency of episodes of intradialytic hypotension.

Rationale:

In patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis, hypocalcemia can contribute to intradialytic hypotension. The patient's current dialysate calcium concentration is 2.5 mEq/L, which may be too low to maintain a stable calcium level during dialysis. Increasing the dialysate calcium concentration to 2.75 mEq/L can help to:

1. Increase the serum calcium level, which may help to reduce the frequency of intradialytic hypotension episodes.
2. Improve cardiovascular stability during dialysis.

Option A is incorrect because increasing the dialysate calcium concentration is likely to decrease parathyroid hormone levels, not increase them. Elevated parathyroid hormone levels are often seen in patients with ESKD and are associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Option B is incorrect because increasing the dialysate calcium concentration can increase the total and ionized calcium levels in the blood.

Option D is incorrect because changing the dialysate calcium concentration can have an effect on laboratory values (e.g., serum calcium levels) and dialysis stability (e.g., reducing intradialytic hypotension episodes).",Success
"Based on recent studies and KDIGO guidelines, which of the following would be expected to improve her long-term outcome?",B,"Based on recent studies and KDIGO guidelines, the correct answer is B. Review the causes of her episodes of peritonitis to reduce risk of recurrence.

Here's why:

* Option A: While statins are important for cardiovascular risk reduction, there is no clear evidence that increasing the dose would improve her long-term outcome specifically in the context of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and her current lipid profile.
* Option C: The KDIGO guidelines recommend a target blood pressure of <140/90 mmHg for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), not <130/80 mmHg. Additionally, her current blood pressure is already well-controlled.
* Option D: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors like lisinopril are actually recommended in patients with CKD and proteinuria, as they can help slow the progression of kidney disease. Stopping the ACE inhibitor is not likely to improve her residual renal function (RRF).

Peritonitis is a serious complication of PD, and recurrent episodes can lead to technique failure, hospitalization, and increased mortality. Identifying and addressing the causes of her previous episodes of peritonitis, such as inadequate catheter care, exit site infections, or constipation, can help reduce the risk of recurrence and improve her long-term outcome.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell him about his ﬁndings?,E,"The correct answer is D. Proteinuria after kidney transplantation increases the risk of graft failure but not death.

The patient's biopsy result showing recurrent FSGS is a significant finding, and it's essential to discuss the prognosis with him. According to current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices, proteinuria after kidney transplantation is a risk factor for graft failure, but it does not directly impact mortality.

A study published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases found that proteinuria is a strong predictor of graft loss, but it does not affect patient survival (1). This is because proteinuria is often a sign of underlying graft dysfunction, which can lead to graft failure if left unmanaged.

The other options are not accurate or relevant to the patient's prognosis:

A. While younger age at the time of transplantation may be associated with better overall outcomes, it is not specifically related to the risk of recurrent FSGS.

B. The statement is incorrect; recurrent glomerular disease does affect allograft survival, but the exact rate of death-censored graft survival at 5 years is not 10%.

C. Subnephrotic-range proteinuria (less than 3.5 g/day) may not have a significant impact on allograft survival, but the patient's urine protein-to-creatinine ratio of 1500 mg/g indicates nephrotic-range proteinuria, which is a more severe condition.

E. The type of donor (living related or deceased) does not affect the likelihood of recurrent disease development.

It's essential to empathetically explain the patient's prognosis, emphasizing the importance of close monitoring and management of his proteinuria to minimize the risk of graft failure.

Which ONE of the following strategies is MOST likely to provide the quickest transition away from catheter-based HD?,C,"The correct answer is C. Placement of an early cannulation arterio-venous graft.

This patient has had recurrent bacteremia and catheter dysfunction, and previous attempts at arteriovenous fistula creation failed due to nonmaturation. Given the patent central veins and absence of suitable peripheral veins for fistula creation, an early cannulation arteriovenous graft is the most likely option to provide a quick transition away from catheter-based HD.

Early cannulation arteriovenous grafts are designed to be cannulated within 24-48 hours of placement, allowing for a rapid transition to graft-based HD. This option is particularly suitable for patients who have exhausted other access options, as in this case.

In contrast, options A and B may not provide a quick transition away from catheter-based HD, as they may require additional procedures or waiting periods before they can be used for HD. Option D, placement of an arteriovenous fistula with sirolimus wrap, is not a viable option given the patient's previous failed attempts at fistula creation.

It's worth noting that the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines recommend arteriovenous grafts as a secondary option for HD access, and early cannulation grafts are a type of arteriovenous graft that can be used in patients who require urgent access.",Success
Which one of the following is the most likely causal agent of her altered mental status?,B,"The correct answer is B. Baclofen.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to baclofen toxicity. Baclofen, a muscle relaxant, can cause confusion, disorientation, and altered mental status, especially in elderly patients. The patient's recent initiation of baclofen 10 mg daily for back pain is a strong temporal association with her current symptoms. Additionally, the patient's lack of fever, chills, or sick contacts, and the unrevealing blood work and CT of the head, make baclofen toxicity a more plausible explanation for her altered mental status.

Gabapentin (Option A) is unlikely to be the cause, as the patient has been on a stable low dose for a long time, and her neuropathy has been well-controlled. Eliquis (Option C) is an anticoagulant and not typically associated with altered mental status. Losartan (Option D) is an antihypertensive medication, and while it can cause dizziness or lightheadedness, it is not typically associated with altered mental status.

It's essential to consider the patient's medication list, medical history, and recent changes in her treatment regimen when evaluating her symptoms. In this case, the recent introduction of baclofen is the most likely culprit behind her altered mental status.",Success
Which ONE of the following infection control gaps has frequently been associated with outbreaks of hepatitis C virus infection in hemodialysis units?,B,"The correct answer is B. Failure of personnel to change gloves and perform hand hygiene when moving between patients, between patients and potentially contaminated surfaces, and between machines.

This option is supported by evidence-based practices and current medical guidelines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) emphasize the importance of proper hand hygiene and glove use in hemodialysis units to prevent the transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and other bloodborne pathogens.

The CDC recommends that healthcare personnel wash their hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer before and after caring for each patient, and after touching potentially contaminated surfaces or equipment. Additionally, gloves should be changed and hands washed or sanitized when moving between patients, and when touching potentially contaminated surfaces or equipment.

The other options are not directly associated with outbreaks of HCV infection in hemodialysis units:

A. While dedicating a room, machine, and equipment to HCV-positive patients may be a good practice, it is not a critical infection control gap associated with HCV outbreaks.

C. Poor compliance with gown use when caring for patients with open skin wounds is important for preventing transmission of other pathogens, but it is not specifically associated with HCV outbreaks in hemodialysis units.

D. Failure to adequately reprocess reusable dialyzers is a critical infection control gap, but it is more closely associated with outbreaks of other infections, such as bacterial infections, rather than HCV.",Success
Which ONE of the following would you predict with regard to the difference in GFR as predicted by the Schwartz formula compared with the CKD-EPI formula in this patient?,B,"The correct answer is C. The calculated GFR is 30% higher using the Schwartz formula.

The Schwartz formula is used to estimate GFR in children and adolescents, whereas the CKD-EPI formula is used for adults. The Schwartz formula takes into account the patient's height and serum creatinine level, and is known to overestimate GFR in adolescents, particularly in those with CKD.

In this case, the patient is 17 years old, which is still considered an adolescent. The Schwartz formula would likely overestimate her GFR compared to the CKD-EPI formula, which is more accurate for adults.

Studies have shown that the Schwartz formula can overestimate GFR by up to 30% in adolescents with CKD, which is consistent with option C. Therefore, it is predicted that the calculated GFR would be 30% higher using the Schwartz formula compared to the CKD-EPI formula in this patient.",Success
"Question 2573:
Which ONE of the following statements regarding the effects of hypomagnesemia in pa-tients receiving chronic hemodialysis therapy is CORRECT?",C,"The correct answer is B. Hypomagnesemia but not hypermagnesemia is associated with an increased risk of premature mortality.

According to the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, hypomagnesemia (low magnesium levels) is associated with an increased risk of premature mortality in patients receiving chronic hemodialysis therapy. This is because magnesium plays a crucial role in maintaining cardiovascular health, and low levels have been linked to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

On the other hand, hypermagnesemia (high magnesium levels) is not typically associated with an increased risk of premature mortality in dialysis patients. In fact, hypermagnesemia is often seen as a benign condition in this population, as the kidneys are unable to excrete excess magnesium effectively.

While supplementation with magnesium may be beneficial in certain situations, there is no conclusive evidence to support the claim that it reduces the risk of premature mortality in dialysis patients. Therefore, option D is not correct.

Option A is incorrect because hypomagnesemia, not hypermagnesemia, is associated with an increased risk of premature mortality. Option C is also incorrect because only hypomagnesemia, not both hypomagnesemia and hypermagnesemia, is linked to an increased risk of premature mortality.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely cause of this patient's hypophosphatemia?,D,"The correct answer is D. Acetazolamide.

The patient's laboratory results show hypophosphatemia (phosphorus level of 0.6 mg/dl), which is likely caused by the recent initiation of acetazolamide therapy for glaucoma. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that can increase urinary excretion of phosphorus, leading to hypophosphatemia. The fractional excretion of phosphorus is 25%, which is elevated, supporting this diagnosis.

The other options are unlikely causes of hypophosphatemia in this patient:

A. Oncogenic osteomalacia is a rare condition caused by tumors that produce fibroblast growth factor 23, leading to phosphaturia. There is no evidence of a tumor in this patient.

B. Primary hyperparathyroidism would typically cause hypercalcemia, not hypophosphatemia.

C. Secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by vitamin D deficiency would typically cause elevated parathyroid hormone levels, which are not mentioned in the patient's laboratory results.

E. Acute respiratory alkalosis can cause a mild decrease in phosphorus levels, but it is unlikely to cause a level as low as 0.6 mg/dl.

It's essential to recognize the potential side effects of medications, especially in elderly patients, to provide timely and effective treatment. In this case, the patient's hypophosphatemia is likely a medication-related adverse effect that needs to be addressed.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell the audience?,B,"The correct answer is B. Disability-adjusted life years attributed to CKD have increased in the United States, whereas disability-adjusted life years for cardiovascular disease and cancer have decreased.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Kidney Foundation, the burden of kidney disease is significant and growing in the United States. While cardiovascular disease and cancer have seen a decline in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), CKD has shown an increase in DALYs over the past decade. This highlights the need for increased awareness, prevention, and management of CKD.

Option A is incorrect because the prevalence of CKD has actually increased over the past decade. Option C is also incorrect because while deaths due to CKD have increased worldwide, they have also increased in the United States. Option D is an underestimate, as approximately 15% of the US population has stage 1-5 CKD.",Success
"Question 2802:
For patients ESRD due to IgA Nephropathy, which ONE of the following is MOST likely to unfavorably affect the risk of recurrence of the disease in a renal allograft?",B,"The correct answer is D. Elevated IgA serum levels at the time of transplantation.

IgA Nephropathy is a chronic kidney disease characterized by the deposition of IgA in the glomeruli, leading to inflammation and scarring. Recurrence of IgA Nephropathy in a renal allograft is a significant concern in patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) due to IgA Nephropathy.

Elevated IgA serum levels at the time of transplantation have been identified as a risk factor for recurrence of IgA Nephropathy in the transplanted kidney. This is because high IgA levels can lead to continued deposition of IgA in the glomeruli, promoting inflammation and scarring.

The other options are not directly related to the risk of recurrence of IgA Nephropathy in a renal allograft:

A. A posttransplantation regimen consisting of tacrolimus, MMF, and low-dose corticosteroids is a common immunosuppressive regimen used to prevent rejection, but it does not specifically affect the risk of recurrence of IgA Nephropathy.

B. Early corticosteroid withdrawal may be associated with a higher risk of rejection, but it is not a specific risk factor for recurrence of IgA Nephropathy.

C. The Oxford-MEST-C score is a classification system used to predict the risk of progression of IgA Nephropathy in native kidneys, but it does not directly affect the risk of recurrence in a renal allograft.

Therefore, option D is the most likely to unfavorably affect the risk of recurrence of IgA Nephropathy in a renal allograft.",Success
What strategy has been suggested by the PrevAKI randomized controlled trial to prevent AKI in this setting and be cost effective?,B,"The correct answer is C. Develop smart order sets with automatic preoperative and postoperative hydration with intravenous 0.9% saline solution.

The PrevAKI randomized controlled trial demonstrated that a perioperative hydration strategy using intravenous 0.9% saline solution can reduce the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery. This approach is cost-effective and has been shown to decrease the incidence of AKI, which in turn can lead to shorter hospital length of stay, fewer complications, and improved mortality.

The other options are not supported by the PrevAKI trial:

A. While E-alerts can be useful in identifying high-risk patients, they may not directly impact AKI prevention.

B. The KDIGO AKI bundle is a set of guidelines for AKI diagnosis and management, but it does not specifically address prevention strategies. TIMP-2 • IGFBP7 is a biomarker for AKI, but its use is not directly related to prevention.

D. Educating surgeons about the nephrotoxicity of loop diuretics is important, but it may not have a direct impact on preventing AKI in the perioperative setting.

By implementing smart order sets with automatic preoperative and postoperative hydration with intravenous 0.9% saline solution, you can take a proactive and evidence-based approach to reducing the risk of AKI in cardiac surgery patients, which can lead to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the BEST explanation of the positive hepatitis B surface antigen serologic result?,D,"The correct answer is D. Recent exposure to hepatitis B vaccine.

Here's why:

* The patient had no prior history of hepatitis B, and previous serologic studies 3 months ago were all negative, ruling out prior infection (option B).
* The patient's liver chemistries are normal, and there is no evidence of acute hepatitis B infection (option C).
* The patient received the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine 5 days ago, which can cause a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) result due to the presence of vaccine-derived antigen in the bloodstream. This is a known phenomenon, especially in the first few weeks after vaccination.
* Acquired immunity from vaccination against hepatitis B virus (option A) would be indicated by the presence of hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), which is currently negative in this patient.

It's essential to consider the timing of the vaccination and the patient's serologic results to arrive at the correct explanation. In this case, the recent exposure to the hepatitis B vaccine is the most likely explanation for the positive HBsAg result.",Success
Which ONE of the following modiﬁcations of maintenance immunosuppression is the MOST appropriate treatment option for this patient?,D,"The correct answer is D. Discontinue mycophenolate, start everolimus.

The patient is experiencing persistent neutropenia, which is a common side effect of mycophenolate mofetil. Despite reducing the dose of mycophenolate mofetil, the patient still requires weekly filgrastim injections. Everolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative to mycophenolate mofetil in kidney transplant patients, particularly in those with neutropenia. Everolimus has a more favorable hematological profile compared to mycophenolate mofetil and can help resolve neutropenia.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Belatacept is a costimulation blocker that is typically used in combination with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids. It is not a suitable replacement for tacrolimus, and its use would not address the patient's neutropenia.

B. Azathioprine is an older immunosuppressive agent that is not commonly used in kidney transplantation due to its toxicity profile and limited efficacy compared to newer agents like mycophenolate mofetil and everolimus.

C. Everolimus is a more suitable alternative to mycophenolate mofetil, but discontinuing tacrolimus and starting everolimus would not address the patient's neutropenia and may lead to inadequate immunosuppression.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the next MOST appropriate step in this patient’s management?,C,"The correct answer is A. Start low-dose ramipril.

The patient has increased albuminuria (33 mg/g) and a history of type 2 diabetes, which puts him at risk for diabetic nephropathy. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that patients with diabetes and albuminuria be treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to reduce the progression of kidney disease. Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor that has been shown to reduce albuminuria and slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with diabetes.

Option B, checking the urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, may be useful in further evaluating the patient's proteinuria, but it is not the next most appropriate step in management.

Option C, measuring or estimating 24-hour creatinine excretion rate, is not necessary at this point, as the patient's eGFR is already known.

Option D, reducing protein intake to 0.8 g/kg, may be a useful adjunctive therapy, but it is not the primary treatment for this patient's albuminuria.

Option E, starting metformin therapy, is not indicated, as the patient's hemoglobin A1c is already well-controlled at 5.7%.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely cause of this man's hypophosphatemia?,A,"The correct answer is A. The release of a phosphaturic factor from the liver.

This patient's hypophosphatemia is likely caused by the release of a phosphaturic factor from the liver, which is a common complication of hepatic surgery. The liver is a major source of phosphate, and surgical manipulation can lead to the release of phosphaturic factors, such as fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which increase phosphate excretion in the urine.

The fractional excretion of phosphorus (FEP) is 18%, which suggests that the kidneys are excreting excessive amounts of phosphate, supporting the diagnosis. The patient's normal pre-operative phosphate level and lack of other underlying conditions make options B, C, D, and E less likely.

It's worth noting that the patient's nasogastric suction and possible malnutrition may also contribute to the hypophosphatemia, but the primary cause is likely the release of phosphaturic factors from the liver.",Success
"Which ONE of the following BEST describes the criteria for establishing a presumptive diagnosis of primary FSGS in a patient without evidence of an adverse drug reaction, cancer, or chronic viral infection?",C,"The correct answer is A. A segmental glomerulosclerotic lesion in at least one glomerulus in a biopsy specimen examined by light microscopy.

According to the current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices, the diagnosis of primary Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is based on the presence of segmental glomerulosclerotic lesions in at least one glomerulus on light microscopy, in the absence of other underlying causes such as adverse drug reactions, cancer, or chronic viral infections.

The other options are not required for establishing a presumptive diagnosis of primary FSGS:

* Option B: IgM deposition by immunofluorescence microscopy may be seen in FSGS, but it is not a required criterion for diagnosis.
* Option C: Electron microscopy findings, such as widespread effacement of podocyte foot processes, can support the diagnosis of FSGS, but they are not necessary for establishing a presumptive diagnosis.
* Option D: Elevated serum levels of soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) have been associated with FSGS, but they are not a diagnostic criterion.
* Option E: Elevated plasma levels of a permeability-inducing factor by bioassay are not a established diagnostic criterion for FSGS.

It's essential to note that the diagnosis of FSGS should be made in conjunction with clinical and laboratory findings, as well as the exclusion of other potential causes of nephrotic syndrome.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the next BEST step in this patient’s management?,C,"The correct answer is C. Order a chest radiograph.

Here's why:

The patient has a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) result, with 15 mm of induration, which is a strong indicator of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Given the patient's age, country of origin, and planned initiation of hemodialysis, it's essential to rule out active tuberculosis (TB) before starting dialysis.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, like this patient, undergo evaluation for LTBI before starting hemodialysis.

Ordering a chest radiograph is the next best step to evaluate for signs of active TB, such as infiltrates, cavities, or lymphadenopathy. This will help determine if the patient has active TB or LTBI.

Here's why the other options are not the best choice:

A. Performing a 10-tuberculin-units PPD tuberculin skin test is not necessary, as the patient has already had a positive result with the 5-tuberculin-units PPD test.

B. While an interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) could be used to confirm LTBI, it's not the next best step in this scenario. A chest radiograph is a more immediate priority to rule out active TB.

D. Although the patient was born in South Korea, where BCG vaccination is common, he does not recall receiving the vaccination. Moreover, a positive TST result in a patient with advanced chronic kidney disease warrants further evaluation, regardless of BCG vaccination history.

E. Initiating isoniazid prophylaxis without first ruling out active TB is not appropriate. The patient needs further evaluation, including a chest radiograph, before starting prophylaxis.

Remember, it's essential to prioritize the patient's safety and rule out active TB before starting hemodialysis.",Success
Which ONE of the following factors is associated with an INCREASED risk of transition from home HD to in-center dialysis in this patient?,B,"The correct answer is B. Active smoking/substance abuse.

Studies have shown that smoking and substance abuse are associated with an increased risk of transition from home dialysis to in-center dialysis. Smoking can lead to vascular access complications, such as thrombosis and stenosis, which can make it difficult to maintain a functional AVF, ultimately requiring a switch to in-center dialysis. Additionally, substance abuse can impact a patient's ability to adhere to their treatment regimen, including home dialysis, and may lead to increased hospitalizations and complications.

The other options are not directly associated with an increased risk of transition from home HD to in-center dialysis:

A. Age: While older patients may have more comorbidities, age itself is not a significant factor in this scenario.

C. History of kidney transplantation: This patient's history of kidney transplantation does not directly impact their current home HD treatment.

D. Use of AVF compared with a central venous catheter: In fact, having a well-matured AVF is a positive factor, as it is associated with better outcomes and fewer complications compared to central venous catheters.

E. Residence proximate to his dialysis center: Living close to the dialysis center may actually be a convenience factor, making it easier for the patient to attend in-center dialysis sessions if needed, but it is not a risk factor for transitioning from home HD to in-center dialysis.",Success
Which ONE of the following interventions is MOST likely to reduce the duration of the recovery time after dialysis for this man?,C,"The correct answer is C. An increase in dialysate sodium to 140 mEq/L.

The patient is experiencing a prolonged recovery time after dialysis, feeling ""drained"" for several hours. This is likely due to intradialytic hypotension, which can cause symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. Although the patient does not have postural hypotension, his average postdialysis BP is lower than his predialysis BP, suggesting that he may be experiencing some degree of hypotension during or after dialysis.

Increasing the dialysate sodium concentration to 140 mEq/L can help reduce the incidence and severity of intradialytic hypotension. This is because a higher sodium concentration in the dialysate can help to reduce the removal of sodium from the patient's blood, thereby minimizing the decrease in blood pressure during dialysis. This intervention is supported by the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, which recommend using a dialysate sodium concentration of 140 mEq/L to help prevent intradialytic hypotension.

The other options are not likely to reduce the duration of the recovery time after dialysis:

A. Increasing the dialysate potassium concentration may help to reduce the risk of cardiac arrhythmias, but it is not likely to affect the patient's recovery time.

B. Reducing the blood flow rate may help to reduce the risk of intradialytic hypotension, but it may also reduce the efficiency of dialysis and increase the patient's recovery time.

D. Decreasing the dialysis frequency to twice weekly may lead to inadequate dialysis and worsen the patient's overall health, including his recovery time after dialysis.",Success
Which ONE of the following outcomes is predicted from stent graft placement at the venous anastomosis after angioplasty versus angioplasty alone?,B,"The correct answer is B. Superior patency at 6, 12, and 24 months.

According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, stent graft placement after angioplasty has been shown to improve patency rates compared to angioplasty alone for stenotic lesions at the venous anastomosis of arteriovenous grafts. Studies have demonstrated superior patency rates at 6, 12, and 24 months with stent graft placement, likely due to the ability of the stent graft to maintain the lumen diameter and reduce restenosis.

The other options are not supported by current evidence:

A. Stent graft placement has been shown to have a benefit compared to angioplasty alone in terms of patency rates.

C. While stent graft placement may require subsequent interventions, the rate of these interventions is not increased compared to angioplasty alone.

D. The rate of adverse events is not higher with stent graft placement compared to angioplasty alone.

It's essential to note that the decision to place a stent graft should be individualized based on the patient's specific situation and anatomy, and should be made in consultation with an interventional nephrologist or radiologist.",Success
Which one of the following is MOST correct?,D,"The correct answer is A. The nephrologist should be worried about mineral and bone-related parameters, as CKD-MBD is associated with poor outcomes.

This patient has stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on her serum creatinine level of 3.7 mg/dl. CKD-Mineral and Bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) is a common complication of CKD, and it is associated with poor outcomes, including increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, bone fractures, and decreased quality of life.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend that patients with CKD stage 3 or higher should be evaluated for CKD-MBD, which includes assessment of mineral metabolism (calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone levels) and bone health.

Option B is incorrect because CKD-MBD can occur at any stage of CKD, not just stage 5. Option C is incorrect because cardiovascular morbidity and mortality increase as CKD progresses, with the highest risk in stage 5. Option D is incorrect because while extraosseous calcifications can be a marker of cardiovascular risk, they are not a better way to assess cardiovascular risk compared to clinical history and laboratory results.",Success
Which of the following beneﬁts are associated with HHD compared with PD and transplantation?,D,"The correct answer is D. HHD has been associated with improved survival compared with PD in patients who have been on in-center HD for longer than 1 year.

Home hemodialysis (HHD) has been shown to have several benefits compared to peritoneal dialysis (PD) and in-center hemodialysis (HD). While transplantation is the gold standard for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), it's not a viable option for this patient at present.

Studies have demonstrated that HHD is associated with improved survival compared to PD, particularly in patients who have been on in-center HD for longer than 1 year (1, 2). This is likely due to the increased frequency and duration of dialysis sessions with HHD, which can lead to better fluid and solute removal, as well as improved blood pressure control.

In contrast, there is no evidence to suggest that HHD is associated with improved survival compared to transplantation, whether from living or deceased donors. In fact, transplantation is generally considered the best option for patients with ESKD, as it offers superior survival outcomes and quality of life compared to dialysis (3).

Which ONE of the following would be the MOST appropriate alternative for the allograft protocol biopsy?,D,"The correct answer is D. Assess for donor-derived cell-free DNA.

The 1-year protocol allograft biopsy is typically performed to assess for subclinical rejection or other allograft injuries. However, in this case, the patient is at increased risk of bleeding complications due to the use of aspirin and oral anticoagulants, making the biopsy a higher-risk procedure.

Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) is a non-invasive biomarker that can be used to monitor allograft function and detect rejection. It has been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for allograft injury and rejection. Assessing for dd-cfDNA would be a suitable alternative to the protocol biopsy, as it does not carry the same bleeding risks and can provide valuable information about the allograft's status.

The other options are not directly related to assessing allograft function or rejection:

A. Non-HLA antibodies are not typically associated with allograft rejection or injury.

B. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia is a potential complication after transplantation, but it is not a substitute for assessing allograft function.

C. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a non-specific inflammatory marker that may be elevated in various conditions, including infection or inflammation, but it is not a reliable indicator of allograft rejection or injury.

Therefore, option D, assessing for donor-derived cell-free DNA, is the most appropriate alternative to the allograft protocol biopsy in this scenario.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell him regarding the potential beneﬁts and risks he will derive from anticoagulation for atrial ﬁbrillation?,C,"The correct answer is B. It will lower his risk of ischemic stroke.

The patient has newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation, which increases his risk of ischemic stroke. Anticoagulation therapy is recommended to reduce this risk. According to the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, anticoagulation therapy is recommended for patients with atrial fibrillation and a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or higher. The patient's age, hypertension, diabetes, and kidney disease all contribute to a high CHA2DS2-VASc score, indicating a high risk of stroke.

Option A is incorrect because anticoagulation therapy does increase the risk of bleeding, particularly in patients with kidney disease.

Option C is incorrect because while anticoagulation therapy may reduce the risk of stroke, it has not been shown to lower mortality risk in patients with atrial fibrillation and kidney disease.

Option D is incorrect because both warfarin and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been shown to be effective in reducing stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation and kidney disease. However, DOACs may be preferred in patients with stage 4 CKD due to their more predictable pharmacokinetics and lower risk of bleeding.",Success
"Assuming insensible water losses of 0.8 L/d, which ONE of the following is the total amount of free water that should be administered to decrease the serum sodium to 145 mEq/L over the next 24 hours?",A,"To calculate the total amount of free water needed to decrease the serum sodium to 145 mEq/L, we need to use the following formula:

Total water deficit = (Current sodium - Desired sodium) / (Current sodium) x Total body water

First, let's calculate the total body water (TBW):

TBW = 0.6 x Weight (in kg) = 0.6 x 60 kg = 36 L

Now, let's plug in the values:

Total water deficit = (155 - 145) / 155 x 36 L = 1.43 L

Since the patient has a urine output of 2 L/d and insensible water losses of 0.8 L/d, the total daily water losses are:

Total daily water losses = Urine output + Insensible water losses = 2 L/d + 0.8 L/d = 2.8 L/d

To decrease the serum sodium to 145 mEq/L over the next 24 hours, we need to add the total water deficit to the total daily water losses:

Total free water needed = Total water deficit + Total daily water losses = 1.43 L + 2.8 L = 4.23 L

Rounding up to the nearest whole number, the correct answer is:

D. 4 L",Success
"With respect to her obesity, what is the ONE next best step in her evaluation?",C,"The correct answer is C. Counsel her on her higher relative risk for future ESKD after donation compared with normal weight candidates but low overall absolute risk.

According to the American Society of Transplantation (AST) and the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) guidelines, obesity (BMI ≥30) is a relative contraindication for living kidney donation. While obesity is a risk factor for end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), the absolute risk of ESKD after donation is still low.

In this scenario, the patient's BMI of 31.3 indicates obesity, but her overall health and kidney function are normal. The guidelines recommend that obese individuals be counseled about their higher relative risk of ESKD after donation compared to normal-weight candidates. However, this does not necessarily mean she should be declined as a donor.

The next step would be to have an open and informed discussion with the patient about the potential risks associated with obesity and kidney donation, including the possibility of future ESKD. This will allow her to make an informed decision about proceeding with the donation process.

Option A is incorrect because a BMI >30 is not an absolute contraindication for living kidney donation. Option B is also incorrect because, although her BMI is <35, obesity is still a relative contraindication, and she should be counseled about the potential risks.",Success
"In addition to holding nivolumab, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate initial treatment?",B,"The correct answer is B. Prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg per day.

The patient is experiencing AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) likely due to nivolumab therapy, an immune checkpoint inhibitor. The urinalysis results suggest an inflammatory response in the kidneys, with leukocytes and leukocyte casts present. The patient's symptoms are mild, and he is not experiencing severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.

In this scenario, the most appropriate initial treatment is to administer prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg per day to reduce the inflammatory response and potentially reverse the AKI. This is a common approach for managing immune-related adverse events associated with checkpoint inhibitors.

Option A, ""No further treatment,"" is not appropriate, as the patient's AKI requires intervention to prevent further kidney damage.

Option C, ""Plasma exchange,"" is not indicated in this scenario, as there is no evidence of a thrombotic microangiopathy or other conditions that would require plasma exchange.

Option D, ""Rituximab,"" is an immunotherapy medication used to treat certain types of cancer and autoimmune disorders, but it is not relevant to the management of AKI in this context.

It's essential to note that the patient's nivolumab therapy should be held until the AKI resolves, and the patient's kidney function returns to baseline.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in management?,E,"The correct answer is D. Terminate the current treatment and observe the patient carefully.

The patient has chronic hyponatremia due to beer potomania, and his serum sodium level has been corrected to 132 mmol/L after 24 hours of treatment. The goal of treatment is to correct the sodium level slowly and safely, as rapid correction can lead to central pontine myelinolysis (CPM).

The patient's current sodium level of 132 mmol/L is within a safe range, and he is asymptomatic. Continuing to correct the sodium level further may put him at risk of overcorrection, which can also lead to complications.

Option A is incorrect because continuing to correct the sodium level to 135 mmol/L may be too aggressive and may lead to overcorrection. Option B is also incorrect because the patient is already asymptomatic, and further correction of sodium levels may not be necessary. Option C is not necessary at this time, as the patient's potassium level is already improving. Option E is incorrect because there is no indication to re-lower the serum sodium level, and desmopressin is not typically used in the management of hyponatremia due to beer potomania.

Terminating the current treatment and observing the patient carefully is the most appropriate next step, as it allows for careful monitoring of the patient's sodium levels and avoids the risk of overcorrection or other complications.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements is MOST correct?,A,"The correct answer is B. Although exceptions may occur, immunoﬂuorescence microscopy generally shows both IgG and C3 deposits in C3GN but not postinfectious GN.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation with a flu-like syndrome 6 weeks ago, followed by hematuria, proteinuria, and a diffuse proliferative pattern on biopsy, is consistent with postinfectious glomerulonephritis (GN). However, the immunoﬂuorescence microscopy showing both C3 and IgG deposition suggests C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN).

In postinfectious GN, immunoﬂuorescence typically shows only C3 deposits, whereas in C3GN, both IgG and C3 deposits are commonly seen. This distinction is important, as C3GN is a rare and aggressive form of GN that requires different management and prognosis compared to postinfectious GN.

Option A is incorrect because postinfectious GN typically shows only C3 deposits, not both IgG and C3. Option C is incorrect because light microscopy cannot reliably distinguish between C3GN and postinfectious GN. Option D is incorrect because a genetic screen may be useful in identifying genetic mutations associated with C3GN, which could help distinguish it from postinfectious GN.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the next BEST step in management?,D,"The correct answer is D. Continue to use the fistula with blood flows < 450 ml/min.

The patient has a functioning right upper arm arteriovenous fistula, which has been successfully used for home HD for 2 months. Although the fistulogram and central venography show bilateral brachiocephalic vein occlusion, the patient has not experienced any complications, and his laboratory studies indicate that he is meeting urea clearance targets and has acceptable acid-base balance, electrolytes, and CKD mineral and bone disorder chemistry results.

Given the patient's history of thrombosis in a previous fistula and the presence of extensive collateralization, it is reasonable to continue using the current fistula with caution. The key is to maintain blood flows below 450 ml/min, which have not been associated with high venous pressures or other problems.

Option A, treating the left brachiocephalic vein occlusion, may not be necessary at this time, as the patient is not experiencing any symptoms or complications related to the occlusion. Option B, establishing a new catheter access, is not indicated, as the patient has a functioning fistula. Option C, stopping the use of the fistula and transitioning to a translumbar catheter, is not justified, as the fistula is still functional and can be used safely with proper management.",Success
"In addition to intravenous methylprednisolone (500–1000 mg/d three times) followed by oral prednisone beginning at 1 mg/kg per day, which ONE of the following approaches is the MOST appropriate induction therapy for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Either intravenous cyclophosphamide or intravenous rituximab.

This patient has pauciimmune necrotizing GN, which is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition. The presence of anti-proteinase-3-ANCA (PR3-ANCA) suggests a diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), a type of ANCA-associated vasculitis.

The American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommend a combination of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive therapy as induction therapy for GPA. In this case, the patient is already receiving intravenous methylprednisolone, which is appropriate. For immunosuppressive therapy, the guidelines recommend either cyclophosphamide or rituximab.

Cyclophosphamide is a traditional choice for induction therapy in GPA, and it has been shown to be effective in inducing remission. Rituximab, a B-cell depleting agent, is also a recommended option, particularly in patients with PR3-ANCA-positive GPA. Both options have been shown to be effective in inducing remission and improving outcomes in patients with GPA.

Methotrexate (option A) is not typically used as induction therapy for GPA, and mycophenolate mofetil (option C) is not recommended as a first-line agent for GPA. Plasmapheresis (option D) may be considered as an adjunctive therapy in certain situations, such as in patients with severe disease or those who are refractory to other treatments, but it is not a recommended induction therapy for GPA.

Therefore, the most appropriate induction therapy for this patient, in addition to glucocorticoids, is either intravenous cyclophosphamide or intravenous rituximab.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell the advanced-practice provider regarding initiation of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in this patient?,A,"The correct answer is D. An erythropoiesis-stimulating agent should be held when hemoglobin levels exceed 10.0 g/dl.

According to the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are recommended for patients with CKD and anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dl) who are not undergoing dialysis. The guidelines also suggest that ESAs should be titrated to maintain a hemoglobin level between 10 and 11.5 g/dl, and that the dose should be reduced or held if the hemoglobin level exceeds 11.5 g/dl.

In this case, the patient's hemoglobin level is 8.9 g/dl, which is below the target range. However, the advanced-practice provider should be aware that the ESA dose should be adjusted or held if the hemoglobin level exceeds 10.0 g/dl to minimize the risk of adverse effects.

Options A, B, and C are incorrect because:

A. ESAs may have a beneficial effect on CKD progression by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.

B. ESAs have been shown to improve functionality and exercise tolerance in patients with CKD and anemia.

C. ESAs can reduce the need for blood transfusions in patients with CKD and anemia.",Success
Which ONE of the following is most likely a risk factor for his hypocalcemia?,D,"The correct answer is B. Hypoalbuminemia.

The patient's serum calcium level dropped to 7.2 mg/dl six hours after surgery, indicating hypocalcemia. Hypoalbuminemia, with a serum albumin level of 3.2 g/dl, is a significant risk factor for hypocalcemia. Albumin binds to calcium, and low albumin levels can lead to a decrease in total calcium levels, making the patient more susceptible to hypocalcemia.

Hyperphosphatemia (option A) can contribute to hypocalcemia, but in this scenario, the patient's phosphorus level is 7.5 mg/dl, which is elevated but not extremely high. Hypercalcemia (option C) is the opposite of hypocalcemia, so it's not a risk factor. High serum alkaline phosphatase (option D) is often seen in patients with severe hyperparathyroidism, but it's not directly related to the development of hypocalcemia.

It's essential to note that the patient's history of ESKD and maintenance hemodialysis may also contribute to his hypocalcemia, as patients with ESKD often have impaired calcium metabolism and may be more prone to hypocalcemia. However, among the options provided, hypoalbuminemia is the most likely risk factor for his hypocalcemia.",Success
Which of the following is correct with regard to initiation of PD?,B,"The correct answer is C. Biocompatible PD solutions have been associated with lower rates of PD peritonitis.

Here's why:

* Option A is incorrect: Studies have shown that incremental PD (starting with lower doses and gradually increasing) is associated with better preservation of residual renal function (RRF) compared to ""full-dose"" PD.
* Option B is incorrect: While both automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) have their own advantages and disadvantages, APD is not necessarily associated with a lower risk of technique failure.
* Option D is incorrect: Icodextrin-based PD solutions have been shown to be associated with better preservation of RRF, not more rapid loss.

Biocompatible PD solutions, on the other hand, have been associated with lower rates of PD peritonitis, which is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis. Biocompatible solutions are designed to minimize the inflammatory response and reduce the risk of peritonitis.

In this patient's case, considering her advanced age, multiple comorbidities, and declining energy levels, it's essential to discuss the options and potential benefits of peritoneal dialysis, including the use of biocompatible PD solutions to minimize complications.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate dosing regimen for intravenous magnesium for this patient?,C,"The correct answer is C. A reduction in the loading dose and the maintenance dose.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM), women with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) may require dose adjustments for intravenous magnesium sulfate due to decreased renal clearance.

The typical dosing regimen for magnesium sulfate in preeclampsia is a 4-6 gram loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 1-2 grams per hour. However, in patients with ESRD, the loading dose and maintenance dose should be reduced to avoid magnesium toxicity.

The recommended dose reduction for patients with ESRD is a loading dose of 2-3 grams followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5-1 gram per hour. This is because magnesium is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, and patients with ESRD may have impaired magnesium clearance.

Therefore, in this scenario, the most appropriate dosing regimen for intravenous magnesium would be a reduction in both the loading dose and the maintenance dose to avoid magnesium toxicity in the patient with ESRD.",Success
Double-positive MPO and PR3-ANCA is associated with which of the following?,D,"The correct answer is C. Increased risk of mortality.

The presence of both PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA, also known as double-positive ANCA, is a rare phenomenon, occurring in approximately 10-20% of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). Studies have shown that double-positive ANCA is associated with a higher risk of mortality, particularly in the first year after diagnosis.

A 2017 study published in the Journal of Rheumatology found that double-positive ANCA was an independent predictor of mortality in patients with AAV. Another study published in 2019 in the journal Arthritis Research & Therapy also found that double-positive ANCA was associated with increased mortality and more severe disease activity.

While options A and B may be associated with AAV, they are not specifically linked to double-positive ANCA. Option D, drug-induced AAV, is not directly related to the presence of double-positive ANCA.

It's essential to note that the patient's symptoms, such as necrotic skin ulcers, arthralgias, and myalgias, are consistent with AAV, and the positive titers for both PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA support this diagnosis. The patient's neutropenia and hematuria also suggest active vasculitis.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in the management of this patient?,D,"The correct answer is D. Refer for adrenal vein sampling.

The patient's laboratory results suggest primary aldosteronism, which is a common cause of resistant hypertension. The low plasma renin activity and high plasma aldosterone level are consistent with this diagnosis. The abdominal CT scan showing a right adrenal adenoma further supports this diagnosis.

However, before proceeding with surgery, it is essential to confirm that the adenoma is indeed the source of the aldosterone excess. Adrenal vein sampling is the gold standard test to lateralize aldosterone production and determine whether the adenoma is functioning or non-functioning. This test involves sampling blood from both adrenal veins and measuring aldosterone levels to determine which adrenal gland is producing excessive aldosterone.

Referring the patient for surgery (Option A) without adrenal vein sampling may lead to unnecessary surgery if the adenoma is non-functioning. Adding spironolactone (Option B) or amiloride (Option C) may help control blood pressure, but they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient.

Adrenal vein sampling will provide valuable information to guide further management, including surgical intervention if necessary.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely cause of the MRI ﬁndings in this woman?,A,"The correct answer is A. Hypercalcemia.

The patient's MRI findings are consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which is a rare but reversible neurologic disorder. The most common causes of PRES are hypertension, eclampsia, and cytotoxic medications. However, in this case, the patient's blood pressure is consistently normal, making hypertension an unlikely cause.

The patient's laboratory results show a significantly elevated calcium level of 14.5 mg/dl, which is a common complication of metastatic breast cancer. Hypercalcemia can cause PRES by inducing vasospasm and endothelial dysfunction, leading to cerebral edema.

While acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperphosphatemia may contribute to the patient's overall condition, they are not directly related to the development of PRES. Masked hypertension is also unlikely, as the patient's blood pressure is consistently normal throughout her hospital course.

It is essential to note that the patient's hypercalcemia should be promptly treated to prevent further complications and improve her neurologic symptoms.",Success
"Compared with tacrolimus/mycophenolate-based immunosuppression, which ONE of the following is the MOST likely clinical outcome of using tacrolimus/everolimus/prednisone in the absence of CMV prophylaxis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Lower incidence of CMV viremia.

The use of everolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, in combination with tacrolimus and prednisone is associated with a lower incidence of CMV viremia compared to tacrolimus/mycophenolate-based immunosuppression. This is because mTOR inhibitors have been shown to have antiviral properties and can reduce the risk of CMV infection (1, 2).

In this scenario, the patient is CMV negative, and the donor is CMV positive, which puts the patient at risk of developing CMV infection. The use of tacrolimus/everolimus/prednisone without CMV prophylaxis may reduce this risk.

"On the basis of published retrospective cohort studies, resuscitation with which ONE of the following types of intravenous ﬂuids is LEAST likely to be associated with the development of severe AKI in this patient?",B,"Based on published retrospective cohort studies, the correct answer is:

B. Isotonic balanced electrolyte solution

Rationale:

* 0.9% Saline (Option A) has been associated with a higher risk of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) due to its high chloride content, which can cause renal vasoconstriction and tubular injury.
* D5W with sodium bicarbonate at 100 mEq/L (Option C) is not a commonly used resuscitation fluid, and its effect on AKI is not well-studied.
* Hydroxyethyl starch (Option D) has been shown to increase the risk of AKI and renal failure, particularly in critically ill patients.
* Isotonic balanced electrolyte solutions (Option B), such as lactated Ringer's solution or Plasma-Lyte, have been associated with a lower risk of AKI compared to 0.9% Saline. These solutions have a more physiological pH and electrolyte composition, which may help reduce the risk of renal injury.

It's essential to note that the choice of resuscitation fluid should be individualized based on the patient's specific needs and medical history. However, in this scenario, an isotonic balanced electrolyte solution is the least likely to be associated with the development of severe AKI.",Success
Which of the follow is true regarding HHD?,A,"The correct answer is B. Use of HHD, but not PD, increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a shift towards home-based kidney replacement therapies to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in dialysis centers and to conserve healthcare resources. Hemodialysis (HHD) is a type of home kidney replacement therapy that involves using a machine to filter waste products from the blood.

Studies have shown that the use of HHD increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it allowed patients to receive dialysis in the comfort of their own homes, reducing their exposure to the virus. On the other hand, peritoneal dialysis (PD), another type of home kidney replacement therapy, did not experience a significant increase in use during the pandemic.

It's essential to note that the pandemic highlighted the importance of home-based kidney replacement therapies, and efforts should be made to continue promoting and expanding these services to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden on healthcare systems.

Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate initial treatment for this patient?,B,"The correct answer is B. 3% NaCl bolus IV (100 mL over 10 minutes up to x 3).

The patient has severe cerebral edema caused by acute hyponatremia, which is a life-threatening condition. The goal of initial treatment is to rapidly correct the sodium level and reduce cerebral edema. The most appropriate initial treatment is a bolus of 3% sodium chloride (hypertonic saline) to rapidly increase the sodium level.

The American Heart Association and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine recommend a bolus of 3% sodium chloride (100-150 mL) over 10-15 minutes, which can be repeated up to 3 times, to rapidly correct severe hyponatremia.

Option A, loop diuretic (furosemide) IV, is not the primary treatment for hyponatremia and may actually worsen the condition by increasing urine output and further diluting sodium levels.

Option C, 3% NaCl infusion (100 ml/h), is not as effective as a bolus in rapidly correcting sodium levels and may not provide sufficient correction in a timely manner.

Options D and E, tolvaptan and urea, respectively, are medications used to treat hyponatremia, but they are not the most appropriate initial treatment for severe cerebral edema caused by acute hyponatremia.

It's essential to note that the patient should be closely monitored in the intensive care unit, and further management should include correction of sodium levels, management of seizures, and supportive care.",Success
"Question 5828
Which ONE of the following statements about the treatment of post-transplantation osteoporosis is most CORRECT?",D,"The correct answer is D. Bisphosphonate therapy is associated with improvements in bone mineral densitometry scores after transplantation.

Explanation: Post-transplantation osteoporosis is a common complication of solid organ transplantation, particularly in kidney and liver transplant recipients. Bisphosphonates, such as alendronate and zoledronic acid, are commonly used to treat osteoporosis in this population. Studies have consistently shown that bisphosphonate therapy improves bone mineral density (BMD) in transplant recipients, reducing the risk of fractures.

While raloxifene (option A) may improve BMD in some populations, its effectiveness in transplant recipients is less clear. Teriparatide (option B) has been shown to increase BMD in some studies, but its effect on fracture risk after kidney transplantation is not well established. Denosumab (option C) is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits RANKL, a protein involved in osteoclast activation, and has been used to treat osteoporosis in some populations. However, its safety and efficacy in transplant recipients are not well established. Vitamin D analogues (option E) may be used to treat vitamin D deficiency, which is common in transplant recipients, but their effect on fracture risk after transplantation is not well established.

It's essential to note that the management of post-transplantation osteoporosis should be individualized, taking into account the patient's underlying medical condition, medications, and other risk factors for osteoporosis. A thorough evaluation, including BMD measurement and laboratory tests, should guide treatment decisions.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell him about PHS-IRD kidneys?,D,"The correct answer is D. His risk of contracting HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis B virus from a PHS-IRD donor is < 1%.

Here's why:

* Option A is incorrect because transplantation of PHS-IRD kidneys is actually associated with a shorter waiting time, not an increased waiting time.
* Option B is incorrect because kidneys from individuals with increased risk behaviors currently make up around 20-30% of all deceased donors, not < 10%.
* Option C is incorrect because kidneys from intravenous drug users can be used for transplantation, but they are classified as PHS-IRD kidneys and require additional informed consent from the recipient.
* Option D is correct because the risk of contracting HIV, HCV, or HBV from a PHS-IRD donor is indeed less than 1%. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the risk of transmission of these viruses through organ transplantation is extremely low, thanks to rigorous screening and testing protocols.

It's essential to have an open and honest discussion with the patient about the benefits and risks of PHS-IRD kidneys, addressing his concerns and providing accurate information to help him make an informed decision.",Success
What is the best course of action for this patient?,B,"The correct answer is B. Perform a complete metabolic assessment, including 24-hour urine for calcium, oxalate, citrate, uric acid, and electrolytes, to establish mechanisms for his hypercalciuria.

This patient has a strong family history of kidney stones and has had recurrent nephrolithiasis since age 18. Although he has not had an episode of colic in the past 3 years, his 24-hour urine collection shows hypercalciuria, which is a significant risk factor for stone formation. A complete metabolic assessment is necessary to identify the underlying mechanisms contributing to his hypercalciuria and to guide further management.

Option A is incorrect because a low calcium intake is not recommended for patients with hypercalciuria. In fact, a diet with adequate calcium intake can help reduce oxalate absorption and stone risk.

Option C is incorrect because, despite the absence of new stone formation in the past 3 years, the patient's hypercalciuria and strong family history indicate a high risk for future stone recurrence. Doing nothing and following up in a few months would not address the underlying causes of his stone disease.

Option D is incorrect because, although genetic testing may not be immediately necessary, it could be considered in the future, especially if the patient has a family history of kidney stones on both sides of his family. However, this is not the primary concern at this point, and a complete metabolic assessment should be the first step in managing his condition.",Success
Which of the following CKD stages is NOT considered very high risk for CKD progression?,B,"Based on the patient's eGFR of 58 ml/min per 1.73 m2, I would categorize him as having CKD stage G3a.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 guidelines, CKD stage G3a is defined as an eGFR of 45-59 ml/min per 1.73 m2.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A. CKD G3aA3: This stage is considered high risk for CKD progression due to the presence of albuminuria (A3).

B. CKD G3bA1: This stage is also considered high risk for CKD progression due to the decreased eGFR (G3b) and the absence of albuminuria (A1) does not mitigate the risk.

C. CKD G3bA2: Similar to option B, this stage is considered high risk for CKD progression due to the decreased eGFR (G3b) and the presence of albuminuria (A2) further increasing the risk.

D. CKD G4A1: This stage is considered very high risk for CKD progression due to the severely decreased eGFR (G4) and the absence of albuminuria (A1) does not reduce the risk.

Based on the above analysis, I would choose option A. CKD G3aA3 as the correct answer, as CKD stage G3aA1 would be the correct categorization for the patient, and it is not considered very high risk for CKD progression.

It's essential to note that while CKD stage G3aA1 is not considered very high risk, the patient's history of nephrectomy and underlying renal cell carcinoma may still impact his kidney function and increase his risk of progressing to end-stage renal disease. A thorough discussion with the patient about his individual risk factors, lifestyle modifications, and regular monitoring is crucial to slow down CKD progression.",Success
"In addition to an appropriately targeted anti-biotic regimen, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate initial management strategy for this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Intravenous isotonic crystalloid solution and/or albumin tailored to her hemodynamic status with addition of vasopressors if unresponsive to fluids/albumin.

This patient is presenting with sepsis, as evidenced by her fever, hypotension, and tachycardia. The initial management strategy should focus on fluid resuscitation to restore hemodynamic stability. The American College of Critical Care Medicine (ACCM) and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommend administering intravenous isotonic crystalloid solution and/or albumin to achieve a goal of 30 mL/kg of crystalloid within the first 3 hours of sepsis recognition.

In this case, option D is the most appropriate initial management strategy because it prioritizes fluid resuscitation tailored to the patient's hemodynamic status, with the addition of vasopressors if the patient remains hypotensive despite adequate fluid administration. This approach is consistent with the ACCM and Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines.

Option A is incorrect because it focuses solely on achieving a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >70 mmHg, which may not be the most important initial goal in sepsis management. Option B is also incorrect because vasopressors should not be the initial therapy in sepsis; instead, they should be added if the patient remains hypotensive despite adequate fluid administration. Option C is not relevant to the patient's current presentation, as there is no indication for transfusion based on the provided laboratory results.",Success
Which ONE of the following is MOST correct regarding the International IgAN Prediction Tool?,C,"The correct answer is B. Clinical variables, such as proteinuria, but not histology inform the risk score.

The International IgAN Prediction Tool is a validated risk prediction model that estimates the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in patients with IgA nephropathy. The tool uses clinical variables such as proteinuria, blood pressure, and eGFR, but does not include histological features from the biopsy. This is because the tool is designed to be used in clinical practice, where histological data may not always be available or up-to-date.

The 2021 KDIGO guidelines do not recommend using the International IgAN Prediction Tool to inform treatment decisions, such as whether or not to use glucocorticoids (Option A). While the tool can provide valuable prognostic information, it is not intended to guide treatment choices.

The International IgAN Prediction Tool has not been updated to incorporate variables obtained 1-2 years after biopsy (Option C). The original tool was developed using data from a large cohort of patients with IgA nephropathy, and its predictive performance has been validated in multiple studies.

Finally, the International IgAN Prediction Tool is a freely available online calculator that does not require sophisticated software or incur additional costs (Option D). It can be easily accessed and used by healthcare providers to estimate the risk of ESKD in their patients with IgA nephropathy.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements is CORRECT with regard to her long-term BP variability?,A,"The correct answer is A. Increased long-term BP variability is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events despite adequate BP control on most visits.

Research has shown that long-term blood pressure (BP) variability is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events, including stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality. This association holds true even when average BP is well-controlled. The fluctuations in BP over time may contribute to end-organ damage, such as vascular stiffening, inflammation, and oxidative stress, which can increase cardiovascular risk.

The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology guidelines acknowledge the importance of BP variability in cardiovascular risk assessment. A 2016 study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that increased long-term BP variability was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events, even in patients with well-controlled average BP.

Option B is incorrect because increased long-term BP variability is associated with increased cardiovascular risk regardless of the average BP level. Option C is also incorrect because beta-blockers may actually increase BP variability in some patients. Option D is incorrect because there is a clear relationship between long-term BP variability and cardiovascular events.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST accurate statement regarding the impact of the AKI episode on his long-term cardiovascular prognosis?,B,"The correct answer is B. It increases his risk of incident congestive heart failure.

According to current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a strong predictor of long-term cardiovascular events, including congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Even a single episode of AKI, as experienced by this patient, can increase the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events.

The American Heart Association and the National Kidney Foundation have recognized AKI as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Studies have consistently shown that AKI is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, even after adjusting for underlying kidney disease and other comorbidities.

Option A is incorrect because AKI does have an impact on subsequent cardiovascular risk. Option C is also incorrect because the severity of AKI, including dialysis-requiring AKI, is not the only determinant of cardiovascular risk. Even non-dialysis-requiring AKI, as in this patient's case, can increase cardiovascular risk. Option D is incorrect because the fact that the patient's kidney function almost completely recovered to baseline does not negate the increased cardiovascular risk associated with AKI.",Success
"Current guidelines recommend the use of (TIMP-2) • (IGFBP7) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery to enable early detection of those in whom AKI will develop
C        The use of cell cycle arrest biomarker neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) can discriminate cardiac surgery patients at higher risk for AKI who might beneﬁt from measures such as early dialysis initiation",A,"The correct answer is D. Despite growing evidence of its potential role in preventing cardiac surgery-associated AKI, the urinary test (TIMP-2) • (IGFBP7) still lacks approval by the US Food and Drug Administration.

Explanation:

* Option A is incorrect because while the TIMP-2 • IGFBP7 test has shown promise in identifying high-risk patients, there is no conclusive evidence that it has been demonstrated to reduce the prevalence of severe AKI.
* Option B is incorrect because current guidelines do not recommend the routine use of TIMP-2 • IGFBP7 for early detection of AKI in cardiac surgery patients.
* Option C is incorrect because while renal functional reserve is an important concept, there is no established cutoff value of 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 to discriminate patients at risk for AKI development.
* Option D is the correct answer because, despite its potential role in preventing cardiac surgery-associated AKI, the TIMP-2 • IGFBP7 test has not received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this specific indication.",Success
Which of ONE the following is MOST likely to improve his survival?,C,"Based on the patient's condition, I would choose option D: Addition of sodium bicarbonate targeting a total CO2 level of 23 to 28 mmol/L.

The patient has stage G3b:A3 CKD, which indicates a moderate to severe decline in kidney function. He also has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The recent echocardiogram shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%, indicating heart failure.

The laboratory studies show a low total CO2 level of 21 mmol/L, which indicates metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis is a common complication of CKD and can worsen kidney function, increase cardiovascular risk, and decrease survival.

Adding sodium bicarbonate to target a total CO2 level of 23 to 28 mmol/L is likely to improve the patient's survival by:

1. Reducing the progression of CKD: Sodium bicarbonate supplementation has been shown to slow the decline in kidney function in patients with CKD.
2. Decreasing cardiovascular risk: Metabolic acidosis is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and correcting it may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.
3. Improving heart failure symptoms: Sodium bicarbonate may help improve heart failure symptoms by reducing the severity of metabolic acidosis.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's current condition and laboratory results. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (option A) may be considered for patients with heart failure and a wide QRS interval, but the patient's QRS interval is normal. Placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (option B) may be considered for patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death, but it is not directly related to the patient's current condition. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (option C) may be used to treat heart failure, but they are not specifically indicated for the patient's current condition.

It's essential to note that the patient's care should be individualized, and a comprehensive treatment plan should be developed in consultation with a nephrologist, cardiologist, and other relevant specialists.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely cause of her hypophosphatemia?,D,"Based on the patient's history and laboratory results, the most likely cause of her hypophosphatemia is:

D. Ferric carboxymaltose infusions

The patient received two doses of parenteral ferric carboxymaltose 500 mg for iron deficiency anemia 7 weeks prior to presentation. Ferric carboxymaltose is known to cause hypophosphatemia as a side effect, particularly at high doses. This is because ferric carboxymaltose can increase the expression of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), which in turn can lead to phosphaturia and hypophosphatemia.

The other options are less likely:

A. Oncogenic osteomalacia is a rare condition caused by tumors that produce FGF23, leading to hypophosphatemia. However, there is no mention of any tumors or masses in the patient's history.

B. Occult hyperparathyroidism is unlikely, as the patient's calcium level is normal.

C. Poor phosphate intake is unlikely, as the patient has no history of malnutrition or gastrointestinal disorders that could lead to malabsorption.

E. Autosomal dominant hypophosphatemia is a genetic disorder that typically presents in childhood, and the patient has no family history of bone or mineral metabolism disorders.

It's essential to consider the patient's recent treatment with ferric carboxymaltose as the most likely cause of her hypophosphatemia.",Success
"When considering this patient’s risk factors for cardiovascular outcomes and mortality, which of the following is correct?",D,"The correct answer is B. Monitoring of home BP has been associated with improved clinical outcomes.

Here's why:

* Option A is incorrect because, although hyperlipidemia is a cardiovascular risk factor, studies have shown that the relationship between LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular outcomes is less clear in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), including those on peritoneal dialysis (PD).
* Option C is incorrect because residual renal function (RRF) has been consistently shown to be a strong predictor of survival and cardiovascular outcomes in PD patients. Preservation of RRF is associated with better outcomes.
* Option D is incorrect because, although mortality rates for patients on PD have improved over time, the decline in mortality rates has not been more rapid than for patients on hemodialysis (HD).

Option B is correct because monitoring of home blood pressure (BP) has been associated with improved clinical outcomes, including better BP control and reduced cardiovascular events. This is particularly important in patients with ESKD, who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Home BP monitoring can help identify patients who require more intensive BP management and can improve patient engagement and adherence to therapy.",Success
What is the next best step in the management of this patient?,C,"The correct answer is C. Recommend that she purchase a validated home BP monitor and provide her with guidance on appropriate measurement technique.

According to the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines, when a patient is found to have elevated blood pressure (BP) in a non-clinical setting, such as a dentist's office, it is recommended to confirm the diagnosis with additional BP measurements before initiating treatment.

In this scenario, since the patient cannot come to the office for another month, recommending that she obtain kiosk-based BP measurements (Option B) may not provide accurate or reliable readings. Initiating antihypertensive medication (Options A and D) without a confirmed diagnosis and proper evaluation is not appropriate.

Instead, recommending that the patient purchase a validated home BP monitor (Option C) allows her to take accurate and reliable BP readings in the comfort of her own home. Providing guidance on appropriate measurement technique, such as taking multiple readings at different times of the day, sitting in a quiet room, and using the correct cuff size, will help ensure accurate readings.

This approach will allow the patient to monitor her BP and provide more accurate data for evaluation when she presents to the clinic in a month.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely cause of this woman’s acid-base abnormality?,B,"The correct answer is A. Nasogastric suction.

The patient's laboratory results show a metabolic alkalosis, characterized by an elevated pH (7.43) and a high bicarbonate level (total CO2 of 34 mmol/L). The most likely cause of this metabolic alkalosis is the nasogastric suction, which leads to the loss of hydrochloric acid and potassium in the stomach secretions. This results in a contraction alkalosis, where the volume depletion caused by the nasogastric suction stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to increased potassium and hydrogen ion excretion in the kidneys, further exacerbating the alkalosis.

The other options are not directly related to the development of metabolic alkalosis in this patient:

B. Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that can cause nephrotoxicity, but it is not typically associated with metabolic alkalosis.

C. Posthypercapnic alkalosis occurs when there is a sudden correction of respiratory acidosis, leading to a metabolic alkalosis. However, in this patient, there is no evidence of a sudden correction of respiratory acidosis.

D. Sodium chloride loss in sweat is not a significant contributor to metabolic alkalosis in this patient, as the urine sodium and chloride levels are not significantly low.

E. Ceftazidime is a cephalosporin antibiotic that is not typically associated with metabolic alkalosis.

It's worth noting that the patient's hypokalemia (potassium level of 2.3 mEq/L) is likely contributing to her muscle weakness and paresthesias, and should be addressed promptly.",Success
"Which of the following is the most appropriate option for the management of his APD, following the recent International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) guideline?",D,"Based on the patient's current situation, the most appropriate option for the management of his APD is:

B. Add a day dwell of icodextrin

Here's why:

* The patient's Kt/Vurea of 1.6 is adequate, indicating that his current APD regimen is providing sufficient small-solute clearance.
* However, his creatinine level of 9.0 mg/dl suggests that his middle-molecule clearance may be inadequate.
* According to the ISPD guidelines, icodextrin is recommended as a day dwell solution to improve middle-molecule clearance and reduce fluid absorption.
* Increasing the dwell treatment time (Option A) may not be necessary, as the patient's Kt/Vurea is already adequate.
* Switching to HD (Option C) is not indicated, as the patient is doing well on APD and has no uremic symptoms.
* Continuing the current APD regimen and reassessing later (Option D) may not address the patient's potential middle-molecule clearance issues.

By adding a day dwell of icodextrin, the patient's middle-molecule clearance can be improved, which may help to reduce his creatinine level and improve his overall dialysis outcomes.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you recommend?,D,"The correct answer is E. High-dose intravenous corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide for ANCA-associated nephritis.

The patient's presentation suggests a diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis, specifically microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), which is a type of small-vessel vasculitis. The positive MPO-ANCA, low serum C3 level, and presence of acanthocytes in the urine support this diagnosis. Acanthocytes are a type of red blood cell that is often seen in glomerular diseases, including MPA.

The patient's AKI is likely due to the vasculitis, rather than postinfectious glomerulonephritis (Option A), vancomycin toxicity (Option B), or acute tubular necrosis (Option C). While the patient's infection is being treated, the AKI is not resolving, and the urinalysis suggests an active inflammatory process in the kidneys.

A kidney biopsy (Option D) may be useful in confirming the diagnosis, but it is not necessary to initiate treatment. Given the patient's positive ANCA and low C3 level, it is likely that the biopsy would show evidence of MPA. Therefore, it is reasonable to start treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, which are the recommended therapies for ANCA-associated vasculitis.

It is important to note that prompt treatment is essential to prevent further kidney damage and improve outcomes in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell her about her pregnancy risk after live donor nephrectomy?,C,"The correct answer is C. Pregnancy after kidney donation is associated with an increased risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.

According to the American Society of Transplantation and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, women who have undergone live donor nephrectomy may be at increased risk for gestational hypertension and preeclampsia in future pregnancies. This is likely due to the decrease in renal mass and potential changes in blood pressure regulation.

The other options are not accurate:

A. While there is some evidence suggesting that pregnancies after kidney donation may be associated with low-birth weight infants, this is not a consistent finding across all studies.

B. There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that pregnancy after kidney donation is more likely to be complicated by preterm births.

D. There is no evidence to suggest that the risk of neonatal mortality is higher among kidney donors compared with nondonors.

It's essential to inform the patient about the potential risks associated with pregnancy after kidney donation, but it's also important to reassure her that many women have successful pregnancies after donating a kidney.",Success
Which ONE of the following has the greatest effect on mortality?,A,"The correct answer is A. AKI (Acute Kidney Injury).

In this scenario, the patient's development of AKI, as evidenced by the significant increase in serum creatinine (from 1.6 mg/dl to 4.3 mg/dl), is a critical factor that greatly impacts mortality. AKI is a known predictor of poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19, particularly those who require invasive mechanical ventilation.

Studies have consistently shown that AKI is associated with increased mortality in patients with COVID-19, with mortality rates ranging from 50% to over 80% in patients who develop AKI requiring dialysis. (1, 2)

While diabetes, hypertension, and proteinuria are all important comorbidities, they do not have the same level of impact on mortality in this scenario as AKI. Diabetes and hypertension are underlying conditions that may contribute to the patient's overall health status, but they are not directly responsible for the patient's acute deterioration. Proteinuria, as a marker of chronic kidney disease, is also important, but it is not as critical as the acute kidney injury in this scenario.

Which of the following may be the most suitable next choice of antibiotics?,D,"The correct answer is C. Add intraperitoneal linezolid.

Here's why:

* The patient has CAPD peritonitis, and Enterococcus species have been isolated from the peritoneal fluid culture.
* Cefazolin and ceftazidime are not effective against Enterococcus species, which is why the peritoneal fluid remains cloudy despite the patient being afebrile.
* Gentamicin (option B) is not a suitable choice because it is not effective against Enterococcus species and can also cause nephrotoxicity.
* Amoxicillin (option D) is not suitable for intraperitoneal administration, and oral administration may not provide adequate penetration into the peritoneal fluid.
* Linezolid (option C) is a suitable choice because it has excellent activity against Enterococcus species, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). It can be administered intraperitoneally and has a good safety profile.

The International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) guidelines recommend that antibiotics with activity against Enterococcus species, such as linezolid or ampicillin, be added to the treatment regimen if Enterococcus species are isolated from the peritoneal fluid culture.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?,B,"The correct answer is B. Entecavir.

This patient has hepatitis B–related cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension and membranous glomerulopathy, which is likely caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The kidney biopsy shows membranous nephropathy with positive staining for hepatitis B antigen, further supporting this diagnosis.

The goal of management is to treat the underlying HBV infection, which is contributing to the patient's kidney disease. Entecavir is a nucleoside analogue that is effective in suppressing HBV replication and has been shown to improve kidney outcomes in patients with HBV-related glomerulonephritis.

Pegylated interferón (option A) is not the best choice because it can exacerbate kidney disease and is not typically used in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

Rituximab (option C) is an immunosuppressive agent that may be used in some cases of membranous nephropathy, but it is not specifically indicated for HBV-related glomerulonephritis.

No antiviral or immunosuppressive therapy (option D) is not appropriate, as it would allow the HBV infection to continue unchecked, potentially leading to further kidney damage.

According to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines, entecavir is a recommended treatment for patients with HBV-related cirrhosis and kidney disease.",Success
"Before starting therapy, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in this patient’s diagnostic evaluation at this time?",E,"The correct answer is B. Genetic testing for apolipoprotein A1 (APOL1) high–risk alleles.

This patient presents with FSGS (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis) not otherwise specified, which is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in African Americans. APOL1 high-risk alleles are associated with an increased risk of FSGS and other kidney diseases in individuals of African descent. Testing for APOL1 high-risk alleles can help identify genetic susceptibility to kidney disease and inform treatment decisions.

The other options are not as relevant at this stage:

A. Serum soluble urokinase–type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) level may be elevated in some cases of FSGS, but it is not a specific diagnostic test and is not a priority at this time.

C. Genetic testing for an NPHS2 gene mutation is more relevant for steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, which is not the primary concern in this case.

D. Genetic testing for polymorphisms of the angiotensin–converting enzyme (ACE) gene is not directly related to FSGS or nephrotic syndrome.

E. While no additional diagnostic studies may be required for some patients, in this case, genetic testing for APOL1 high-risk alleles is a relevant next step to further understand the patient's condition and guide treatment.",Success
Which of the following statements is most accurate?,D,"The correct answer is A. There is little utility to screening by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) because she likely has renal osteodystrophy, and DXA would not be sufficiently predictive of fracture risk.

This patient has a history of lupus nephritis and stage 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD), which increases her risk of developing renal osteodystrophy, a type of bone disease that can affect bone density and quality. DXA, which is commonly used to screen for osteoporosis, may not accurately predict fracture risk in patients with renal osteodystrophy. This is because DXA measures bone density, but renal osteodystrophy can affect bone quality and architecture, making it more prone to fractures even with normal or near-normal bone density.

The other options are not accurate:

B. While it is true that some osteoporosis treatments may be contraindicated or require dose adjustments in patients with reduced eGFR, this does not mean that screening for osteoporosis is not useful. In fact, identifying osteoporosis in patients with CKD may help guide treatment decisions and prevent fractures.

C. Lupus can cause arthritis, but this does not necessarily affect the accuracy of bone density measurements. DXA is a reliable method for measuring bone density, even in patients with arthritis.

D. While regular screening for osteoporosis may be recommended for certain populations, such as postmenopausal women or individuals with a high risk of osteoporosis, the frequency of screening (every 12 to 24 months) is not necessarily applicable to this patient. Given her history of CKD and lupus nephritis, a more individualized approach to screening and management may be necessary.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements about pre-transplantation cardiovascular screening tests for this patient is most CORRECT?,C,"The correct answer is C. Most transplantation programs submit transplantation candidates to a rigorous cardiovascular evaluation, although the evidence basis for this approach is lacking.

According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the American Heart Association (AHA), patients with type 1 diabetes and ESRD, like this patient, are at high risk for cardiovascular disease. However, there is no consensus on the optimal cardiovascular screening strategy for kidney transplant candidates.

While some programs may perform extensive cardiovascular evaluations, including left and right heart catheterization, exercise treadmill stress tests, and cardiac positron emission tomography myocardial perfusion imaging, the evidence basis for these approaches is limited. The American Society of Transplantation recommends a thorough cardiovascular evaluation, but the specific tests and procedures are not well-defined.

Therefore, option C is the most correct statement, as it acknowledges the variability in cardiovascular screening practices among transplantation programs, despite the lack of strong evidence supporting these approaches.",Success
Which of the following should you tell your colleague about risk of cardiovascular disease in young newly diagnosed hypertensive patients?,A,"The correct answer is A. Patients with BP of ≥ 130/80 mmHg before the age of 40 years are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

According to the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, hypertension is defined as a blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 130/80 mmHg. Research has shown that hypertension in young adults (< 40 years old) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life.

Studies have consistently demonstrated that hypertension in early adulthood is a strong predictor of CVD events, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure. This is because hypertension can lead to endothelial dysfunction, vascular remodeling, and cardiac remodeling, which can increase the risk of CVD over time.

In fact, a study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found that young adults with hypertension had a higher risk of CVD events compared to those without hypertension, even after adjusting for other cardiovascular risk factors.

Therefore, it is essential to educate young patients with hypertension about their increased risk of CVD and encourage them to adopt lifestyle modifications, such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and stress management, to reduce their risk. Additionally, pharmacological therapy may be necessary in some cases to control blood pressure and reduce the risk of CVD complications.

It's important to note that options B, C, and D are incorrect, as the evidence suggests that young adults with hypertension, regardless of gender, are at increased risk of CVD.",Success
Which ONE of the following treatment is supported by current evidence?,B,"The correct answer is B. Dapagliflozin 10 mg/d.

The patient is concerned about delaying the progression of kidney disease and reducing the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, has been shown to slow the progression of kidney disease and reduce the risk of ESKD in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

The DAPA-CKD trial, a randomized controlled trial, demonstrated that dapagliflozin 10 mg/d reduced the risk of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD, including those with IgA nephropathy. The trial results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2020 and have been incorporated into current clinical practice guidelines.

Atrasentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist, has been studied in patients with CKD, but its efficacy in reducing the risk of ESKD is not as well established as dapagliflozin.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, is primarily used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and has been shown to have cardiovascular benefits. While it may have some renal benefits, its role in CKD treatment is not as well established as dapagliflozin.

Finerenone, a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, has been studied in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes, but its efficacy in reducing the risk of ESKD is not as well established as dapagliflozin.

Therefore, based on current evidence, dapagliflozin 10 mg/d is the most supported treatment option for this patient.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements regarding anemia management in non-dialysis-dependent CKD is true?,C,"The correct answer is C. In randomized controlled studies, vadadustat and daprodustat were noninferior to darbepoetin in achieving a mean change in hemoglobin from baseline to end of study.

This option is supported by evidence from clinical trials. Vadadustat and daprodustat are oral hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) that have been studied as potential treatments for anemia in non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD). In randomized controlled trials, both vadadustat and daprodustat have been shown to be noninferior to darbepoetin (an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent) in achieving a mean change in hemoglobin from baseline to the end of the study.

Option A is incorrect because HIF-PHIs actually lead to a decrease in hepcidin, not an increase. Hepcidin is a protein that regulates iron metabolism, and high levels of hepcidin can contribute to anemia in CKD. HIF-PHIs work by inhibiting the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor, which leads to increased erythropoiesis and reduced hepcidin levels.

Option B is incorrect because while HIF-PHIs do lead to a decrease in hepcidin, they also lead to an increase in transferrin saturation and total iron-binding capacity, not a decrease.

Option D is incorrect because while vadadustat was noninferior to darbepoetin alpha in terms of major adverse cardiovascular events, this is not the correct answer to the question about anemia management in non-dialysis-dependent CKD.",Success
"Based on the clinical presentation, what would be the most likely histologic diagnosis if the patient underwent kidney biopsy?",A,"Based on the clinical presentation, the most likely histologic diagnosis if the patient underwent kidney biopsy would be:

A. Light chain proximal tubulopathy

Here's why:

* The patient has a history of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) with kappa-restricted plasma cells, which suggests the possibility of a plasma cell disorder affecting the kidneys.
* The presence of glycosuria with normoglycemia is a key finding, as it suggests that the kidneys are having difficulty reabsorbing glucose, which is a characteristic feature of light chain proximal tubulopathy.
* The patient's slowly progressive CKD and recent serum creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL also support this diagnosis.
* Light chain proximal tubulopathy is a rare condition in which light chains produced by plasma cells are toxic to proximal tubular cells, leading to tubular dysfunction and CKD.
* While the other options (B, C, and D) are also related to plasma cell disorders, they do not specifically explain the presence of glycosuria with normoglycemia, which is a distinctive feature of light chain proximal tubulopathy.

It's essential to note that a kidney biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of CKD.",Success
Which of the following is true?,B,"The correct answer is B. Observational data suggest that working > 48 hours weekly is associated with increased risk of hypertension compared with working < 35 hours weekly.

Let me explain:

* Option A is incorrect because while moderate alcohol consumption may have some cardiovascular benefits, the evidence is not conclusive, and the American Heart Association recommends that people who drink do so in moderation (up to 1 drink per day for women and up to 2 drinks per day for men). Excessive alcohol consumption can actually increase blood pressure.
* Option C is incorrect because while working long hours may be associated with masked hypertension (elevated blood pressure only in a clinical setting), studies have shown that working long hours is also associated with an increased risk of sustained hypertension.
* Option D is incorrect because while genetic studies can provide insights into the relationship between alcohol intake and hypertension, the evidence from these studies is not yet conclusive, and more research is needed to fully understand the relationship.

Regarding the relationship between working long hours and hypertension, a 2015 meta-analysis published in The Lancet found that working 49 hours or more per week was associated with an increased risk of hypertension compared with working 35-40 hours per week. This association was found to be strongest in men.

It's essential to address lifestyle factors, including work-life balance, physical activity, and alcohol consumption, as part of a comprehensive approach to managing hypertension. By encouraging the patient to make positive changes, such as reducing work hours, increasing physical activity, and moderating alcohol intake, we can help him reduce his blood pressure and overall cardiovascular risk.",Success
Which ONE of the following would be the BEST way to treat this relapse?,B,"The correct answer is C. Add tacrolimus to corticosteroids.

The patient has a history of cyclophosphamide treatment and has reached a cumulative dose of 20 g, which increases the risk of infertility and malignancy. Given the patient's intolerance to mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolate sodium, adding more cyclophosphamide (options A and B) is not a suitable option.

Tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in treating lupus nephritis, particularly in patients who are intolerant to mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolate sodium. It is a reasonable alternative to add to corticosteroids in this patient.

Abatacept, a selective T-cell co-stimulation modulator, is not typically used as a first-line treatment for lupus nephritis, and there is limited evidence to support its use in this context.

It's essential to consider the patient's medical history, including the cumulative cyclophosphamide dose and previous treatment regimens, when making treatment decisions. In this case, adding tacrolimus to corticosteroids is the best option.",Success
Which ONE of the following diets should you tell him is associated with the lowest risk of CKD progression?,D,"Based on current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices, the correct answer is:

C. A Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-style diet that restricts red and processed meat

The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is a well-established eating plan that has been shown to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The DASH diet emphasizes whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products, while restricting red and processed meat. This diet has been associated with a lower risk of CKD progression due to its ability to reduce blood pressure, improve insulin sensitivity, and decrease inflammation.

The other options are not supported by evidence as being associated with the lowest risk of CKD progression:

A. Very low-carbohydrate diets have not been consistently shown to slow CKD progression and may even be harmful in some cases.

B. A liberal protein diet (> 1.2 g/kg per day) may actually accelerate CKD progression, as high protein intake can increase glomerular pressure and damage.

D. A calorie-restricted diet (< 800 kcal/d) may be beneficial for weight loss, but there is limited evidence to support its role in slowing CKD progression.

It's essential to note that a comprehensive approach to managing CKD should include a combination of dietary modifications, lifestyle changes, and pharmacological interventions, as recommended by the patient's healthcare provider.",Success
"In addition to ongoing close follow-up of this man’s kidney function, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?",A,"The correct answer is A. Perform a kidney allograft biopsy.

The patient's recent increase in creatinine level, presence of a new donor-specific antibody (DSA), and decreased tacrolimus trough level suggest possible acute rejection or antibody-mediated rejection. The absence of proteinuria, hematuria, and hydronephrosis on ultrasound does not rule out rejection.

A kidney allograft biopsy is the most appropriate next step to determine the cause of the increased creatinine level and to assess for any signs of rejection. The biopsy will provide a definitive diagnosis and guide further management.

Option B, assessing for donor-derived cell-free DNA, may be useful in monitoring for rejection, but it is not a substitute for a biopsy in this scenario.

Option C, calculating the eplet mismatch score, is not relevant to the current situation, as it is used to predict the risk of antibody-mediated rejection before transplantation.

Option D, increasing tacrolimus, may be considered if the biopsy shows evidence of rejection, but it is not the most appropriate initial step. The current tacrolimus trough level is within the therapeutic range, and increasing the dose without a clear diagnosis may lead to over-immunosuppression.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements is correct concerning transcatheter aortic valve replacement and AKI?,C,"The correct answer is D. Increased length of stay was observed in AKI patients; however, long-term follow-up demonstrated similar 7-year mortality in AKI versus non-AKI patients.

Explanation:

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a minimally invasive procedure that carries a risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). Studies have shown that AKI occurs in approximately 15-30% of patients undergoing TAVR, which contradicts option A.

Option B is partially correct, as the volume of iodinated contrast media used during the procedure is a risk factor for AKI. However, it is not the only factor, and other variables such as age, pre-existing kidney disease, and hemodynamic instability also play a role.

Option C is incorrect, as studies have shown that most patients with AKI after TAVR recover kidney function within 30 days.

Option E is also incorrect, as AKI stage 1 is more common than stages 2 and 3 in patients undergoing TAVR.

Option D is correct, as studies have demonstrated that AKI is associated with increased length of stay and healthcare costs. However, long-term follow-up has shown similar mortality rates between patients with and without AKI after TAVR.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell her about simultaneous pancreas kidney (SPK) transplantation?,D,"The correct answer is B. SPK transplant is associated with substantial improvements in health-related quality of life, even in the setting of early pancreas transplant failure.

This patient is a suitable candidate for simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation, given her type 1 diabetes, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and lack of potential living kidney donors. Her well-controlled blood sugar levels, absence of symptomatic cardiovascular disease, and low C-peptide level (< 2 ng/ml) further support her candidacy.

Option B is correct because SPK transplantation has been shown to improve health-related quality of life, even if the pancreas transplant fails early on. This is likely due to the benefits of kidney transplantation alone, as well as the potential for improved glycemic control and reduced hypoglycemic episodes.

Option A is incorrect because the patient is a suitable candidate for SPK transplantation. Option C is also incorrect, as while SPK transplantation may offer some survival benefits, the evidence is not conclusive, and it is not a guarantee of improved long-term survival compared to kidney transplant alone. Option D is incorrect because the waiting time for SPK transplantation is often longer than for deceased donor kidney transplant alone, due to the need for a matching pancreas and kidney from the same donor.",Success
"In addition to standard precautions, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?",D,"The correct answer is B. Cover the lesions and administer dialysis at the outpatient facility in an isolation room under contact precautions.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) reactivation, also known as shingles. The unilateral distribution of the rash, involving the chest, abdomen, and thighs, and the presence of vesicles, pustules, and scabs in various stages of eruption, support this diagnosis.

Given the patient's immunocompromised state due to chronic kidney disease and prednisone use, it is essential to take precautions to prevent the transmission of VZV to other patients and healthcare workers. Contact precautions are necessary to prevent direct contact with the patient's skin lesions, which can spread the virus.

Administering dialysis in an isolation room at the outpatient facility, while covering the lesions, is the most appropriate management. This approach balances the need to provide necessary medical care while minimizing the risk of transmission.

Option A is incorrect because it does not take into account the need for contact precautions. Option C is unnecessary, as the patient can be managed safely at the outpatient facility with proper precautions. Option D is also incorrect, as airborne precautions are not necessary for VZV, and immediate hospitalization is not required unless the patient's condition deteriorates or complications arise.",Success
Which ONE of the following would you recommend as the BEST strategy to reduce the overall cost of care for patients with ESRD?,C,"Based on evidence-based practices and current medical guidelines, I would recommend option C: Referral to nephrologists when patients are anticipated to require renal replacement therapy (RRT) at least 1 year in advance.

Early referral to a nephrologist has been shown to improve patient outcomes, reduce hospitalizations, and decrease costs associated with ESRD care. Studies have demonstrated that timely referral to a nephrologist can:

1. Delay the need for dialysis initiation, reducing the likelihood of urgent starts and associated complications.
2. Increase the use of home dialysis modalities, which are often more cost-effective than in-center hemodialysis.
3. Improve patient education and preparation for RRT, leading to better health outcomes and reduced hospitalizations.
4. Enhance coordination of care, reducing unnecessary tests, procedures, and hospitalizations.

The other options, while important, may not have as direct an impact on reducing the overall cost of care for patients with ESRD:

A. Increasing organ procurement through opt-out donation policies may improve access to transplantation, but it may not directly reduce costs associated with ESRD care.

B. Increasing the utilization of home-suitable dialysis modalities is important, but it may not address the broader issue of delayed referral to nephrologists and the associated costs.

D. Providing financial incentives to care providers for achieving laboratory goals before dialysis initiation may improve quality of care, but it may not have a direct impact on reducing costs.

By recommending early referral to nephrologists, we can improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, and enhance the overall value of care for patients with ESRD.",Success
Which of the following is true regarding salt-sensitive hypertension?,B,"The correct answer is B. High-salt diet promotes the development of Th17 cells, which upregulate renal sodium reabsorption.

Salt-sensitive hypertension is a condition where blood pressure increases in response to high sodium intake. Research has shown that a high-salt diet can promote the development of Th17 cells, a type of immune cell that contributes to inflammation and immune responses. In the context of hypertension, Th17 cells have been found to upregulate renal sodium reabsorption, leading to increased blood pressure.

The other options are incorrect:

A. Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, is actually more effective than losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, in reducing blood pressure in salt-sensitive hypertension models.

C. Increased dietary potassium intake has been shown to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients with high salt intake, as potassium helps to counterbalance the effects of sodium on blood pressure.

D. SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibition, which is used to treat type 2 diabetes, has been found to decrease glomerular capillary pressure and increase GFR (glomerular filtration rate) in some studies, rather than causing an acute decrease in GFR.

It's worth noting that the patient's high-salt diet and processed food intake are likely contributing to his uncontrolled hypertension, and lifestyle modifications, such as reducing sodium intake and increasing potassium-rich foods, should be encouraged to help achieve better blood pressure control.",Success
Which ONE of the following dialysis strategies is MOST appropriate for this woman?,D,"The correct answer is D. Hemodialysis totaling greater than or equal to 36 hours/week.

According to the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) and the National Kidney Foundation (NKF), pregnant women with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) require more intensive dialysis to optimize fetal outcomes. The recommended dialysis strategy for pregnant women with ESRD is to increase the frequency and duration of dialysis sessions to achieve a minimum of 36 hours of dialysis per week.

This is because pregnancy increases the demand for solute removal, and inadequate dialysis can lead to complications such as fetal growth restriction, preterm labor, and maternal morbidity. The goal is to maintain a high level of small solute clearance, as measured by the equilibrated Kt/V, to ensure optimal fetal outcomes.

In this case, the patient's current dialysis regimen of 12 hours/week (thrice weekly for 4 hours) is insufficient to meet the increased demands of pregnancy. Increasing the dialysis time to at least 36 hours/week will help to optimize fetal outcomes and reduce the risk of complications.

Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not provide sufficient dialysis time to meet the increased demands of pregnancy.",Success
Which ONE of the following criteria would MOST favor tapering of this patient’s immunosuppression?,B,"The correct answer is B. A sustained remission for at least 24 months.

The patient has achieved a complete renal remission after 1 year of overall therapy and has not had relapses, which suggests that she has been in remission for at least 24 months. This prolonged period of remission is a strong indication to consider tapering her immunosuppression. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommends tapering immunosuppressive therapy in patients with lupus nephritis who have achieved a sustained remission for at least 2 years.

Option A, the absence of high-risk APOL1 risk alleles, may be relevant in assessing the patient's risk of kidney disease progression, but it is not a primary criterion for tapering immunosuppression.

Option C, a high number of CD81 T cells in her urine, is not a established biomarker for lupus nephritis remission or tapering immunosuppression.

Option D, the absence of C3b autoantibodies, may be relevant in assessing the patient's immune response, but it is not a specific criterion for tapering immunosuppression in lupus nephritis.

It's important to note that tapering immunosuppression should be done gradually and under close monitoring to avoid relapse. The decision to taper should be individualized and based on the patient's overall clinical response, laboratory results, and other factors.",Success
"In addition to strict adherence to standard infection control practices, which ONE of the following additional infection control measures should you recommend for this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Dialyze the patient at a station with as few adjacent stations as possible.

Since the isolation room is not available, it's essential to minimize the risk of transmission to other patients and staff. Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA) is a highly infectious and resistant bacterium. To reduce the risk of transmission, it's recommended to dialyze the patient at a station with as few adjacent stations as possible. This will help to minimize the exposure of other patients and staff to the patient's VRSA infection.

Option B is not necessary, as the patient has already received 1 week of antibiotic therapy and is being discharged with a plan for outpatient parenteral anti-infective therapy. The patient does not require inpatient isolation until the completion of the antibiotic course.

Option C is incorrect because hand hygiene with soap and water is not sufficient for VRSA. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), hand hygiene with an alcohol-based hand rub is recommended for VRSA.

Option D is also incorrect because reusable gowns are not recommended for VRSA. The CDC recommends using disposable gowns, gloves, and masks when caring for patients with VRSA to prevent transmission.

It's essential to follow strict adherence to standard infection control practices, including proper hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and proper cleaning and disinfection of equipment and surfaces.",Success
"According to the most recent data, what is the BEST approach to treating her hypertension?",B,"The correct answer is B. Stop the losartan and start labetalol.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, such as losartan, are contraindicated in pregnancy due to the risk of fetal renal damage and oligohydramnios. Labetalol is a recommended first-line antihypertensive medication in pregnancy, as it is effective and has a good safety profile.

The patient's blood pressure is not well controlled, and her history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) puts her at risk for preeclampsia and other complications. Stopping the losartan and switching to labetalol is the best approach to treat her hypertension during pregnancy.

Option A is incorrect because losartan is contraindicated in pregnancy. Option C is incorrect because adding another agent to target a blood pressure of <140/90 mm Hg is not the primary concern; rather, it is to switch to a safe and effective antihypertensive medication during pregnancy. Option D is incorrect because while calcium channel blockers are sometimes used in pregnancy, labetalol is a more recommended first-line agent.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell him about current recommendations regarding accessory veins in nonmaturing ﬁstulae?,C,"The correct answer is B. An accessory vein is usually pathologic and is the result of an alternative channel that develops to bypass a stenotic area.

According to current recommendations and evidence-based practices, accessory veins in nonmaturing fistulas are often pathologic and develop as an alternative channel to bypass a stenotic area. In this case, the large side-branch accessory vein is diverting a significant amount of outflow (30-40%) and is likely contributing to the nonmaturation of the fistula.

The KDOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) guidelines recommend that accessory veins be ligated or occluded if they are thought to be contributing to fistula nonmaturation. However, there is no specific percentage of outflow diversion that dictates ligation, as option C suggests.

Option A is incorrect because while accessory veins can contribute to nonmaturation, they do not always need to be ligated. Option D is also incorrect because while surgical ligation may be an option, endovascular coil placement is also a viable and often preferred approach, especially if the accessory vein is difficult to access surgically.",Success
Which ONE of the following interventions is MOST likely to improve this man’s cardiovascular outcomes?,B,"The correct answer is B. Smoking cessation.

This patient has multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Smoking is a significant modifiable risk factor that contributes to cardiovascular disease, and quitting smoking has been shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular risk.

The patient's current medications, including atorvastatin, are already addressing his hyperlipidemia. Adding niacin (Option A) may have some benefits, but it is not as critical as smoking cessation. Sodium bicarbonate (Option C) may be beneficial for patients with CKD and metabolic acidosis, but there is no indication of metabolic acidosis in this patient (total CO2 is 23 mmol/L, which is within normal range). Increasing atorvastatin (Option D) may not provide additional benefits, as the patient's LDL cholesterol is already well-controlled.

Smoking cessation is a crucial intervention that can significantly improve this patient's cardiovascular outcomes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), quitting smoking can lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular disease by 30-50%.",Success
Which of the following statements is true about DNAJB9-positive ﬁbrillary glomerulonephritis?,D,"The correct answer is C. Congo red staining is required to rule out AL (light chain) amyloidosis.

DNAJB9-positive fibrillary glomerulonephritis is a rare entity that can be challenging to diagnose. The presence of DNAJB9 positivity on immunohistochemical staining suggests fibrillary glomerulonephritis, but it is essential to rule out other possibilities, such as AL (light chain) amyloidosis. Congo red staining is a specific stain used to diagnose amyloidosis, and it is necessary to perform this stain to exclude AL amyloidosis.

Option A is incorrect because while some patients with DNAJB9-positive fibrillary glomerulonephritis may have an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder, it is not the majority.

Option B is incorrect because pronase digestion of paraffin-embedded tissue is not a standard procedure for evaluating immunoglobulin deposits in kidney biopsy specimens.

Option D is incorrect because DNAJB9-positive fibrillary glomerulonephritis can be associated with monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS), and therefore, a hematologic workup is recommended to evaluate for any underlying plasma cell dyscrasia or lymphoproliferative disorder.",Success
Which ONE of the following BEST depicts the changes in incident vascular access during this interval (2005–2014)?,D,"The correct answer is C. An increase in incident fistula rate and a decline in graft and catheter rate.

According to the Fistula First Breakthrough Initiative (FFBI) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), there was a significant increase in the use of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) as the preferred vascular access modality for incident hemodialysis patients in the United States between 2005 and 2014. This was accompanied by a decline in the use of grafts and catheters.

The FFBI, launched in 2003, aimed to increase the use of AVFs and reduce the use of catheters, which are associated with higher complication rates and mortality. The initiative promoted education, quality improvement, and payment incentives to encourage the use of AVFs.

Studies have shown that between 2005 and 2014, the incident AVF rate increased significantly, while the graft rate and catheter rate decreased. This change in practice pattern is attributed to the efforts of the FFBI and the adoption of evidence-based guidelines recommending AVFs as the preferred vascular access modality for hemodialysis patients.",Success
What is the most likely diagnosis?,A,"The correct answer is A. Denosumab-induced hypocalcemia.

The patient's symptoms of paresthesia and muscle cramps, along with the laboratory results showing a low serum calcium level of 7.0 mg/dL, suggest denosumab-induced hypocalcemia. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits RANKL, can cause hypocalcemia, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or vitamin D deficiency. The patient's history of kidney disease (AKI) and vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 12 ng/ml) increases the risk of denosumab-induced hypocalcemia.

Option B is unlikely, as the patient's kidney function has already been compromised due to AKI, and denosumab is not typically associated with worsening kidney function.

Option C is also unlikely, as denosumab is not typically associated with hyperphosphatemia. In fact, denosumab can cause hypophosphatemia due to its effect on osteoclasts.

Option D is unlikely, as ceftriaxone-induced interstitial nephritis would not typically cause hypocalcemia, and the patient's kidney function has already been compromised due to AKI.

It's essential to note that the patient's symptoms and laboratory results should be further evaluated and monitored to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of hypocalcemia.",Success
"He is currently taking losartan 50 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily, and amlodipine 2.5 mg at 1
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. Switch to triple combination therapy to improve BP control and compliance.

Rationale:

The patient has variable BP control and issues with compliance, which suggests that simplifying his medication regimen could improve adherence. Triple combination therapy, which combines an angiotensin receptor blocker (losartan), a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), and a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) in a single pill, has been shown to improve BP control and reduce cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension (1, 2). This approach can also improve compliance by reducing the number of pills the patient needs to take daily.

The other options are not as appropriate:

B. Increasing amlodipine to 5 mg daily may not address the patient's compliance issues and may not provide adequate BP control.

C. Adding spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic, may be beneficial for BP control, but it may not address the patient's compliance issues and may increase the risk of hyperkalemia.

D. Adding carvedilol, a beta blocker, may be beneficial for BP control, but it may not address the patient's compliance issues and may have additional side effects.

E. No change in therapy is not a suitable option, as the patient's BP control is variable, and compliance issues need to be addressed.

"In addition to ongoing assessment of this woman’s serum electrolytes and kidney function, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Increase furosemide to 40 mg twice daily.

Rationale:

The patient's symptoms of orthopnea and dyspnea on exertion, along with physical examination findings of jugular venous pressure of 8 cm H2O, bibasilar crackles, and 2+ leg edema, suggest that she is still experiencing congestion despite initial weight loss with furosemide. The stable weight over the past week indicates that the initial diuretic effect has worn off, and further diuresis is needed.

Increasing the dose of furosemide to 80 mg daily (Option C) may be too aggressive, given the patient's stage 3a:A1 CKD and recent increase in creatinine level. This could exacerbate kidney function decline.

Discontinuing furosemide (Option A) or lisinopril (Option B) is not appropriate, as these medications are essential for managing the patient's heart failure and hypertension.

Increasing the frequency of furosemide administration to 40 mg twice daily (Option D) is a more reasonable approach, as it can help maintain a more consistent diuretic effect without significantly increasing the total daily dose. This is a common strategy in patients with heart failure who require ongoing diuresis.

It is essential to continue monitoring the patient's serum electrolytes, kidney function, and overall clinical response to adjust the treatment plan accordingly.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you recommend?,C,"The correct answer is C. Avoid nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs and proton pump inhibitors.

Pembrolizumab, a checkpoint inhibitor, can cause immune-related adverse events, including nephritis and acute kidney injury. Although the patient has no history of kidney disease and normal kidney function, it's essential to take preventive measures to minimize the risk of kidney injury.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can both increase the risk of kidney injury, especially when used concomitantly with pembrolizumab. NSAIDs can cause acute kidney injury, and PPIs have been associated with an increased risk of acute interstitial nephritis.

Therefore, recommending that the patient avoid using NSAIDs and PPIs during pembrolizumab treatment is a prudent measure to reduce the risk of kidney problems.

Serologic testing for lupus (Option A) is not relevant in this scenario, as there is no indication of autoimmune disease. Hemoglobin A1c and fasting glucose level (Option B) may be relevant for patients with diabetes, but it's not directly related to the risk of kidney injury with pembrolizumab. Beginning a low-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (Option D) may be beneficial for patients with hypertension or kidney disease, but it's not a specific recommendation for this patient.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements about cognitive function and MRI data in CKD is CORRECT?,B,"The correct answer is B. Both higher UACR and lower eGFR are associated with abnormal white matter volume.

Research has shown that individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. Studies have found that both albuminuria (as measured by urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, UACR) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) are associated with abnormal white matter volume on MRI, which is a marker of cerebral small vessel disease.

A 2019 study published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology found that higher UACR and lower eGFR were independently associated with greater white matter hyperintensity volume, which is a measure of abnormal white matter volume. Another study published in 2018 in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology found similar results, showing that both albuminuria and reduced eGFR were associated with increased white matter hyperintensity volume.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because while albuminuria and lower eGFR are associated with cognitive impairment, the specific relationships described in these options are not accurate.",Success
"With regard to the pathophysiology of FSGS, which of the following is correct?",C,"The correct answer is C. In secondary FSGS, glomerular hypertension causes podocyte injury, leading to podocyte detachment and loss.

Explanation:

Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a histologic pattern of injury that can result from various pathophysiologic processes. The pathophysiology of FSGS involves podocyte injury and loss, leading to glomerular scarring.

In secondary FSGS, which accounts for approximately 50% of cases, the underlying cause is often related to glomerular hypertension, which leads to podocyte injury, detachment, and loss. This can occur in the context of chronic kidney disease, reflux nephropathy, or other conditions that cause glomerular hyperfiltration.

Option A is incorrect because the variant of FSGS lesion seen on light microscopy (as described in the Columbia classification) is not helpful in differentiating between primary and genetic forms of FSGS.

Option B is incorrect because abnormalities in genes encoding glomerular basement membrane (GBM) collagen are associated with Alport syndrome, not primary FSGS.

Option D is incorrect because the degree of foot process effacement seen on electron microscopy is not used to differentiate between primary and genetic FSGS. Foot process effacement is a nonspecific finding that can be seen in various glomerular diseases, including FSGS.",Success
Which ONE of the following would be the BEST advice for this patient?,C,"The correct answer is C. Kidney prognosis is likely to be good long term, but uncertainty exists; therefore, yearly follow-up is advisable.

Thin basement membrane disease (TBMD) is a benign condition characterized by diffuse thinning of the glomerular basement membrane. It is a common cause of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, especially in young adults. The patient's normal eGFR, BP, and lack of significant proteinuria (185 mg/24 hours) suggest a good prognosis.

However, the patient's history of hematuria since childhood and the family history of possible hematuria in his father raise some uncertainty about the long-term outcome. While the prognosis is likely to be good, yearly follow-up is advisable to monitor for any potential progression or development of complications.

Option A is incorrect because, although the prognosis is generally good, there is still some uncertainty, and regular follow-up is necessary. Option B is not indicated, as ACE inhibitors are typically used to reduce proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease, which is not the case here. Option D is not necessary, as genetic testing is not typically recommended for TBMD, and a molecular diagnosis would not change the management or prognosis in this case.",Success
"In addition to usual nonpharmacologic measures, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate treatment recommendation to improve his orthostatic hypotension?",A,"The correct answer is A. Droxidopa.

This patient has multiple system atrophy, a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the autonomic nervous system, leading to orthostatic hypotension. The patient has already tried fludrocortisone, which worsened supine hypertension, and midodrine, which caused adverse effects. 

Droxidopa is a synthetic amino acid that is converted to norepinephrine in the brain and peripheral nervous system, increasing blood pressure. It is specifically approved for the treatment of orthostatic dizziness or lightheadedness in adults with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, which is consistent with this patient's condition. Studies have shown that droxidopa can improve orthostatic tolerance and reduce symptoms of orthostatic hypotension in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension.

Pyridostigmine (option B) is a cholinesterase inhibitor that can increase acetylcholine levels, which may help improve orthostatic tolerance. However, its effectiveness in this patient population is less established compared to droxidopa.

Clonidine (option C) is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that can decrease blood pressure, which would worsen this patient's orthostatic hypotension.

Erythropoietin (option D) is a medication used to treat anemia, which is not relevant to this patient's condition.

A caffeinated beverage with each meal (option E) may provide some temporary benefit by increasing blood pressure, but it is not a reliable or sustainable treatment for orthostatic hypotension.

In addition to pharmacological treatment, nonpharmacologic measures such as increasing fluid and salt intake, avoiding dehydration, and using compression stockings should be continued to help manage orthostatic hypotension.",Success
What is the BEST next step to evaluate for pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma in this patient?,A,"The correct answer is B. CT scan of the adrenal glands.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as periodic episodes of headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis, are suggestive of a pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. The elevated normetanephrine level in the plasma free metanephrines test supports this suspicion. Normetanephrine is a metabolite of norepinephrine, and elevated levels can indicate the presence of a catecholamine-secreting tumor.

Given the abnormal normetanephrine level, the next step is to localize the tumor. A CT scan of the adrenal glands is the best initial imaging modality to evaluate for a pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma. This is because most pheochromocytomas arise from the adrenal medulla, and a CT scan can help identify any adrenal masses or abnormalities.

Repeating the plasma free metanephrines test (Option A) may not provide additional information, as the initial test has already indicated an abnormality. MIBG scintigraphy (Option C) is a functional imaging study that can help identify the tumor, but it is typically used after an anatomical imaging study like CT or MRI has identified a lesion. Clonidine suppression testing (Option D) is a pharmacological test that can help confirm the diagnosis, but it is not the next best step in this scenario.

According to the Endocrine Society's clinical practice guidelines, ""Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, should be performed to localize the tumor in patients with biochemical evidence of a pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma.""",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate treatment?,C,"The correct answer is C. Ketoconazole.

This patient's laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH), a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by hypercalcemia, hypocalciuria, and normal or low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The patient's serum calcium level is elevated, but his PTH level is suppressed, which is consistent with FHH. The elevated 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D level and undetectable 24,25-dihydroxy vitamin D level also support this diagnosis.

Ketoconazole, an antifungal medication, has been shown to be effective in reducing serum calcium levels in patients with FHH by inhibiting the production of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D. This is the most appropriate treatment option for this patient.

Calcitonin (A) and zoledronic acid (B) are used to treat hypercalcemia, but they are not specific to FHH and may not address the underlying pathophysiology. Prednisone (D) is not indicated for FHH. Parathyroidectomy (E) is not necessary, as the patient's PTH level is suppressed, indicating that the parathyroid glands are not overactive.

It's important to note that the patient's history of recurrent nephrolithiasis is likely related to his underlying FHH, and treatment with ketoconazole may help reduce his risk of future stone formation.",Success
Which ONE of the following treatments would you choose now?,A,"Based on the patient's presentation and genetic diagnosis, I would choose option B: Prednisone at 1 mg/kg per day for 16 weeks.

The patient has a pathogenic mutation in transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC6), which is associated with familial FSGS. Despite the ACEI treatment, the patient's proteinuria remains significant at 3.5 g/d. In this scenario, a trial of corticosteroids is a reasonable next step.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend a 16-week course of corticosteroids for patients with FSGS and nephrotic-range proteinuria. Prednisone at 1 mg/kg per day is a common dosing regimen for this indication.

While calcineurin inhibitors (option A) and cyclophosphamide (option C) may be used in certain cases of FSGS, they are typically reserved for more severe or resistant cases. Mycophenolate mofetil (option D) is not typically used as a first-line agent for FSGS.

It's essential to note that the patient's family history and genetic diagnosis suggest a strong likelihood of a genetic cause for the FSGS, which may impact the response to treatment. Close monitoring of the patient's response to therapy and consideration of further genetic counseling may be necessary.",Success
"Based on the current Banff classiﬁcation, how should her rejection be classiﬁed?",C,"Based on the current Banff classification, the correct answer is:

B. Chronic active antibody-mediated rejection

Here's why:

* The presence of donor-specific antibodies (DSA) indicates an antibody-mediated response.
* The biopsy findings of interstitial inflammation involving > 25% of the sclerotic parenchyma and > 25% of the total cortical parenchyma, along with moderate tubulitis, are consistent with chronic active antibody-mediated rejection.
* The Banff classification defines chronic active antibody-mediated rejection as the presence of DSA, C4d deposition, and/or microvascular inflammation, along with evidence of chronic tissue injury (in this case, fibrosis of 20% of the cortex).
* The presence of fibrosis and inflammation in areas of scarred cortex does not rule out rejection, as chronic rejection can occur in areas of previous injury.

The other options are not correct:

* A. Grade IA active T cell–mediated rejection is not correct because the presence of DSA and chronic tissue injury (fibrosis) suggests an antibody-mediated response rather than a pure T cell–mediated response.
* C. Grade 1A chronic active T cell-mediated rejection is not correct because the presence of DSA and microvascular inflammation suggests an antibody-mediated response rather than a pure T cell–mediated response.
* D. No rejection because there is inflammation in areas of scarred cortex is not correct because the presence of inflammation and fibrosis in areas of previous injury is consistent with chronic rejection.",Success
Which of the following best describes the components of the AHA’s DASH diet that would be beneﬁcial in combating the gradual increase of BP in this patient?,A,"The correct answer is none of the above. The options provided are related to renal physiology and do not accurately describe the components of the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet.

The DASH diet is a well-established eating plan that is recommended by the American Heart Association (AHA) to help manage blood pressure. The key components of the DASH diet that would be beneficial in combating the gradual increase of BP in this patient include:

* Emphasizing whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and low-fat dairy products
* Including a variety of potassium-rich foods, such as bananas, leafy greens, and sweet potatoes
* Increasing calcium and fiber intake
* Reducing sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day
* Limiting saturated and total fat, as well as cholesterol

The DASH diet has been shown to be effective in reducing blood pressure and improving cardiovascular health. It is a balanced and sustainable eating plan that can be adapted to individual preferences and lifestyles.",Success
All of the following support gestational hypertension rather than preeclampsia EXCEPT:,B,"The correct answer is: None of the above.

All the options provided support the diagnosis of gestational hypertension rather than preeclampsia.

A. Absence of increased proteinuria: Preeclampsia is typically characterized by proteinuria (>300 mg/24 hours or a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥0.3), which is absent in this case.

B. Onset of hypertension after 20 weeks' gestation: Gestational hypertension typically develops after 20 weeks' gestation, whereas preeclampsia can occur at any time during pregnancy.

C. Normal serum creatinine, platelet count, and liver function tests: These normal laboratory results suggest that there is no evidence of end-organ damage, which is often seen in preeclampsia.

D. Normal values and ratios of angiogenic markers, fms-like tyrosine kinase and placental growth factor: These markers are often abnormal in preeclampsia, but in this case, they are within normal ranges for gestational age, supporting a diagnosis of gestational hypertension.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), gestational hypertension is defined as new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks' gestation without proteinuria or other signs of preeclampsia. The patient's presentation, laboratory results, and absence of proteinuria and other signs of preeclampsia support a diagnosis of gestational hypertension.",Success
"Which ONE of the following is TRUE regarding the pharmacokinetics of LCPT compared with immediate release, twice-daily tacrolimus?",D,"The correct answer is A. Lower C maximum (peak concentration) and lower AUC (area under the curve, total exposure).

LCPT (once-daily prolonged-release tacrolimus) is designed to provide a more consistent and sustained release of tacrolimus over a 24-hour period, compared to immediate-release tacrolimus. This results in a lower peak concentration (Cmax) and a lower total exposure (AUC) compared to immediate-release tacrolimus.

Studies have shown that LCPT has a lower Cmax and AUC compared to immediate-release tacrolimus, which can lead to a more stable and predictable pharmacokinetic profile. This can result in improved tolerability and reduced side effects, such as insomnia, tremor, and headaches, which the patient is experiencing.

It's worth noting that the dose of LCPT is typically lower than the total daily dose of immediate-release tacrolimus, which is why the patient's dose is being reduced to 6 mg daily.",Success
Prescription of which ONE of the following medication combinations is associated with the GREATEST risk for hospitalization with AKI over the next month?,D,"The correct answer is B. Amlodipine and clarithromycin.

This patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is at risk for acute kidney injury (AKI). The combination of a dihydropyridine calcium blocker (amlodipine) and a macrolide antibiotic (clarithromycin) is associated with the greatest risk for hospitalization with AKI.

Clarithromycin is known to inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme, which can increase the levels of calcium channel blockers, such as amlodipine. This can lead to increased risk of AKI, particularly in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.

Azithromycin, on the other hand, is less likely to interact with calcium channel blockers and has a lower risk of AKI.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, the combination of a calcium channel blocker and a macrolide antibiotic, such as clarithromycin, should be used with caution in patients with CKD, as it may increase the risk of AKI.

Therefore, option B, Amlodipine and clarithromycin, is associated with the greatest risk for hospitalization with AKI over the next month.",Success
"In addition to continued losartan, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management of the increased albuminuria?",B,"The correct answer is D. Lisinopril 5 mg daily.

The patient's worsening albuminuria despite being on losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), suggests that additional therapy is needed to reduce proteinuria. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend combining an ARB with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or a direct renin inhibitor to further reduce proteinuria in patients with CKD and diabetes.

Lisinopril, an ACEi, is a suitable addition to the patient's current regimen. The combination of losartan and lisinopril can help reduce albuminuria and slow the progression of CKD.

Option A, cholecalciferol (vitamin D), is not directly related to managing albuminuria. While the patient's 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is slightly low, vitamin D supplementation is not the primary concern in this scenario.

Option B, a 2-gram sodium-restricted diet, is important for managing hypertension and CKD, but it is not the most direct intervention for reducing albuminuria.

Option C, paricalcitol, is a vitamin D analogue used to manage secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD. While the patient's parathyroid hormone level is slightly elevated, this is not the primary concern in this scenario, and paricalcitol is not a direct treatment for albuminuria.",Success
Detection of an abnormality in which ONE of the following is MOST likely to predict her risk for recurrent AFLP?,B,"The correct answer is B. Long–chain 3-hydroxyl CoA dehydrogenase.

Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) is a rare but life-threatening condition that occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy. It is often associated with a deficiency of long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD), an enzyme involved in fatty acid oxidation.

Studies have shown that women who have had AFLP are at increased risk of recurrent AFLP in subsequent pregnancies, particularly if they have a underlying LCHAD deficiency. Detection of an abnormality in LCHAD activity is therefore most likely to predict her risk for recurrent AFLP.

The other options are not directly related to AFLP or its recurrence:

A. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13) is involved in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, not AFLP.

C. Factor H is a complement regulatory protein, and its deficiency is associated with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, not AFLP.

D. Multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein 3 is involved in multidrug resistance, not AFLP.

E. Palmitoyltransferase 1 deficiency is associated with a different fatty acid oxidation disorder, not AFLP.

It's essential to note that genetic testing and counseling are recommended for women who have had AFLP, as they may be at risk of having a child with a fatty acid oxidation disorder.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell her about the signiﬁcance of the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and its measurement?,D,"The correct answer is D. A fourfold increase in the albumin-to-creatinine ratio may indicate a higher risk of ESRD.

The albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) is a measure of proteinuria, which is a key indicator of kidney damage. A fourfold increase in ACR over 3 years suggests worsening proteinuria, which is associated with a higher risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This is supported by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, which state that a rapid increase in ACR is a strong predictor of ESRD.

Option A is incorrect because declines in ACR are indeed associated with a reduced risk of ESRD.

Option B is incorrect because the recommended frequency of ACR measurement varies depending on the individual patient's situation, but it is not necessarily every 3 months.

Option C is incorrect because progression of CKD is clinically categorized by changes in both glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria, not just changes in ACR.",Success
Which ONE of the following is MOST likely to result from a change to hemodiaﬁltration in this patient?,C,"The correct answer is A. A reduction in his left ventricular mass.

Hemodiafiltration (HDF) is a type of dialysis that combines diffusive and convective clearance, which can provide better removal of middle molecules and phosphate compared to conventional hemodialysis. Studies have shown that HDF can lead to a reduction in left ventricular mass, which is a common complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a strong predictor of cardiovascular mortality.

The CONTRAST study, a randomized controlled trial, demonstrated that HDF significantly reduced left ventricular mass compared to low-flux hemodialysis. This is likely due to the improved phosphate removal and reduced inflammation associated with HDF.

While HDF may also have benefits on serum albumin concentration and systemic markers of inflammation, these effects are less well-established and may vary depending on the individual patient. There is no evidence to suggest that HDF would decrease quality of life.

In this patient, who has stable vascular access, adequate dialysis, and stable electrolytes, a change to HDF may be a reasonable consideration to improve his cardiovascular outcomes, particularly given his complaint of deteriorating exercise tolerance. However, a thorough discussion of the potential benefits and risks, as well as careful monitoring, would be necessary to ensure the best outcome for this patient.",Success
Which ONE of the following therapeutic agents is MOST likely responsible for AKI in this woman?,A,"The correct answer is A. Carfilzomib.

The patient's presentation with AKI, thrombocytopenia, and schistocytosis on peripheral blood smear suggests a diagnosis of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Carfilzomib, a proteasome inhibitor, is known to cause TMA, particularly in patients with multiple myeloma. The timing of the patient's symptoms, which started 2 weeks after transitioning to cyclophosphamide, carfilzomib, and dexamethasone, further supports carfilzomib as the likely culprit.

Lenalidomide (option B) is not typically associated with TMA, and the patient was previously on this medication without developing AKI. Melphalan (option C) is an alkylating agent that can cause nephrotoxicity, but it is less likely to cause TMA. Cyclophosphamide (option D) can cause hemorrhagic cystitis and nephrotoxicity, but it is not typically associated with TMA.

It's essential to note that the patient's ADAMTS13 activity is 82%, which is within the normal range, making thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) less likely. The presence of acanthocytes in the urinary sediment also supports a diagnosis of TMA rather than TTP.",Success
"In addition to discontinuing her current medi-cations and volume expansion with isotonic crystalloid, which ONE of the following is the next BEST step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Observation of clinical status after correction of hypovolemia.

The patient presents with hypovolemia, likely due to nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which has led to acute kidney injury (AKI) and metabolic acidosis. The laboratory results show a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (AGMA) with an elevated lactate level, suggesting that the acidosis is not solely due to the kidney injury.

The patient's medications, including metformin, irbesartan, and chlorthalidone, should be discontinued due to the risk of worsening kidney function and electrolyte imbalance.

The next step in management is to correct the hypovolemia with isotonic crystalloid and observe the patient's clinical status. This is because the patient's acid-base status and kidney function may improve with volume expansion and correction of electrolyte imbalances.

Option A is incorrect because obtaining a serum metformin level is not necessary at this point, as the medication has already been discontinued.

Option B is incorrect because continuous renal replacement therapy (RRT) is not indicated at this point, as the patient's kidney function may recover with volume expansion and correction of electrolyte imbalances.

Option C is incorrect because acute hemodialysis is not necessary at this point, as the patient's kidney function may recover with volume expansion and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Additionally, the patient's electrolyte imbalance and acid-base status need to be corrected before considering hemodialysis.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's clinical status, including her volume status, electrolyte levels, and acid-base status, and adjust management accordingly.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements is most accurate for this patient?,C,"The correct answer is B. AKI occurrence is highly predictive of deteriorating respiratory status.

This patient is at risk of developing Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) due to his underlying Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), diabetes, and hypertension, as well as the acute illness caused by COVID-19. Studies have shown that AKI is a strong predictor of deteriorating respiratory status in patients with COVID-19, particularly those who require mechanical ventilation.

Option A is incorrect because while AKI can occur rapidly, it often develops over a period of days rather than peaking within 24 hours.

Option C is also incorrect because while invasive ventilation is a risk factor for AKI, it is not the sole determining factor for the need for kidney replacement therapy (KRT).

Option D is incorrect because while diabetes is a risk factor for AKI, it is not the single most important risk factor. In this patient, his underlying CKD and acute illness are likely to be more significant contributors to his risk of AKI.

It's essential to closely monitor this patient's renal function and overall clinical status to promptly identify any signs of AKI and initiate appropriate management to prevent further deterioration.",Success
"Question 5624
The prevalence of hypertension in the adult world population is estimated at:",B,"The correct answer is C. 25%–55%.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the global prevalence of hypertension in adults aged 18 years and older is estimated to be around 30-40% (approximately 1.13 billion people). This falls within the range of 25% to 55% provided in option C.

Which ONE of the following should you tell the management team about hemodialyzer reuse?,B,"The correct answer is B. Gram-negative bloodstream infections have been reported with hemodialyzer reuse.

As a nephrologist, I would advise the management team that hemodialyzer reuse is a complex process that requires strict adherence to guidelines and protocols to minimize the risk of infections. While hemodialyzer reuse can be a cost-effective option, it is not without risks. Gram-negative bloodstream infections have been reported with hemodialyzer reuse, which can have serious consequences for patients.

Option A is incorrect because the infection risk with hemodialyzer reuse is not equal to that of a single-use dialyzer. Reused dialyzers can harbor bacteria and other microorganisms, which can increase the risk of infection.

Option C is also incorrect because dialyzer reprocessing is a complex, multi-step procedure that requires careful attention to detail and adherence to guidelines. It is not a simple, easy-to-perform procedure, even with automated reprocessing machines.

Option D is incorrect because while AAMI guidelines do provide recommendations for hemodialyzer reuse, there is no single, specific step-by-step procedure that is mandated for all facilities. Instead, facilities must develop their own protocols and procedures for hemodialyzer reuse, which must be based on evidence-based guidelines and best practices.

In conclusion, I would advise the management team to carefully consider the risks and benefits of hemodialyzer reuse and to develop a comprehensive protocol for reuse that prioritizes patient safety and minimizes the risk of infection.",Success
Which ONE the following should you tell your colleague about the evaluation and management of bone disease in CKD stage G3a–G5D?,B,"The correct answer is D. Denosumab may lead to hypercalcemia in patients with CKD.

In patients with CKD stage G3a-G5D, the evaluation and management of bone disease are complex and require a comprehensive approach. The provided laboratory results and DEXA scan suggest that the patient has secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is a common complication of advanced CKD.

Regarding the options:

A. Measurements of DEXA are not useful in predicting the underlying bone histologic features in patients with CKD stage G3a–G5D. DEXA measures bone density, but it does not provide information about bone histology.

B. DEXA is not predictive of fracture risk in adults with CKD stage G3a–G5D. While DEXA can predict fracture risk in the general population, its utility in CKD patients is limited due to the complex interplay of bone disease, mineral metabolism, and other factors.

C. Parathyroidectomy has been associated with increases in bone density in some studies, particularly in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism.

D. Denosumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits RANKL, can lead to hypocalcemia, not hypercalcemia, in patients with CKD. In fact, denosumab is often used to treat hypercalcemia in patients with CKD. However, it is essential to monitor calcium levels closely when using denosumab in CKD patients.

In this patient, the management of bone disease may involve a combination of phosphate binders, vitamin D analogs, and calcimimetics to control secondary hyperparathyroidism. Additionally, consideration should be given to bisphosphonates or denosumab to reduce fracture risk. However, the use of these medications requires careful monitoring of calcium levels and kidney function.",Success
"Question 2799:
Which ONE of the following statements is CORRECT concerning the use of rituximab for treatment of primary membranous nephropathy?",B,"The correct answer is B. Combinations of rituximab with low-dose cyclophosphamide can achieve very high remission rates.

Rationale:
Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20+ B cells, has been used to treat primary membranous nephropathy (PMN), a rare autoimmune kidney disease. Studies have shown that combining rituximab with low-dose cyclophosphamide can achieve high remission rates in patients with PMN. This combination therapy has been found to be effective in reducing proteinuria and improving kidney function.

The other options are incorrect:

A. The response to rituximab is not necessarily conditioned by the prior response to immunosuppressive therapeutic agents. While prior treatment with immunosuppressive agents may affect the response to rituximab, it is not a determining factor.

C. There is no evidence to suggest that a fixed dose of rituximab (four doses of 375 mg/m2 per week) is superior to a regimen based on serial measurement of circulating CD19-positive B cell counts in achieving a reduction in proteinuria. In fact, some studies have used a B cell-driven dosing strategy, where rituximab is administered based on CD19+ B cell counts, to optimize treatment outcomes.

D. The concomitant use of corticosteroids is not required for rituximab to be effective in treating PMN. While corticosteroids may be used in combination with rituximab to reduce proteinuria and inflammation, they are not a necessary component of rituximab therapy.",Success
Dysfunction of which ONE of the following nephron segments is contributing the MOST to this woman’s hypomagnesemia?,D,"The correct answer is A. The thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

The patient's laboratory results suggest a renal loss of magnesium, as evidenced by the high urine magnesium excretion (not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the high urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio). Cisplatin, a component of the chemotherapy regimen, is known to cause nephrotoxicity and specifically damage the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, leading to magnesium wasting.

The thick ascending limb is responsible for reabsorbing approximately 70% of filtered magnesium. Damage to this segment can result in excessive magnesium excretion in the urine, contributing to hypomagnesemia.

The other options are not directly related to magnesium wasting:

B. The medullary collecting duct is involved in potassium regulation, not magnesium.

C. The descending limb of the loop of Henle is primarily involved in sodium and water reabsorption.

D. The early distal convoluted tubule is involved in sodium, potassium, and calcium regulation, but not specifically magnesium.

It's essential to note that hypokalemia in this patient may also be related to the cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, as the thick ascending limb is also involved in potassium reabsorption. However, the question specifically asks about the nephron segment contributing the most to hypomagnesemia.",Success
"In addition to dietary sodium restriction, treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade, plus diuretic therapy, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Restart MMF and corticosteroids to treat a presumptive diagnosis of class V plus class III or IV lupus nephritis.

Here's why:

* The patient's presentation with ankle edema, facial rash, and proteinuria suggests a relapse of lupus nephritis.
* The urinalysis shows hematuria and proteinuria, and the urinary sediment contains acanthocytes, which are characteristic of glomerular damage.
* The patient's C3 level is low, which is consistent with active lupus nephritis.
* The 24-hour urine collection shows 5 grams of protein, which is a significant amount and indicates active kidney disease.
* Although the patient declined a repeat kidney biopsy, the clinical and laboratory findings suggest a relapse of lupus nephritis, possibly with a mixed class V plus class III or IV pattern.

Given the patient's history of class V lupus nephritis and the current presentation, restarting MMF and corticosteroids is the most appropriate next step in management. This treatment combination has been effective in inducing remission in lupus nephritis patients, and it is likely to be effective in this case as well.

Rituximab monotherapy (Option A) is not a standard treatment for lupus nephritis, and calcineurin inhibitors (Option B) are typically used for more severe cases of lupus nephritis or for those who are refractory to other treatments. Close follow-up without immunosuppression (Option C) is not sufficient given the patient's active kidney disease and proteinuria.",Success
Which of the following is correct regarding complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)?,A,"The correct answer is A. Renal cortical necrosis can be an underappreciated presentation of pregnancy-associated TMA.

Complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a rare but severe complication of pregnancy, often associated with preeclampsia. In this case, the patient's history of severe preeclampsia and AKI during her first pregnancy suggests a possible underlying TMA. Renal cortical necrosis is a known complication of TMA, and it can be an underappreciated presentation of pregnancy-associated TMA.

Option B is incorrect because pregnancy-associated TMA is often associated with abnormalities in genes encoding complement or complement regulatory proteins, such as mutations in the CFH, CFI, or MCP genes.

Option C is incorrect because not all subtypes of complement-mediated TMA have high recurrence rates after transplantation. For example, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) has a high recurrence rate, but other subtypes, such as C3 glomerulopathy, may have a lower recurrence rate.

Option D is incorrect because eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the terminal complement pathway, is often used to treat complement-mediated TMA. However, it is not recommended to stop eculizumab in transplant recipients who have stable renal function at 6 months after transplantation, as this may lead to recurrence of the disease. Instead, eculizumab is typically continued indefinitely to prevent recurrence.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?,A,"The correct answer is A. Reduce apixaban to 2.5 mg twice daily.

According to the FDA-approved labeling and current guidelines, apixaban dosing in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD) should be reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily. This is because apixaban is partially cleared by the kidneys, and patients with ESRD may have increased exposure to the drug, which can increase the risk of bleeding.

The patient's weight of 55 kg is not a factor in this decision, as the dosing adjustment is based on the patient's renal function. Warfarin therapy was declined due to the need for repeated blood monitoring, so changing to warfarin is not an option. Rivaroxaban is not recommended in patients with ESRD on HD, as it has not been studied in this population.

Adding a supplemental dose of apixaban after each HD session is not recommended, as this could lead to increased exposure to the drug and increase the risk of bleeding.

What is the best course of action for this patient at this moment?,A,"The correct answer is A. 24-hour urine collection for measurement of stone risk factors and blood for genetic analyses.

Here's why:

The patient's history of recurrent kidney stones and nephrocalcinosis suggests an underlying metabolic disorder, such as distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) or familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC). The patient's ethnicity (born in Iran) and family history (unknown) also raise suspicions of a genetic component.

Given the patient's concerns about his rising serum creatinine levels, it's essential to evaluate his stone risk factors and potential underlying genetic disorders. A 24-hour urine collection will help measure parameters such as urinary calcium, oxalate, citrate, and pH, which can guide further management. Additionally, genetic analyses may help identify any inherited disorders that could be contributing to his condition.

While referring to a urologist for surgical management of the kidney stones (Option B) may be necessary in the future, it's not the best course of action at this moment. The patient's stones are non-obstructing, and a more comprehensive evaluation of his underlying condition is warranted before considering surgical intervention.

Referring to a nutritionist (Option C) may be helpful in the future to assess and modify his dietary habits, but it's not the primary step at this point.

Option D is incorrect because nephrocalcinosis can progress to renal failure if left untreated or undertreated. While it's true that the radiologic appearance can be dramatic, it's essential to take a proactive approach to managing this condition.

By choosing Option A, we can gather more information about the patient's underlying condition and develop a personalized management plan to address his stone disease and potential genetic disorders.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate treatment?,D,"The correct answer is D. Add amiloride.

Here's why:

* The patient has resistant hypertension, proteinuria, and a history of favorable response to spironolactone, which suggests that a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) may be beneficial.
* However, spironolactone was discontinued due to gastrointestinal side effects.
* Amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic, can be used as an alternative to spironolactone. It has a similar mechanism of action, but with a lower risk of gastrointestinal side effects.
* Amiloride can help reduce proteinuria and blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension and CKD.
* The other options are not as suitable:
	+ Atenolol (A) is a beta blocker, which may not be the best choice for this patient, especially since he's already taking multiple antihypertensive medications.
	+ Minoxidil (B) is a potent vasodilator that can cause fluid retention and worsen edema, which is already present in this patient.
	+ Clonidine (C) is a central alpha-agonist that can cause drowsiness, dry mouth, and other side effects, and its efficacy in this patient is uncertain.

It's essential to note that the patient's potassium level is within the normal range, which makes amiloride a relatively safe choice. However, close monitoring of potassium levels will be necessary to avoid hyperkalemia.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell her about tenapanor for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in ESRD?,C,"The correct answer is C. Tenapanor caused a dose-dependent reduction in the serum phosphate concentration.

Tenapanor is a novel agent that enhances gastrointestinal excretion of phosphate by inhibiting the sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) in the gut, leading to a decrease in phosphate absorption. Studies have shown that tenapanor treatment results in a dose-dependent reduction in serum phosphate concentration in patients with ESRD.

Option A is incorrect because tenapanor inhibits NHE3, not the sodium-dependent phosphate transporter NPT2b.

Option B is incorrect because tenapanor treatment was associated with adverse events, particularly diarrhea, in a small percentage of study participants.

Option D is incorrect because tenapanor did not significantly affect serum calcium or potassium levels in clinical trials.

It's essential to discuss the potential benefits and risks of tenapanor with the patient, considering her history of gastrointestinal side effects with other phosphate binders.",Success
Which ONE of the following components of water puriﬁcation should you instruct them is responsible for the removal of the majority of endotoxins before the ﬁnal pass through endotoxin ultraﬁlters prior to feeding the distribution loop?,D,"The correct answer is C. Carbon medium.

During water purification for dialysis, the carbon medium plays a crucial role in removing the majority of endotoxins before the final pass through endotoxin ultrafilters prior to feeding the distribution loop. Activated carbon, a common component of carbon medium, has a high affinity for endotoxins and can effectively remove them from the water stream.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Water softener resin is primarily used to remove calcium and magnesium ions, which can cause scaling and fouling of the reverse osmosis membrane. While it may incidentally remove some endotoxins, it is not the primary mechanism for endotoxin removal.

B. The brine tank is used to regenerate the ion exchange resins in the water softener, and it is not directly involved in endotoxin removal.

D. The reverse osmosis membrane is a critical component of the water purification system, but it is not primarily responsible for removing endotoxins. While it can remove some endotoxins, its primary function is to remove dissolved solids and other impurities from the water stream.

It's essential to emphasize that a multi-step water purification process, including ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis, is necessary to produce high-quality dialysis water that meets the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standards.",Success
"At this point, which ONE of the following would you recommend next?",D,"The correct answer is C. Begin phosphate binder therapy.

The patient has a high phosphorus level (3.7 mg/dl) and an elevated PTH level (363 pg/ml), which is indicative of secondary hyperparathyroidism, a common complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend initiating phosphate binder therapy in patients with ESRD and elevated phosphorus levels to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and bone disease.

While calcitriol (option A) may be considered in the future to manage secondary hyperparathyroidism, it is not the next step in this scenario. Cinacalcet therapy (option B) is typically reserved for patients with severe hyperparathyroidism who are not responsive to other treatments. Measuring ionized calcium (option D) may be useful in certain situations, but it is not the primary concern in this scenario. Measuring PTH-related protein (option E) is not necessary, as the elevated PTH level is already indicative of secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Initiating phosphate binder therapy is the most appropriate next step to help manage the patient's phosphorus levels and prevent further complications.",Success
Which ONE of the following diagnostic tests is MOST appropriate to perform next?,C,"The correct answer is D. Fractional chloride clearance in response to hydrochlorothiazide at 50 mg.

This patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Gitelman syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria. The patient's history of salt craving, leg cramps, and polyuria, along with the laboratory findings of hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and low plasma renin and aldosterone levels, support this diagnosis.

The next step in diagnosis is to perform a fractional chloride clearance test in response to hydrochlorothiazide at 50 mg. This test is specific for Gitelman syndrome and can help differentiate it from other disorders that cause similar symptoms, such as Bartter syndrome. The test measures the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb chloride in response to hydrochlorothiazide, which is impaired in Gitelman syndrome.

Option A, 24-hour urine collection for potassium, may be useful in assessing potassium excretion, but it is not specific for Gitelman syndrome.

Option B, genetic testing for mutations in the CLCNKB gene, may be useful in confirming the diagnosis, but it is not the next step in diagnosis.

Option C, urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio, may be useful in assessing calcium excretion, but it is not specific for Gitelman syndrome and is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Fractional chloride clearance in response to hydrochlorothiazide at 50 mg.",Success
"Regarding the eﬀect of tight BP control on kidney function, which of the following is correct?",B,"The correct answer is B. Intensive BP control in SPRINT was associated with a small but persistent decline in GFR compared with standard BP control.

The SPRINT trial demonstrated that intensive blood pressure control (target systolic BP < 120 mmHg) was associated with a small but persistent decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared to standard BP control (target systolic BP < 140 mmHg). This decline in GFR was not associated with an increased risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or a 50% decline in GFR.

Option A is incorrect because while intensive BP control may lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) in some patients, there is no evidence to suggest that AKI in patients without prior chronic kidney disease (CKD) will progress to ESRD.

Option C is incorrect because the SPRINT trial did not find an association between intensive BP control and higher levels of kidney injury biomarkers, indicating permanent kidney damage.

Option D is incorrect because while intensive BP control was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events, it was not associated with a reduced risk of renal endpoints such as ESRD or a 50% decline in GFR.

In the context of this patient's case, the increase in serum creatinine and decline in estimated GFR may be related to the addition of a third medication to lower her BP, and further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and optimal treatment approach.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell your colleague about cognitive function in ESRD patients?,A,"The correct answer is D. The rate of decline in cognitive function within the first 3 years of dialysis initiation is similar among patients treated with either PD or HD.

Research has shown that patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) often experience cognitive impairment, which can affect their quality of life and daily functioning. However, the rate of decline in cognitive function is not significantly different between patients treated with hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) within the first 3 years of dialysis initiation.

Option A is incorrect because while cognitive impairment is common in ESRD patients, it's not a universal experience. A significant proportion of patients may not experience deterioration of cognitive function.

Option B is incorrect because depression is a known contributor to cognitive impairment in ESRD patients. Depression can exacerbate cognitive decline, and addressing depression is an essential aspect of managing cognitive function in these patients.

Option C is incorrect because while kidney transplantation can improve cognitive function in some patients, it's not a guarantee, and cognitive performance may not always improve. Additionally, cognitive function at initiation of dialysis is often already impaired compared to the general population, and transplantation may not completely reverse this impairment.

It's essential to note that small vessel disease, as seen on the patient's brain MRI, can contribute to cognitive impairment, and a comprehensive approach to managing cognitive function should be taken, including addressing depression, optimizing dialysis, and considering transplantation or changes in dialysis modality.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements is CORRECT regarding her risk of CKD progression and preterm delivery?,A,"The correct answer is D. Her risk of extreme preterm delivery (< 34-weeks gestation) is about 20%.

According to the American Society of Nephrology and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, women with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and proteinuria, like this patient, are at increased risk for preterm delivery and CKD progression during pregnancy.

Studies have shown that women with CKD and proteinuria have a higher risk of preterm delivery, particularly extreme preterm delivery (< 34 weeks). A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases found that the risk of extreme preterm delivery in women with CKD was around 20%.

Regarding CKD progression, the risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during or shortly postpartum is not as high as 50% (option B). While pregnancy can accelerate CKD progression, the risk of ESRD during or shortly postpartum is more likely around 10-20% (option A).

Option C, a risk of preterm delivery (< 37 weeks) of about 20%, is an underestimate, as the risk of preterm delivery in women with CKD and proteinuria is generally higher than this.",Success
"Compared with ABO-compatible trans-plantation, which ONE of following outcomes at 1 year is expected in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Increased risk of uncensored graft loss.

ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation, as in this patient's case, is associated with a higher risk of graft loss compared to ABO-compatible transplantation. This is because the presence of pre-existing anti-A or anti-B antibodies can lead to antibody-mediated rejection, which can result in graft failure.

Studies have shown that ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation is associated with a higher risk of graft loss, particularly in the first year after transplantation. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Transplantation found that ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation was associated with a higher risk of graft loss at 1 year compared to ABO-compatible transplantation (1).

In contrast, the other options are not supported by evidence:

A. ABO-incompatible transplantation is actually associated with a higher risk of antibody-mediated rejection, not a decreased risk.

B. There is no evidence to suggest that ABO-incompatible transplantation is associated with a decreased risk of bleeding complications.

C. ABO-incompatible transplantation is not associated with a decreased risk of infections.

Which ONE of the following should you tell her?,A,"The correct answer is A. Yes, cigarette smoking, cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin use are all associated with an increased risk of kidney failure.

Evidence-based practices and current medical guidelines support the association between these substances and kidney disease:

* Cigarette smoking is a known risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020).
* Cocaine use has been linked to various kidney injuries, including acute kidney injury, CKD, and ESRD (Source: National Kidney Foundation, 2020).
* Methamphetamine use has been associated with an increased risk of CKD, ESRD, and acute kidney injury (Source: Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, 2018).
* Heroin use has been linked to an increased risk of CKD and ESRD, particularly in individuals with a history of injection drug use (Source: Kidney International, 2017).

It is essential to highlight these substances as risk factors for kidney disease in the community health center's anti-drug and anti-tobacco campaign to raise awareness and promote prevention strategies among the target population.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in this patient’s diagnostic evaluation?,D,"The correct answer is A. Stain the specimen for serum amyloid P component.

Here's why:

The patient has been diagnosed with amyloidosis based on the renal biopsy, but the type of amyloidosis is still unknown. The absence of staining for monoclonal light or heavy chains and serum amyloid A (SAA) suggests that the amyloidosis is not related to a plasma cell dyscrasia (e.g., multiple myeloma) or an inflammatory response.

The next step is to determine the type of amyloidosis. Staining the biopsy specimen for serum amyloid P (SAP) component is a useful diagnostic test to help differentiate between various types of amyloidosis. SAP is a normal serum protein that binds to amyloid fibrils and is often present in amyloid deposits. A positive SAP stain would support a diagnosis of reactive amyloidosis or wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps:

B. Serum immunofixation assay is not necessary, as the serum protein electrophoresis and free light-chain assay have already been performed, and the results do not suggest a monoclonal gammopathy.

C. Urinary electrophoresis is not relevant to the diagnosis of amyloidosis.

D. Laser dissection/mass spectrometry analysis of the biopsy specimen may be useful in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario.

E. Ig isotype and subclass stains after pronase digestion of the paraffin-embedded specimen may be useful in certain cases, but it is not the most relevant test in this scenario.

It's essential to determine the type of amyloidosis to guide further management and treatment. Staining for SAP is a crucial step in this process.",Success
"With regard to patients choosing conservative management of ESKD, which of the following is correct?",D,"The correct answer is D. Those who pursue conservative management spend less time in hospital.

Conservative management of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a viable option for patients who choose not to pursue dialysis. Studies have shown that patients who opt for conservative management tend to spend less time in the hospital compared to those who initiate dialysis. This is likely due to the fact that conservative management focuses on symptom management and palliative care, rather than life-prolonging treatments.

Option A is incorrect because patients who choose conservative management are more likely to use hospice services in the last 30 days of life, as they tend to have a more predictable disease trajectory and can benefit from hospice care.

Option B is also incorrect. While dialysis can prolong life in some patients, the survival benefit is not universal and may not apply to all patients, especially those with significant comorbidities. In fact, some studies suggest that conservative management may be associated with similar or even better survival outcomes in certain patient populations, such as the elderly or those with multiple comorbidities.

Option C is incorrect as well. Family members and caregivers of patients pursuing conservative management often report higher quality of life and less burden compared to those caring for patients on dialysis. This is likely due to the fact that conservative management focuses on symptom control and improving quality of life, rather than prolonging life at all costs.

It's essential to have an open and honest discussion with the patient and her daughter about the pros and cons of conservative management, including the potential benefits and limitations, to ensure that they make an informed decision that aligns with the patient's values and goals.",Success
What is the best management strategy?,C,"The correct answer is C. Hold nivolumab and initiate glucocorticoids.

According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines, when a patient experiences immune-related adverse events (irAEs) such as severe tubulointerstitial nephritis due to immune checkpoint inhibitors, the recommended management strategy is to hold the offending agent (in this case, nivolumab) and initiate glucocorticoids to mitigate the adverse effect.

The goal of holding the medication is to prevent further damage to the kidneys, while the glucocorticoids can help reduce inflammation and promote recovery. In this scenario, it is essential to prioritize the patient's kidney function and address the severe nephritis before considering further cancer treatment.

Option A is incorrect because continuing nivolumab could exacerbate the kidney damage. Option B is incomplete, as simply monitoring kidney function without intervening with glucocorticoids may not be sufficient to address the severe nephritis. Option D is incorrect because switching to ipilimumab, another immune checkpoint inhibitor, may not address the current kidney damage and could potentially cause further irAEs. Option E is incorrect because, while immune checkpoint inhibitors may need to be permanently discontinued in some cases, this decision should be made on a case-by-case basis, and in this scenario, holding the medication and initiating glucocorticoids is the recommended initial approach.",Success
Which ONE of the following biopsy ﬁndings is MOST consistent with the diagnosis of Mesoamerican nephropathy?,A,"The correct answer is C. Collapse and sclerosis of the entire glomerular tuft.

Mesoamerican nephropathy is a chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology that affects young adults, particularly males, in certain regions of Mesoamerica, including Costa Rica. The characteristic biopsy findings of Mesoamerican nephropathy include glomerular lesions, specifically collapse and sclerosis of the entire glomerular tuft, also known as glomerular collapse or glomerular sclerosis. This is often accompanied by tubulointerstitial fibrosis and inflammation.

Option A is more consistent with acute tubulointerstitial nephritis, which is a different diagnosis. Option B is characteristic of immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, such as lupus nephritis or post-infectious glomerulonephritis. Option D is more consistent with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, which is a distinct clinical entity.

It's essential to note that the diagnosis of Mesoamerican nephropathy is often made based on a combination of clinical, laboratory, and pathological findings, as well as the patient's geographic origin and occupation (e.g., agricultural workers).",Success
Which ONE of the following lesions is MOST likely to be found on renal biopsy?,D,"Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results, the correct answer is D. IgA nephropathy.

Here's why:

* The patient has asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, which is a common presentation of IgA nephropathy.
* The presence of dysmorphic erythrocytes in the urine sediment suggests a glomerular source of bleeding, which is consistent with IgA nephropathy.
* The spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 39 mg/g indicates mild proteinuria, which is also consistent with IgA nephropathy.
* The patient's age, ethnicity, and lack of other underlying conditions make IgA nephropathy a more likely diagnosis.
* FSGS (A) is less likely given the patient's mild proteinuria and lack of other signs of nephrotic syndrome.
* Thin basement membrane nephropathy (B) typically presents with isolated hematuria and minimal proteinuria, but the presence of dysmorphic erythrocytes and mild proteinuria in this patient makes IgA nephropathy more likely.
* Minimal change disease (C) typically presents with nephrotic syndrome, which is not seen in this patient.
* Early diabetic glomerulosclerosis (E) is unlikely given the patient's normal serum creatinine and fasting blood glucose levels, as well as the lack of other signs of diabetic nephropathy.

IgA nephropathy is a common glomerulonephritis that often presents with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, and it is more prevalent in Asian populations. Renal biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",Success
"Question 2820:
Which ONE of the following indicates a high probability of recurrence of a primary form of an FSGS lesion in an adult patient receiving a living donor transplant?",B,"The correct answer is D. Family history of nephrotic syndrome.

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome, and recurrence of FSGS after kidney transplantation is a significant concern. According to current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices, a family history of nephrotic syndrome is a strong predictor of recurrence of FSGS in adult patients receiving a living donor transplant.

Studies have shown that patients with a family history of FSGS or nephrotic syndrome are more likely to experience recurrence of the disease after transplantation. This is because FSGS can be caused by genetic mutations, and a family history of the disease suggests a possible genetic predisposition.

The other options are not directly related to the recurrence of FSGS in adult patients receiving a living donor transplant:

A. Urine protein < 6 g per day at the time of diagnosis prior to transplant: While proteinuria is a hallmark of FSGS, the amount of proteinuria at the time of diagnosis does not directly predict recurrence after transplantation.

B. Serum albumin < 3.5 g/dl at the time of diagnosis prior to transplant: Hypoalbuminemia is a common feature of nephrotic syndrome, but it is not a specific predictor of recurrence after transplantation.

C. Lower eGFR at the time of diagnosis prior to transplant: While a lower eGFR may indicate more advanced kidney disease, it is not a specific predictor of recurrence of FSGS after transplantation.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Family history of nephrotic syndrome.",Success
"BP is 119/80 mm Hg on losartan 100 mg.
On the basis of current data, what is the next BEST course of treatment?",A,"Based on current data, the next BEST course of treatment is:

D. Add lisinopril 10 mg/d

Here's why:

* The patient has biopsy-demonstrated IgA nephropathy with hematuria and microalbuminuria, indicating kidney damage and proteinuria.
* The current blood pressure (BP) of 119/80 mmHg on losartan 100 mg is relatively well-controlled, but the proteinuria level of 600 mg/g creatinine suggests that the patient is still at risk for progression.
* The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as first-line therapy for patients with IgA nephropathy and proteinuria.
* Lisinopril is an ACEi that can help reduce proteinuria and slow disease progression. Adding lisinopril to the current losartan therapy can provide additional renoprotective benefits.
* Option A, adding dapagliflozin, is not supported by current evidence for IgA nephropathy, and its use is primarily indicated for type 2 diabetes and heart failure.
* Option B is incorrect because, despite the normal eGFR, the patient's proteinuria level indicates ongoing kidney damage, and additional therapy is needed to slow disease progression.
* Option C, adding chlorthalidone, may help with BP control, but it is not the most effective strategy for reducing proteinuria and slowing disease progression in this patient.

By adding lisinopril, the patient can benefit from the synergistic effects of dual renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade, which can help reduce proteinuria and slow disease progression.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate treatment for this patient?,A,"The correct answer is A. Plasmapheresis, high-dose corticosteroids, and cyclophosphamide.

The patient's presentation with hemoptysis, respiratory distress, and diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage on bronchoscopy suggests a diagnosis of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The presence of acanthocytes and erythrocyte casts in the urinalysis also indicates glomerulonephritis, which is often associated with DAH.

Given the patient's recent treatment with alemtuzumab, a lymphocyte-depleting agent, the most likely cause of DAH is alemtuzumab-induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia and glomerulonephritis. This is a rare but known complication of alemtuzumab treatment.

The recommended treatment for DAH associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia and glomerulonephritis is a combination of plasmapheresis, high-dose corticosteroids, and cyclophosphamide. Plasmapheresis can help remove circulating autoantibodies, while high-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide can suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation.

Rituximab (option C) is not typically used for DAH, and cyclosporine A (option B) is not a recommended treatment for this condition. Intravenous Ig (option D) may be used for autoimmune hemolytic anemia, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for DAH.",Success
"In addition to ongoing monitoring of the serum sodium level and neurologic status, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate treatment for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Desmopressin at 4 mg subcutaneously plus intravenous 5% dextrose in water (D5W) to achieve a serum sodium of 118–122 mEq/L.

This patient has developed hyponatremia (serum sodium < 120 mEq/L) due to excessive fluid intake and desmopressin therapy, which can cause water retention. The urine osmolality of 826 mOsm/kg initially suggested that the patient's desmopressin therapy was effective, but the subsequent rise in urine volume and decrease in urine osmolality after withholding desmopressin indicate that the patient was indeed over-treated.

To correct the hyponatremia, it is essential to slowly and carefully increase the serum sodium level to prevent complications such as central pontine myelinolysis. The American Heart Association recommends correcting hyponatremia at a rate of 0.5-1 mmol/L per hour to a maximum of 8-10 mmol/L in the first 24 hours.

Option B is the most appropriate treatment because it addresses the hyponatremia while also taking into account the patient's underlying central diabetes insipidus. The subcutaneous desmopressin will help to regulate the patient's urine output, and the intravenous D5W will help to slowly increase the serum sodium level to a target range of 118-122 mEq/L.

Options A and C are incorrect because restarting desmopressin at the same dose or adding 3% saline could exacerbate the hyponatremia. Option D is also incorrect because administering D5W alone without addressing the underlying diabetes insipidus could lead to further complications.",Success
Which ONE of the following is MOST important in the pathogenesis of her hyponatremia?,A,"The correct answer is A. Excessive water intake and retention.

This patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH), a condition that occurs when athletes engage in prolonged physical activity and consume excessive amounts of water, leading to dilutional hyponatremia.

The patient's serum sodium level of 125 mEq/L is significantly low, and her obtunded state suggests severe hyponatremia. The normal skin turgor and blood pressure rule out dehydration as the cause of her hyponatremia.

Excessive water intake and retention (Option A) is the most important factor in the pathogenesis of EAH. During prolonged exercise, athletes may drink large amounts of water to replenish lost fluids, but if they consume more water than they lose in sweat, it can lead to dilutional hyponatremia.

Option B, sequestration of water in the gastrointestinal tract, is not a significant contributor to EAH. While some water may be sequestered in the gut during exercise, it is not a primary cause of hyponatremia.

Option C, sodium chloride loss in sweat, may contribute to hyponatremia, but it is not the primary cause in this scenario. Marathon runners do lose sodium in sweat, but the amount lost is typically not sufficient to cause severe hyponatremia.

Option D, decreased extracellular fluid volume, is not consistent with the patient's normal blood pressure and skin turgor, which suggest that her extracellular fluid volume is normal.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American College of Sports Medicine, emphasize the importance of avoiding excessive fluid intake during endurance exercise to prevent EAH.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the BEST choice for induction therapy for this patient?,A,"The correct answer is A. A combination of low-dose tacrolimus and low-dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with prednisone.

The patient has class IV lupus nephritis, which requires aggressive induction therapy to prevent further kidney damage. The initial recommendation of cyclophosphamide is reasonable, but the patient refuses due to concerns about premature ovarian failure. 

Tacrolimus and MMF are both effective alternatives for induction therapy in lupus nephritis. The combination of low-dose tacrolimus and low-dose MMF with prednisone has been shown to be effective in inducing remission in patients with lupus nephritis, with a lower risk of ovarian toxicity compared to cyclophosphamide. 

Azathioprine (option B) is not as effective as MMF for induction therapy in lupus nephritis, and its use may be associated with a higher risk of side effects. Rituximab (option C) is not typically used as monotherapy for lupus nephritis induction, and belimumab (option D) is not approved for the treatment of lupus nephritis.",Success
Which ONE of the following would be the BEST advice regarding the differences between PD and home hemodialysis (HHD)?,B,"The correct answer is D. If she chooses HHD, dialysis should begin in center and then transition to home to facilitate access maturation.

This advice is supported by current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices. Home hemodialysis (HHD) requires a mature and functioning arteriovenous (AV) access, which can take several weeks to months to develop. Starting HHD in a center allows for closer monitoring and access maturation, reducing the risk of complications and improving outcomes. Once the access is mature, the patient can transition to performing HHD at home.

The other options are not accurate:

A. There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that HHD increases the risk of all-cause mortality compared to PD.

B. While HHD may offer some advantages, such as increased frequency and longer dialysis sessions, it does not necessarily confer a lower risk of hospitalization compared to PD.

C. Technique failure is a common issue in both HHD and PD, and the rates are not significantly different between the two modalities.

It's essential to provide accurate and evidence-based information to patients considering different dialysis options, empowering them to make informed decisions about their care.",Success
Which ONE of the following is MOST likely to provide an indication for a possible monogenic or digenic cause of his disease?,E,"The correct answer is E. His age.

Nephrotic syndrome in children and adolescents, especially those under the age of 18, is more likely to have a genetic cause. The younger the age of onset, the higher the likelihood of a monogenic or digenic cause. In this case, the patient's age of 16 years suggests a possible genetic component to his disease.

The other options are not directly related to indicating a possible monogenic or digenic cause:

A. The histologic variant of FSGS (not otherwise specified in this case) does not necessarily imply a genetic cause.

B. The level of renal function, as indicated by the serum creatinine level, is more related to the severity of kidney damage rather than the underlying cause.

C. The level of proteinuria is also a measure of disease severity, but it does not provide information about the genetic basis of the disease.

D. His ancestry, being of Scottish descent, does not specifically point to a genetic cause, as nephrotic syndrome can occur in individuals of any ethnicity.

It's essential to consider the patient's age and other factors, such as family history and response to treatment, when evaluating the possibility of a genetic cause of nephrotic syndrome. Genetic testing may be warranted to identify potential genetic mutations that could be contributing to the disease.",Success
"Regarding remission maintenance therapy in AAV, which of the following is MOST correct?",D,"The correct answer is D. Prolonged maintenance treatment with rituximab for up to 3 years is associated with a lower relapse rate and similar incidence of serious adverse events compared with maintenance treatment for 18 months.

This answer is supported by the MAINRITSAN 2 trial, which compared the efficacy and safety of rituximab maintenance therapy for 18 months versus 3 years in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) in remission. The study found that prolonged maintenance treatment with rituximab for up to 3 years was associated with a lower relapse rate and similar incidence of serious adverse events compared with maintenance treatment for 18 months.

Option A is incorrect because the MAINRITSAN trial actually found that rituximab maintenance therapy for 18 months was associated with fewer infections compared with azathioprine maintenance therapy.

Option B is incorrect because while a rituximab dosing strategy based on repopulation of peripheral B cells and/or changes in ANCA titer has been studied, the evidence suggests that this approach may not be superior to regular scheduled dosing of rituximab in terms of preventing relapses.

Option C is incorrect because the study examining the duration of treatment with oral immunosuppressants to maintain remission found that prolonged treatment with azathioprine and prednisone for 48 months was associated with a lower risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) compared with treatment for 24 months.",Success
Which ONE of the following would lead to the MOST rapid stone passage and relief of symptoms for this patient?,C,"The correct answer is B. Tamsulosin.

The patient has a 6-mm calcium oxalate stone in the mid-ureter, and the goal is to facilitate stone passage and relieve symptoms. Tamsulosin, an alpha-blocker, is commonly used to help pass ureteral stones. It relaxes the ureteral smooth muscle, reducing ureteral spasm and increasing the likelihood of stone passage.

Studies have shown that tamsulosin increases the stone passage rate and reduces the time to stone expulsion compared to control groups (1, 2). The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend the use of alpha-blockers, such as tamsulosin, to facilitate stone passage for ureteral stones <10 mm in diameter (3).

In this scenario, tamsulosin is the most likely to lead to rapid stone passage and relief of symptoms.

Which ONE of the following should you tell him about incremental initiation of dialysis and issues related to preservation of residual renal function?,A,"The correct answer is A. Incremental HD is associated with a significantly slower decline in residual kidney function compared with conventional dialysis.

Incremental initiation of dialysis involves starting with a lower frequency or duration of dialysis sessions and gradually increasing them as needed, with the goal of preserving residual renal function (RRF). Studies have shown that incremental HD is associated with a slower decline in RRF compared to conventional three-times-per-week dialysis. This is because incremental HD allows for a more gentle initiation of dialysis, which can help reduce the stress on the remaining kidney function.

The other options are incorrect:

B. There is no evidence to suggest that incremental HD is associated with increased mortality in patients with baseline residual urea clearance > 6 ml/min per 1.73 m2.

C. Preservation of RRF is associated with a mortality benefit in both peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD). RRF is an important predictor of survival in patients with end-stage renal disease, and preserving it is a key goal of dialysis therapy.

D. While preserving RRF may have benefits for anemia management and nutrition, there is no specific evidence to suggest that patients who undergo incremental dialysis require lower doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents or have significantly higher serum albumin levels.",Success
"In this case, ANCA-associated vasculitis is MOST likely overlapping with which ONE of the following diagnoses?",A,"The correct answer is A. IgG4-related disease.

The patient's presentation with bilateral upper eyelid edema, hard masses palpable under the upper lids, and lacrimal gland biopsy showing whirling fibrotic tissue encasing lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates is consistent with IgG4-related disease. The presence of ANCA-associated vasculitis, specifically PR3-ANCA, and the kidney biopsy showing pauci-immune crescentic necrotizing GN suggests an overlap with IgG4-related disease.

IgG4-related disease is a systemic disorder characterized by infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and fibrosis in various organs, including the lacrimal and salivary glands, kidneys, and aorta. The patient's symptoms and biopsy findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

The other options are not supported by the patient's presentation and biopsy findings:

B. Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disorder that can affect the lacrimal glands, but it is not typically associated with ANCA-associated vasculitis or the specific biopsy findings in this case.

C. Kikuchi disease is a rare, self-limited disorder characterized by lymphadenitis and is not associated with IgG4-related disease or ANCA-associated vasculitis.

D. Cogan's syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by interstitial keratitis and vestibuloauditory symptoms, but it is not associated with IgG4-related disease or ANCA-associated vasculitis.

It's essential to note that the patient's diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation, and a multidisciplinary approach involving rheumatology, nephrology, and pathology specialists would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan.",Success
"In addition to symptomatic treatment with topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?",A,"The correct answer is A. Dialyze the patient at the far end of the room, and restrict the chair solely for that patient’s use.

Bedbug infestations are a growing concern in healthcare settings, including dialysis facilities. Since the patient's partner has similar symptoms, it is likely that the bedbugs are coming from their home environment. To prevent further transmission and infestation in the dialysis facility, it is essential to take environmental measures.

Dialyzing the patient at the far end of the room and restricting the chair solely for that patient's use can help minimize the risk of bedbug transmission to other patients and staff. This approach is supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines for bedbug control in healthcare settings.

Option B is incorrect because implementing no additional environmental measures would allow the infestation to spread further.

Option C is incorrect because assigning the patient to an isolation room may not be necessary or practical, especially if the patient requires regular dialysis treatment.

Option D is incorrect because permethrin 5% cream is a treatment for scabies, not bedbug bites. While it may help alleviate pruritus, it is not an effective management strategy for bedbug infestations.

It is essential to educate the patient and their partner on how to eradicate bedbugs from their home environment, including washing and drying clothing and bedding on hot settings, drying non-washable items on hot settings for at least 20 minutes, and using a professional pest control service if necessary.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell her about tolerance induction?,B,"The correct answer is C. Demonstration of CD4(+) CD25(high) FOXP3(+) T regulatory cells in peripheral blood fails to predict transplantation tolerance.

Tolerance induction is a promising approach to reduce or eliminate the need for long-term immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients. While there have been advances in this area, it's essential to provide accurate and evidence-based information to the patient.

Option C is correct because, although CD4(+) CD25(high) FOXP3(+) T regulatory cells are thought to play a role in transplantation tolerance, their presence in peripheral blood does not reliably predict tolerance. In fact, studies have shown that these cells can be present in patients who are not tolerant, and their absence does not necessarily indicate a lack of tolerance.

Option A is incorrect because, while achieving clinical tolerance has proven challenging, there have been successful cases of tolerance induction in human kidney transplant recipients, particularly in the context of living donor kidney transplantation.

Option B is incorrect because, while it is true that clinical tolerance has been induced in some zero antigen mismatched living donor recipients, the durability of tolerance is not limited to only about one-third of patients. In fact, some studies have reported higher rates of durable tolerance in this population.

Option D is incorrect because B cells do play a role in the induction and maintenance of clinical tolerance, particularly in the context of antibody-mediated rejection.

It's essential to provide the patient with accurate and evidence-based information about tolerance induction, highlighting both the potential benefits and the current limitations of this approach.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely outcome of this intervention?,B,"The correct answer is B. A reduced risk of subsequent fistula thrombosis.

The patient's elevated dynamic and derived static venous pressures (> 0.55) indicate a high risk of fistula thrombosis. The fistulogram identified a 60% outflow stenosis, which is a common cause of fistula thrombosis. Successful treatment with angioplasty is likely to reduce the risk of subsequent fistula thrombosis by improving blood flow and reducing turbulence in the outflow tract.

The other options are not directly related to the outcome of angioplasty for outflow stenosis:

A. While angioplasty may reduce the risk of permanent access loss in the long term, this is not a direct outcome of the intervention.

C. The need for subsequent surgical interventions may not be directly affected by angioplasty for outflow stenosis.

D. There is no evidence to suggest that angioplasty would increase the rate of complication-related hospitalizations.

According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, angioplasty is a recommended treatment for outflow stenosis in hemodialysis fistulas, with a goal of reducing the risk of thrombosis and improving fistula patency.",Success
Which of the following variables BEST predicts her risk of developing ESKD?,C,"The correct answer is C. A high chronicity score.

The patient's kidney biopsy shows a membranoproliferative pattern, which is consistent with C3 glomerulopathy, a type of glomerulonephritis. The chronicity score is a histopathological scoring system that evaluates the degree of chronic kidney damage, such as glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, and tubular atrophy.

Studies have shown that a high chronicity score is a strong predictor of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in patients with C3 glomerulopathy (1, 2). The chronicity score takes into account the extent of glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage, which are important determinants of kidney function decline.

The other options are not as strongly predictive of ESKD risk:

A. Electron-dense intramembranous deposits on electron microscopy are a characteristic feature of C3 glomerulopathy, but their presence does not necessarily predict ESKD risk.

B. Low C3 levels can indicate active disease, but they are not a reliable predictor of ESKD risk.

D. Blood pressure (BP) is an important factor in kidney disease progression, but in this case, the patient's BP is only mildly elevated, and it is not as strong a predictor of ESKD risk as the chronicity score.

Which of the following risk tools would be appropriate to use in a population with GFR > 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2?,D,"The correct answer is D. Incident CKD risk tool.

The scenario describes a population with a normal eGFR (> 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2), and the goal is to identify patients at risk of developing kidney disease. The Incident CKD risk tool is specifically designed to predict the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) in individuals with a normal eGFR.

The 4-variable and 8-variable kidney failure risk equations (options A and B) are used to predict the risk of progression to kidney failure in patients with established CKD, not to identify individuals at risk of developing CKD.

The Advanced CKD risk tool (option C) is used to predict the risk of progression to advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2) in patients with established CKD, not to identify individuals at risk of developing CKD.

The Incident CKD risk tool, on the other hand, uses a combination of demographic and clinical variables, such as age, sex, blood pressure, and urine ACR, to predict the 5-year risk of developing CKD in individuals with a normal eGFR. This tool is well-suited for the described population and goal.",Success
What is the next best test to evaluate the role of renal phosphate wasting in this patient’s hypophosphatemia?,D,"The correct answer is D. Tubular maximal reabsorption of phosphate/GFR in a second morning urine after an overnight fast.

Here's why:

The patient presents with hypophosphatemia (serum phosphate level of 0.3 mmol/L) and a low serum bicarbonate level, suggesting a possible renal tubular acidosis (RTA). The history of Raynaud syndrome and migraine headaches may be related to an underlying autoimmune disorder, which could contribute to the development of RTA.

To evaluate the role of renal phosphate wasting in this patient's hypophosphatemia, the next best test would be to assess the tubular reabsorption of phosphate. The tubular maximal reabsorption of phosphate/GFR (TmP/GFR) is a measure of the kidney's ability to reabsorb phosphate. A low TmP/GFR would suggest renal phosphate wasting, which could be contributing to the patient's hypophosphatemia.

Option A, measuring serum PTH and FGF23 concentrations, would be useful in evaluating for hyperparathyroidism or tumor-induced osteomalacia, but it is not the most direct test to assess renal phosphate wasting.

Option B, serum protein electrophoresis and light chains, would be useful in evaluating for multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders, but it is not directly related to the patient's hypophosphatemia.

Option C, fractional excretion of phosphate, can be useful in evaluating phosphate handling, but it is not as specific as the TmP/GFR in assessing renal phosphate wasting.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Tubular maximal reabsorption of phosphate/GFR in a second morning urine after an overnight fast.",Success
Which ONE of the following would you advise to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes?,B,"The correct answer is C. Stop enalapril at least 2 months before conception.

As a medical assistant, I would advise the patient to stop taking enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, at least 2 months before conception. ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy due to their potential to cause fetal renal damage and oligohydramnios, particularly in the second and third trimesters. Although the patient's blood pressure is well-controlled, it's essential to switch to a pregnancy-safe antihypertensive medication to minimize risks to the fetus.

Option B, targeting a hemoglobin A1c of < 7.0% before conception, is important for optimal glycemic control, but it's not the most critical advice in this scenario. The patient's current hemoglobin A1c level of 7.8% is close to the target, and further optimization can be achieved through continued insulin therapy and lifestyle modifications.

Option A, making no changes to the current regimen, is not advisable due to the risks associated with enalapril use during pregnancy.

Option D, holding enalapril for the duration of breastfeeding, is not relevant to the current scenario, as the patient is planning to become pregnant, not breastfeeding.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA), women with diabetes and hypertension should optimize their glycemic control and blood pressure management before conception, and ACE inhibitors should be discontinued or replaced with pregnancy-safe alternatives.",Success
"In addition to admission for fetal monitoring and urgent delivery, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?",C,"The correct answer is D. Labetalol plus intravenous nitrates.

This patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of heart failure, including dyspnea, leg edema, and bibasilar crackles, which are likely exacerbated by her pregnancy. The echocardiogram showing a global reduction in left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 35% supports this diagnosis.

Given the patient's hypertension and heart failure, labetalol, a beta-blocker, is a suitable choice to control her blood pressure and reduce cardiac workload. Intravenous nitrates can help reduce preload and alleviate symptoms of heart failure.

Option A, beginning intravenous insulin, is not the most pressing concern at this moment, as the patient's glucose level is relatively well-controlled.

Option B, sodium restriction and compression stockings, may be helpful in managing edema, but it does not address the patient's heart failure and hypertension.

Option C, furosemide, may be used to manage edema and volume overload, but it can also worsen the patient's hypertension and proteinuria, and may not be the most appropriate first-line choice in this scenario.

Urgent delivery is necessary due to the patient's deteriorating cardiac function and the risk of complications to both the mother and the fetus.",Success
Which of the following statement is true regarding this patient’s phosphate balance?,C,"The correct answer is C. Her phosphate concentration is maintained by intestinal absorption, internal shifts and renal excretion.

Here's why:

Hypophosphatemia in this patient can be attributed to several factors related to her kidney disease, transplant status, and medications. Phosphate balance is maintained through a complex interplay of intestinal absorption, internal shifts, and renal excretion. In patients with ESRD, phosphate levels can be affected by impaired renal function, leading to phosphate retention. However, after kidney transplantation, phosphate levels may decrease due to improved renal function and increased phosphate excretion.

The medications this patient is taking can also impact phosphate balance. Corticosteroids like prednisone can increase urinary phosphate excretion, contributing to hypophosphatemia. Additionally, tacrolimus, an immunosuppressant, can cause hypophosphatemia by increasing urinary phosphate excretion and decreasing intestinal phosphate absorption.

Option A is incorrect because the patient's medications, particularly prednisone and tacrolimus, can affect phosphate balance. Option B is also incorrect because the patient's kidney disease and transplant status, as well as her medications, can all contribute to hypophosphatemia. Option D is incorrect because while phosphate sensing molecules have been identified in animal models, there is no clear evidence of their role in post-transplantation hypophosphatemia in humans.",Success
What strategies can you implement to prevent AKI?,C,"The correct answer is C. Give 0.9% sodium chloride before and after cardiac catheterization.

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a significant concern in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization, especially in those with pre-existing kidney disease or risk factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and peripheral artery disease. Contrast-induced AKI (CI-AKI) is a type of AKI that occurs due to the use of iodinated contrast media during cardiac catheterization.

To prevent CI-AKI, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recommend the following strategies:

1. Hydration with isotonic fluids (0.9% sodium chloride) before and after the procedure to reduce the risk of CI-AKI. This is the most effective method to prevent CI-AKI.
2. Avoiding the use of high-osmolality contrast media and using low-osmolality or iso-osmolality contrast media instead.
3. Minimizing the volume of contrast media used during the procedure.

Option A, checking urine sodium and risk-stratifying for CI-AKI, is not a prevention strategy but rather a way to identify patients at high risk.

Option B, delaying cardiac catheterization, may not be feasible or necessary, as the patient's symptoms and condition require prompt evaluation and treatment.

Option D, giving D5 with 150-mEq sodium bicarbonate before cardiac catheterization, is not a recommended strategy for preventing CI-AKI. While sodium bicarbonate may have some theoretical benefits, the evidence is limited, and its use is not widely accepted as a prevention strategy.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Give 0.9% sodium chloride before and after cardiac catheterization.",Success
Which ONE of the following BEST describes how medical directors can inﬂuence the culture of safety in dialysis facilities?,A,"The correct answer is A. Develop action plans to improve infection control practices, explaining the rationale of each plan with provision of feedback on the plan's impact.

As the medical director, influencing the culture of safety in a dialysis facility requires a multifaceted approach. Developing action plans to improve infection control practices, explaining the rationale behind each plan, and providing feedback on the plan's impact is a key strategy. This approach addresses the root causes of the problem, engages staff in the improvement process, and fosters a culture of accountability and transparency.

Option A aligns with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) guidelines for improving infection control practices, which emphasize the importance of developing and implementing evidence-based policies and procedures, providing education and training, and monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of these efforts.

The other options do not fully address the complexity of influencing the culture of safety:

B. While providing educational materials is important, it is only one aspect of improving infection control practices and does not necessarily address the underlying cultural issues.

C. Developing new policies and guidelines may be necessary, but it is not a sufficient strategy to influence the culture of safety.

D. Disciplinary actions and re-education may be counterproductive, as they can create a culture of fear and blame rather than encouraging open communication and accountability.

E. Designating an individual to oversee infection prevention and control techniques is important, but it is not a comprehensive strategy to influence the culture of safety.

By developing action plans, explaining the rationale, and providing feedback, medical directors can create a culture of safety that encourages staff to take ownership of infection control practices, report errors and near-misses, and continuously improve patient care.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST CORRECT answer?,D,"The correct answer is C. Advise vitamin D supplementation.

Here's why:

* The patient has end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and is on peritoneal dialysis, which increases her risk of osteoporosis.
* The DXA exam revealed a T-score of -2, indicating osteoporosis.
* However, the patient's PTH level is 58 pg/ml, which is relatively normal. Elevated PTH levels are often seen in patients with ESKD, but in this case, it's within the normal range.
* Calcium and phosphorus levels are also within normal ranges.
* Alkaline phosphatase is within normal range, which suggests no significant bone turnover.

Given this scenario, the most appropriate next step would be to advise vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with ESKD, and supplementation can help improve bone health. Additionally, vitamin D supplementation is a relatively safe and low-risk intervention.

Denosumab (Option A) and bisphosphonates (Option B) are both osteoporosis medications, but they may not be the best choices for this patient. Denosumab is not recommended for patients with severe kidney disease, and bisphosphonates can accumulate in patients with ESKD, leading to potential toxicity.

A bone biopsy (Option D) may be useful in certain situations, but it's not necessary in this case, given the patient's DXA results and normal bone turnover markers.

It's essential to note that the patient's rheumatologist should be consulted to discuss the best course of treatment, and a comprehensive plan should be developed considering the patient's overall health and medical history.",Success
Which ONE of the following is MOST likely to be associated with resistant hypertension in this man?,B,"The correct answer is B. Underlying CKD.

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure that remains above goal despite the use of three or more antihypertensive medications from different classes, optimally dosed. In this scenario, the patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which is a common cause of resistant hypertension.

CKD is a known risk factor for resistant hypertension due to several mechanisms, including:

1. Sodium retention and volume expansion
2. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
3. Increased sympathetic nervous system activity
4. Decreased renal function leading to impaired blood pressure regulation

The patient's BMI of 24 kg/m2 is within the normal range, making obesity an unlikely contributor to resistant hypertension (Option A). While age (Option C) and race (Option D) may be associated with hypertension, they are not directly related to resistant hypertension in this scenario.

According to the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology guidelines, CKD is a common comorbidity in patients with resistant hypertension, and it is essential to consider it as a potential underlying cause.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements regarding the epidemiology of hypertension is CORRECT?,D,"The correct answer is E. The prevalence of hypertension has steadily increased over the past decade.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the prevalence of hypertension in the United States has indeed increased over the past decade. As of 2020, more than 1 in 3 adults in the US have hypertension, which translates to approximately 108 million people. This trend is attributed to various factors, including the growing obesity epidemic, increased sodium consumption, and an aging population.

The other options are incorrect:

A. According to the CDC, about 80% of adults with hypertension are aware of their condition, not less than 50%.

B. While it's true that not all people with hypertension receive treatment, the CDC reports that around 75% of adults with hypertension are taking medication to lower their blood pressure.

C. Unfortunately, only about 50% of people with hypertension have their condition under control, not 75%.

D. As mentioned earlier, about 50% of people with hypertension have their condition under control, but this rate is not steadily improving.

It's essential to educate the public about hypertension, its risks, and the importance of early detection, treatment, and control to reduce the burden of this prevalent condition.",Success
Which of the following is the next BEST step in man-aging this patient?,D,"The correct answer is A. Obtain a kidney biopsy.

Here's why:

The patient presents with nephrotic syndrome, characterized by proteinuria (>3.5 g/24h), hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin <3.5 g/dl), and normal serum creatinine. The positive PLA2R antibody suggests membranous nephropathy, a common cause of nephrotic syndrome. However, a kidney biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of nephrotic syndrome.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend a kidney biopsy in patients with nephrotic syndrome to guide further management.

Initiating immunosuppressive therapy without a biopsy may not be appropriate, as it may not target the underlying pathology. Rituximab (option C) may be used in membranous nephropathy, but only after a biopsy confirms the diagnosis. Calcineurin inhibitors (option B) are not typically used as first-line therapy for membranous nephropathy.

An ACE-I (option D) may be useful in managing proteinuria and hypertension, but it is not the next best step in managing this patient.

Therefore, obtaining a kidney biopsy (option A) is the next best step in managing this patient to confirm the diagnosis and guide further treatment.",Success
"Of the following statements regarding immune check-point inhibitors, which ONE is NOT TRUE?",B,"The correct answer is D. Acute rejection rates are roughly 40% to 50% and occur within 3 weeks of treatment initiation.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab, can cause immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including colitis, thyroiditis, and rash (Option A). In this patient, the abdominal pain, diarrhea, and flare of psoriasis are consistent with irAEs.

Option B is plausible, as volume depletion and prerenal AKI can contribute to allograft dysfunction, especially in a patient with a history of kidney transplantation.

Option C is also true. A renal biopsy may not be able to distinguish acute interstitial nephritis caused by anti-PD-1 agents from transplant rejection, as both can present with similar histopathological features.

However, Option D is not accurate. Acute rejection rates in kidney transplant patients are not typically around 40% to 50%, and they often occur beyond the 3-week mark after treatment initiation. According to the American Society of Transplantation, the incidence of acute rejection within the first year after kidney transplantation is around 10% to 20%.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis of his renal disease?,A,"The correct answer is E. Primary membranous nephropathy.

Here's why:

* The presence of PLA2R antibody in the serum and hyperexpression of PLA2R antigen in the capillary loops of the kidney biopsy specimen strongly suggests primary membranous nephropathy. PLA2R is a specific antigen associated with primary membranous nephropathy, and its presence is a diagnostic marker for this condition.
* The absence of any other underlying systemic disease or malignancy, such as sarcoidosis, lung cancer, or Hodgkin disease, makes it unlikely that the membranous nephropathy is secondary to another condition.
* The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, including the nephrotic syndrome, are consistent with primary membranous nephropathy.
* SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) is less likely given the absence of other typical SLE features and the presence of PLA2R antibody, which is not typically associated with SLE.

According to the American Society of Nephrology and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, the diagnosis of primary membranous nephropathy is based on the presence of characteristic lesions on kidney biopsy, along with the detection of PLA2R antibody in the serum or PLA2R antigen in the kidney tissue.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell him has been associated with an INCREASED risk of sudden cardiac arrest in patients with ESRD?,C,"The correct answer is D. A serum potassium level > 5 mEq/L on nondialysis days.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a significant concern in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and electrolyte imbalance, particularly hyperkalemia, is a known risk factor. Elevated serum potassium levels (>5 mEq/L) on nondialysis days have been associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest in patients with ESRD.

The other options are not directly related to an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest in patients with ESRD:

A. An abnormal exercise stress test result may indicate cardiac ischemia or arrhythmias, but it is not a specific risk factor for SCD in ESRD patients.

B. Elevated serum lipid levels are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but they are not specifically linked to SCD in ESRD patients.

C. A QRS-T angle of greater than or equal to 75 degrees on signal-averaged electrocardiogram may indicate cardiac electrical instability, but its relationship to SCD in ESRD patients is not well established.

E. Ventricular premature beats on 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring may indicate cardiac arrhythmias, but they are not a specific risk factor for SCD in ESRD patients.

It's essential to note that a comprehensive risk assessment for SCD in ESRD patients should consider multiple factors, including electrolyte imbalance, cardiac function, and other comorbidities.",Success
Which ONE of the following is TRUE regarding kidneys from hepatitis C–positive donors?,D,"The correct answer is D. Accepting a kidney from hepatitis C–positive donor may help shorten the time to kidney transplantation.

Here's why:

* Option A is incorrect because the patient can receive a kidney from a donor with positive hepatitis C serology, regardless of the NAT (nucleic acid testing) result.
* Option B is incorrect because the patient's hepatitis C–negative status does not preclude him from receiving a kidney from a hepatitis C–positive donor. In fact, the CDC and UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing) guidelines suggest that hepatitis C–negative recipients can receive kidneys from hepatitis C–positive donors, especially in cases where the wait time is long, as in this patient's situation.
* Option C is incorrect because while kidneys from hepatitis C–positive donors may have a slightly higher risk of graft failure, the difference is not significant, and many studies have shown that these kidneys can have similar graft survival rates to those from hepatitis C–negative donors.

The use of kidneys from hepatitis C–positive donors has increased in recent years, particularly with the advent of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, which has been shown to be highly effective in treating hepatitis C. By accepting a kidney from a hepatitis C–positive donor, the patient may be able to shorten his wait time for transplantation, which is a significant advantage given his active lifestyle and desire for travel.",Success
Which of the following is correct regarding the treatment of lupus nephritis?,B,"The correct answer is B. Post hoc analyses suggest that patients who achieve full depletion of peripheral B cells may gain greater beneﬁt from rituximab.

Here's why:

* Option A is incorrect because the LUNAR trial actually showed that the addition of rituximab to mycophenolate mofetil and steroids did not improve outcomes compared to mycophenolate mofetil and steroids alone.
* Option C is incorrect because calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus, have been shown to be effective in the treatment of lupus nephritis, particularly in patients who are resistant to or intolerant of mycophenolate mofetil.
* Option D is incorrect because the addition of voclosporin to treatment with mycophenolate and steroids was actually associated with higher rates of remission, not similar rates, compared to mycophenolate and steroids alone.

Rituximab, a B-cell depleting agent, has been studied as a potential treatment for lupus nephritis. While the LUNAR trial did not show a significant benefit from adding rituximab to standard therapy, post hoc analyses suggested that patients who achieved full depletion of peripheral B cells may have gained greater benefit from rituximab. This highlights the importance of achieving adequate B-cell depletion in order to maximize the potential benefits of rituximab therapy.",Success
Which of the following statements is MOST COR-RECT regarding transplantation?,E,"The correct answer is E. Providing that institutional safeguards have been established and the patient’s HIV is controlled with antiretroviral therapy, he is a good candidate for transplantation.

According to current medical guidelines, HIV infection is no longer an absolute contraindication for kidney transplantation. In fact, studies have shown that HIV-infected patients can have similar outcomes to HIV-negative patients after kidney transplantation, as long as their HIV is well-controlled with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and they have a low viral load.

Option A is incorrect because while immunosuppressive medications may pose some risks for HIV-infected patients, they can be managed with careful monitoring and adjustments to ART. In fact, transplantation may be a better option for this patient than dialysis, as it can improve his overall quality of life and survival.

Option B is incorrect because while it is possible to receive an HIV-infected deceased donor kidney, this is not a guarantee, and the waiting time may be similar to that for an HIV-negative donor kidney.

Option C is incorrect because while the risks of transplantation are similar for HIV-infected and HIV-negative patients, they are not identical. HIV-infected patients may be at higher risk for certain complications, such as opportunistic infections and malignancies.

Option D is incorrect because while calcineurin inhibitors may interact with antiretroviral therapy, they are not necessarily contraindicated. In fact, many HIV-infected patients have successfully received calcineurin inhibitors after kidney transplantation with careful monitoring and adjustments to their medications.",Success
"Question 2654:
Which ONE of the following statements about use of mycophenolate after kidney transplantation is CORRECT?",A,"The correct answer is A. Dose reductions stemming from adverse effects are associated with an increased risk of rejection and graft failure.

Explanation: Mycophenolate is an immunosuppressive medication commonly used to prevent rejection in kidney transplant recipients. Dose reductions or discontinuation of mycophenolate due to adverse effects, such as gastrointestinal symptoms or cytopenias, can increase the risk of rejection and graft failure. This is because mycophenolate plays a crucial role in preventing the immune system from attacking the transplanted kidney.

The other options are incorrect:

B. The risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia is actually lower with mycophenolate compared to azathioprine (Source: KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for the Care of Kidney Transplant Recipients).

C. While mycophenolate may have some advantages over azathioprine, there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that it is associated with a reduced risk of mortality (Source: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews).

D. Physical frailty can indeed affect the frequency and severity of mycophenolate adverse events, particularly in older adults (Source: American Journal of Kidney Diseases).

E. There is no evidence to suggest that dose-limiting adverse effects are more commonly seen in living compared with deceased donor allograft recipients (Source: Transplantation Proceedings).",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely primary cause of her hypercalcemia?,A,"The correct answer is A. Primary hyperparathyroidism.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as difficulty sleeping and constipation, are consistent with hypercalcemia.
* The laboratory values show an elevated calcium level (11.4 mg/dl) and a relatively low phosphorus level (2.1 mg/dl), which is suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism.
* The 24-hour urine calcium excretion is 262 mg, which is not particularly low. In familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, urine calcium excretion is typically very low (<100 mg/24 hours).
* Thiazide-induced hypocalciuria (option C) is unlikely to be the primary cause of hypercalcemia, as the patient has been taking hydrochlorothiazide for 15 years and has only recently developed hypercalcemia.
* There is no evidence of occult malignancy (option D) based on the normal radiologic studies.
* Sarcoidosis (option E) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the absence of any other symptoms or signs suggestive of sarcoidosis, such as pulmonary or skin manifestations.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common cause of hypercalcemia in adults, and it is often asymptomatic or presents with nonspecific symptoms like the ones described in this patient. It is essential to further evaluate the patient with a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level and possibly imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis.",Success
Which ONE of the following treatment regimens would be MOST likely to reduce the rate of progression to ESRD?,D,"The correct answer is A. Aggressive use of renin-angiotensin inhibition.

IgA nephropathy is a chronic kidney disease characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies in the glomeruli, leading to inflammation and kidney damage. The Oxford-MEST-C score is a histological classification system that predicts the risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

The patient's Oxford-MEST-C score indicates moderate to high risk of progression to ESRD. Given the patient's rapid decline in kidney function (serum creatinine increased from 1.9 mg/dl to 2.8 mg/dl in just 4 days), aggressive management is necessary to slow down the progression of the disease.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for Glomerulonephritis, renin-angiotensin inhibition with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is recommended to reduce proteinuria and slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with IgA nephropathy.

The other options are not supported by current evidence:

B. A 6-month course of low-dose corticosteroids may be beneficial in reducing proteinuria, but it is not as effective as renin-angiotensin inhibition in slowing down the progression of kidney disease.

C. There is limited evidence to support the use of combined MMF plus low-dose steroids in IgA nephropathy.

D. Treatment with high-dose steroids, cyclophosphamide, and plasmapheresis is typically reserved for more severe cases of IgA nephropathy with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, which is not the case here.

E. High-dose steroids alone are not recommended as first-line therapy for IgA nephropathy.

Therefore, option A, aggressive use of renin-angiotensin inhibition, is the most likely to reduce the rate of progression to ESRD in this patient.",Success
Which of the following statements is MOST correct?,E,"The correct answer is E. Cessation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate will lead to improvement in proteinuria and hypophosphatemia.

Here's why:

* The patient is experiencing proteinuria (1.1 g/24 hours) and hypophosphatemia (serum phosphorus level of 1.9 mg/dl), which are known side effects of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).
* TDF is a nephrotoxic medication that can cause proximal tubular damage, leading to proteinuria and hypophosphatemia.
* Given the patient's long history of HIV control with undetectable viral load, it's reasonable to consider adjusting her antiretroviral regimen to minimize nephrotoxicity.
* Cessation of TDF may lead to improvement in proteinuria and hypophosphatemia, as seen in previous studies.

The other options are not correct:

* A. While the patient's antiviral medications have been effective in controlling HIV, the presence of proteinuria and hypophosphatemia suggests that TDF may need to be adjusted or replaced.
* B. Immune complex GN is possible, but kidney biopsy would be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.
* C. HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is a possibility, but it's not the most likely diagnosis given the patient's well-controlled HIV and the presence of proteinuria and hypophosphatemia, which are more consistent with TDF toxicity.
* D. PLA2R levels can help diagnose membranous nephropathy (MN), but this is not directly related to the patient's current presentation or the question being asked.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you recommend at this time?,C,"Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, I would recommend option D. Calcitonin.

The patient presents with severe hypercalcemia (serum calcium of 15.9 mg/dL) and symptoms of fatigue and generalized bone pain. The laboratory results rule out other potential causes of hypercalcemia, such as hyperparathyroidism (elevated PTH levels) or vitamin D toxicity (normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level). The patient's PTH level is within the normal range, which suggests that the hypercalcemia is not due to primary hyperparathyroidism.

Calcitonin is a medication that can help to rapidly lower calcium levels in cases of severe hypercalcemia. It works by inhibiting bone resorption and increasing calcium excretion in the urine. Given the patient's severe symptoms and laboratory results, calcitonin is a reasonable next step to help manage his hypercalcemia.

Zoledronic acid (option A) is a bisphosphonate that can also be used to treat hypercalcemia, but it may take several days to take effect, and the patient's symptoms require more immediate attention. Hemodialysis (option B) is not indicated at this time, as the patient's renal function appears to be normal. Ionized calcium (option C) is a laboratory test that can provide more information about the patient's calcium levels, but it is not a treatment option. PTH-related protein level (option E) may be helpful in diagnosing certain types of cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma, that can cause hypercalcemia, but it is not the next step in managing the patient's symptoms.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell your endocrine colleague about subtotal parathyroidectomy versus therapy with cinacalcet in renal transplant recipients?,C,"The correct answer is C. Subtotal parathyroidectomy more effectively controls hypercalcemia when compared with cinacalcet.

In renal transplant recipients with persistent hyperparathyroidism, subtotal parathyroidectomy has been shown to be more effective in controlling hypercalcemia compared to cinacalcet therapy. This is because parathyroidectomy can directly remove the source of excess parathyroid hormone (PTH) production, leading to a more sustained reduction in calcium levels. Cinacalcet, on the other hand, works by reducing PTH secretion, but may not be as effective in achieving normocalcemia, especially in patients with severe hyperparathyroidism.

The other options are not supported by current evidence:

A. Cinacalcet is not more effective in increasing serum phosphorus levels than subtotal parathyroidectomy. In fact, cinacalcet can decrease phosphorus levels by reducing PTH-mediated phosphaturia.

B. While cinacalcet can lower PTH levels, subtotal parathyroidectomy is more effective in achieving a sustained reduction in PTH levels.

D. Cinacalcet is associated with a risk of hypocalcemia, but subtotal parathyroidectomy can also cause hypocalcemia, especially in the postoperative period.

E. There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that subtotal parathyroidectomy is associated with improved patient survival compared to cinacalcet in renal transplant recipients with hyperparathyroidism.",Success
What is the next BEST step in management of this patient?,D,"The correct answer is B. Initiate a trial of prednisone therapy.

Here's why:

* The patient has a history of FSGS (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis) diagnosed by kidney biopsy 5 years ago, which is a disease that can cause proteinuria and kidney damage.
* Despite being on losartan, her proteinuria has continued to increase, and her serum creatinine has been slowly rising over the past 10 years, indicating progressive kidney disease.
* The patient has not received immunosuppressive therapy, which is a standard treatment for FSGS. Steroids, such as prednisone, are often used as first-line therapy to reduce proteinuria and slow disease progression.
* While tightening BP control is important, adding another antihypertensive agent (Option A) may not specifically address the underlying kidney disease.
* Repeating the kidney biopsy (Option C) may not provide new information, as the diagnosis of FSGS has already been established.
* Genetic testing (Option D) may be useful in some cases of FSGS, but it is not the next best step in management for this patient, as the diagnosis has already been made and treatment has not been initiated.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, steroids are recommended as initial therapy for patients with FSGS and nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, initiating a trial of prednisone therapy is the next best step in managing this patient's condition.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis?,D,"The correct answer is D. Preeclampsia.

The patient's symptoms, including new-onset hypertension, headache, and visual scotomata, are consistent with preeclampsia. The persistence of hypertension on repeat testing and the presence of visual symptoms, such as scotomata, are particularly concerning for preeclampsia. While the patient's laboratory results are normal, this does not rule out preeclampsia, as it is a clinical diagnosis.

Gestational hypertension (Option A) is a possibility, but the presence of visual symptoms and headache make preeclampsia a more likely diagnosis. Migraine headache (Option B) is unlikely given the patient's hypertension and other symptoms. Central venous thrombosis (Option C) is not supported by the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), preeclampsia is diagnosed based on the presence of hypertension and one or more of the following: thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, impaired liver function, pulmonary edema, or cerebral or visual symptoms. In this case, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with preeclampsia.",Success
The advanced practice provider asks about outcomes and the impact of using IV iron in combination with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) Which ONE of the following should you tell the advanced practice provider about the anemia-related and non–anemia-related effects of ESAs and iron therapy in patients undergoing HD?,C,"The correct answer is B. Epidemiologic data suggest that the trend toward lower use of ESAs is associated with improved all-cause mortality in patients with ESRD.

Here's why:

* The use of IV iron in combination with ESAs has been shown to improve anemia management in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). IV iron helps to increase the response to ESAs, reducing the need for higher ESA doses.
* Studies have demonstrated that maintenance IV iron therapy is associated with a reduction in ESA use, which can lead to improved outcomes. (Option A is incorrect)
* Epidemiologic data suggest that lower ESA use is associated with improved all-cause mortality in patients with ESRD. This is because high ESA doses have been linked to increased mortality, cardiovascular events, and stroke. (Option B is correct)
* There is no evidence to suggest that maintenance IV iron is not associated with a greater likelihood of achieving hemoglobin levels between 10 and 12 g/dl. In fact, IV iron helps to improve hemoglobin response to ESAs. (Option C is incorrect)
* There is no significant difference in infectious mortality between iron sucrose and ferrous gluconate in patients with ESRD. (Option D is incorrect)
* The association between ESA use and cancer is still a topic of debate, and the evidence suggests that high ESA doses may increase the risk of cancer, particularly in patients with a history of cancer. (Option E is incorrect)

It's essential to consider the patient's individual needs and response to therapy when managing anemia in ESRD patients on HD. The advanced practice provider should be aware of the benefits and risks of ESA and iron therapy to make informed decisions about the patient's care.",Success
Which ONE of the following choices for treatment is MOST correct for this patient?,C,"The correct answer is B. Initiate therapy with intravenous pulse methylprednisolone at 1 g/d for 3 days followed by oral prednisone at 1 mg/kg per day and intravenous cyclophosphamide at 1 g/m2 six times or oral cyclophosphamide at 2 mg/kg per day.

This patient's diagnosis is likely ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), specifically granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), given the presence of anti-myeloperoxidase-ANCA and crescentic necrotizing glomerulonephritis (GN) on kidney biopsy. The patient's age and lack of extrarenal symptoms do not preclude aggressive treatment, as AAV can be life-threatening if left untreated.

The recommended treatment for AAV is a combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy, specifically cyclophosphamide, as outlined in choice B. This regimen is based on evidence from clinical trials and guidelines from organizations such as the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).

Reducing the doses of cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids by 20% or more (option C) may not be sufficient to induce remission and may increase the risk of treatment failure. Mycophenolate mofetil (option D) is not a recommended first-line treatment for AAV. Corticosteroids alone (option A) may not be sufficient to control the disease, and the patient may require additional immunosuppressive therapy to achieve remission.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements is CORRECT?,C,"The correct answer is A. He should be prescribed paricalcitol to decrease PTH.

This patient has hyperparathyroidism, as evidenced by the elevated serum PTH level (246 pg/ml, which is above the reference range of 12-72 pg/ml). The elevated calcium level (11.2 mg/dl) is likely a result of the hyperparathyroidism. 

In this scenario, the patient has secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic kidney disease, which has persisted after kidney transplantation. The goal is to manage the hyperparathyroidism to prevent bone disease and other complications.

Paricalcitol, a vitamin D analog, is an appropriate treatment option to decrease PTH levels in this patient. It has been shown to effectively reduce PTH levels and improve bone health in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Option B is incorrect because tertiary hyperparathyroidism is a rare condition that occurs when secondary hyperparathyroidism persists despite correction of the underlying cause (in this case, kidney transplantation). While the patient's PTH level is elevated, there is no indication that he has tertiary hyperparathyroidism, and parathyroidectomy is not warranted at this time.

Option C is incorrect because cinacalcet therapy is not typically used as a first-line treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism, and its effectiveness in achieving remission of hyperparathyroidism is not well established.

Option D is incorrect because cinacalcet therapy is not expected to lower serum phosphorus levels further. Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent that acts on the calcium-sensing receptor to decrease PTH secretion, but it does not directly affect phosphorus levels.",Success
"In addition to adequate preoperative combined alpha- and beta-blockade before surgery, which ONE of the following is the next MOST appropriate step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Genetic testing.

Given the diagnosis of paraganglioma, genetic testing is the next most appropriate step in management. Paragangliomas can be associated with genetic syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), von Hippel-Lindau disease, and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex mutations. Identifying a genetic mutation can help guide further management, including screening for other associated tumors and counseling family members.

While 123-I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy (Option A) may be useful in localizing the tumor and detecting metastases, it is not the next most appropriate step in management. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) (Option B) may also be used for tumor localization and staging, but it is not as high a priority as genetic testing at this point. Urine catecholamines (Option D) have already been elevated, leading to the diagnosis, and repeating this test is not the next most important step.

It's essential to note that adequate preoperative combined alpha- and beta-blockade before surgery is crucial to prevent perioperative complications related to catecholamine release. However, genetic testing is the next most appropriate step in management to guide further care and potential screening for associated conditions.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?,D,"The correct answer is D. Assess whether continuing dialysis is less detrimental than withholding treatment.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI), the presence of bacteria in the dialysate (300 CFU/mL) indicates a potential risk for pyrogenic reactions or sepsis in patients. However, the decision to continue or discontinue dialysis should be based on a risk-benefit assessment.

In this scenario, it is essential to weigh the potential risks of continuing dialysis with the potential benefits of continuing treatment. If the patient's condition is critical and requires ongoing dialysis, it may be more detrimental to withhold treatment. On the other hand, if the patient's condition is stable, it may be safer to discontinue dialysis and address the bacterial contamination issue.

The other options are not the most appropriate management strategies:

A. Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended in this scenario, as the bacterial contamination is in the dialysate, not in the patient.

B. Immediately discontinuing dialysis and ordering blood cultures may be premature, as the risk-benefit assessment should be performed first.

C. Decreasing dialysate and blood flow rates may not effectively address the bacterial contamination issue and could potentially compromise the effectiveness of the dialysis treatment.

E. Changing to a different hemodialysis machine with a new dialyzer and blood line may not be necessary, as the contamination is in the distribution loop, not in the machine or dialyzer.",Success
"When you explain to him what you are thinking about his BP, which of the following statements would most accurately summarize his current situation?",C,"The correct answer is C. “Now that you have had a heart attack, your body is showing us that it is vulnerable to things like an elevated BP, and we really need to work hard to get this under control soon.”

This statement accurately summarizes the patient's current situation because:

* As a patient with a history of heart attack and percutaneous coronary intervention, he is at high risk for future cardiovascular events.
* Elevated BP is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and uncontrolled hypertension can lead to further cardiac damage and increased morbidity.
* The patient's recent lack of healthcare engagement and loss of health benefits may have contributed to his uncontrolled BP, and it's essential to address this issue promptly.
* The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend a BP goal of <130/80 mmHg for patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, such as this patient.

Option A is incorrect because it downplays the importance of controlling BP after a heart attack. Option B is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that lowering diastolic BP too much would cause another heart attack. Option D is incorrect because the recommended BP goal is not based on the patient's age, and the current systolic BP of 163 mmHg is above the recommended target.",Success
Recent studies would suggest which ONE of the following as the BEST clinical approach to her care?,B,"The correct answer is B. Observation on a twice-a-year schedule.

The patient's presentation is consistent with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), which is a common endocrine disorder characterized by elevated serum calcium levels and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The patient's PTH level of 78 pg/ml is slightly elevated, and the 24-hour urine calcium excretion of 246 mg is within the normal range.

According to the 2014 Guidelines for the Management of Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism, published by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), the recommended approach for asymptomatic patients with mild hypercalcemia (serum calcium < 11.0 mg/dl) is observation with regular monitoring of serum calcium and PTH levels every 6-12 months.

Parathyroidectomy (Option A) is typically reserved for patients with more severe hypercalcemia, symptoms, or complications such as kidney stones, osteoporosis, or renal impairment. Cinacalcet (Option C) is a calcimimetic agent that may be used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism, but it is not typically used as first-line therapy for asymptomatic PHPT. Estrogen therapy (Option D) is not indicated for the treatment of PHPT, and denosumab (Option E) is a medication used to treat osteoporosis, not PHPT.

Therefore, the best clinical approach for this patient would be observation on a twice-a-year schedule, with regular monitoring of serum calcium and PTH levels to ensure that the patient remains asymptomatic and that the hypercalcemia does not worsen over time.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell him regarding lead exposure and kidney disease?,C,"The correct answer is C. Even mild elevations in blood lead levels among adults have been associated with an increased risk of CKD.

This answer is supported by evidence-based practices and current medical guidelines. Lead exposure has been linked to kidney disease, and even low-level exposure can increase the risk of CKD. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) recommend considering lead exposure as a potential contributing factor in patients with CKD, especially those with a history of occupational exposure.

Option A is incorrect because while very high whole blood lead levels (>1000 mg/L) are associated with lead nephropathy, even lower levels can contribute to CKD.

Option B is incorrect because prior lead exposure has been linked to both gout and CKD. Lead can increase uric acid production, leading to gout, and also cause kidney damage and CKD.

Option D is incorrect because the presence or absence of overt proteinuria does not rule out lead exposure as a contributing factor to CKD. The patient's urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio indicate significant kidney damage, and lead exposure should still be considered as a potential contributing factor.",Success
Which of the following statements is correct regarding recent trends in deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) or years of ill health globally due to hypertension?,D,"The correct answer is:

C. Both overall number and age-standardized rates of deaths and disability related to hypertension continued to rise between years 2007 and 2017

According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, hypertension was the leading risk factor for mortality and disability globally, accounting for approximately 10.4 million deaths and 218 million DALYs in 2017. Between 2007 and 2017, the number of deaths and DALYs due to hypertension increased, and the age-standardized rates of deaths and DALYs also continued to rise.

This trend is concerning, as it suggests that the global burden of hypertension is not decreasing, despite efforts to control and manage the condition. The increasing prevalence of hypertension, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, is a major contributor to this trend.

Which ONE of the following should you tell your colleague about the expected prognosis of transplanting this kidney?,D,"The correct answer is C. The finding of fibrin thrombi on biopsy is associated with > 10% lower allograft survival at 1 year.

Here's why:

* Option A is incorrect because the presence of premortem AKI in the donor kidney increases the risk of delayed graft function (DGF) in the recipient. Studies have shown that AKI in the donor is a significant risk factor for DGF, which can impact short-term and long-term graft outcomes.
* Option B is incorrect because while the presence of fibrin thrombi on biopsy is a concern, it does not guarantee DGF. However, it does increase the risk of DGF and may impact allograft survival.
* Option D is incorrect because AKI in the donor kidney can affect allograft function at 1 year. Studies have shown that donor AKI is associated with decreased graft survival and increased risk of graft failure.

The presence of fibrin thrombi on biopsy is a concerning finding, as it may indicate endothelial damage and microvascular injury. This can impact allograft function and survival. While the absence of glomerulosclerosis is reassuring, the fibrin thrombi finding suggests that the kidney may have some degree of microvascular injury, which could affect its function after transplantation.

It's essential to discuss the potential risks and benefits of transplanting this kidney with your nephrology colleague and the patient, considering the patient's overall health, dialysis vintage, and other comorbidities.",Success
"Of the following, which is the best agent for his osteoporosis?",C,"Based on the patient's medical history and current lab results, I would recommend option B: Denosumab.

Here's my reasoning:

* The patient has a history of fractures, including a nontraumatic vertebral fracture, indicating osteoporosis.
* He has been taking glucocorticoids for years, which can contribute to osteoporosis.
* His PTH level is 120 pg/ml, which is slightly elevated, but not severely so.
* His bone-specific alkaline phosphatase is low, suggesting low bone turnover.
* He is not taking phosphate binders, and his phosphorus levels are normal.

Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits RANKL, a protein involved in osteoclast activation and bone resorption. It is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in patients at high risk of fracture, such as those with a history of vertebral fractures. Denosumab has been shown to reduce the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures in patients with osteoporosis.

Pamidronate (option A) is a bisphosphonate, which can also be used to treat osteoporosis. However, it may not be the best choice for this patient due to his CKD stage 4 and potential risk of nephrotoxicity associated with bisphosphonates.

Teriparatide (option C) is a recombinant PTH analogue that stimulates bone formation. While it can be used to treat osteoporosis, it may not be the best choice for this patient due to his history of vertebral fractures and potential risk of worsening vertebral fractures with teriparatide use.

Romosozumab (option D) is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits sclerostin, a protein involved in bone formation. While it has been approved for the treatment of osteoporosis, it may not be the best choice for this patient due to his low bone turnover state, as indicated by his low bone-specific alkaline phosphatase level.

Overall, denosumab is a reasonable choice for this patient due to its ability to inhibit bone resorption and reduce the risk of fractures, while also being relatively safe in patients with CKD.",Success
"With regard to drug-induced metabolic acidosis, which of the following is correct?",C,"The correct answer is A. Topiramate is associated with urine crystals and with crystalline stone formation.

Here's why:

* Topiramate, an anticonvulsant, can cause metabolic acidosis by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase, leading to increased urinary bicarbonate loss and subsequent acidosis. Additionally, topiramate has been associated with the formation of urine crystals and kidney stones, which is a rare but important complication.
* Valproate (option B) is indeed highly protein-bound, but it can be removed with hemodialysis, especially in cases of overdose or toxicity.
* There is no clear evidence to suggest that concomitant antibiotic use increases the risk of pyroglutamic acidosis from acetaminophen use (option C).
* Linezolid (option D) can cause lactic acidosis, which is a type of metabolic acidosis, but it does not block carbonic anhydrase. Linezolid-induced lactic acidosis is thought to be related to its inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis.

In the context of the patient with zidovudine-induced metabolic acidosis, it's essential to recognize that certain medications can cause metabolic acidosis through various mechanisms. As a medical assistant, it's crucial to be aware of these potential adverse effects and to educate residents on the importance of monitoring patients for signs of acidosis, especially when prescribing medications with known acid-base disturbances.",Success
"Question 2638:
Which ONE of the following patients is at an increased risk for profound metabolic alkalosis and hypovolemia in response to hydrochlorothiazide?",C,"The correct answer is C. An 18-year-old woman with sensorineural hearing loss and goiter.

This patient is likely to have Gitelman syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypokalemic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria. Gitelman syndrome is often associated with sensorineural hearing loss and goiter. Hydrochlorothiazide can exacerbate the underlying electrolyte imbalance in these patients, leading to profound metabolic alkalosis and hypovolemia.

In contrast, patients with glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA) (Option A) may have hypertension, but they are not at increased risk for metabolic alkalosis and hypovolemia with hydrochlorothiazide.

Liddle syndrome (Option B) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. However, these patients are not typically at increased risk for profound metabolic alkalosis and hypovolemia with hydrochlorothiazide.

The 74-year-old woman with hypertension (Option D) may be at risk for volume depletion with hydrochlorothiazide, but she is not at increased risk for profound metabolic alkalosis and hypovolemia compared to the patient with Gitelman syndrome.",Success
Addition of which ONE of the following would you recommend to decrease this man’s long-term risk of AKI and hepatorenal syndrome?,A,"The correct answer is A. Norflaxacin or rifaximin.

This patient has a history of cirrhosis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and transient AKI, which puts him at risk for developing hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Norfloxacin or rifaximin are antibiotics that can help prevent bacterial infections, particularly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which is a common complication of cirrhosis. By preventing infections, these antibiotics can decrease the risk of AKI and HRS.

Norfloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is commonly used to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in patients with cirrhosis. Rifaximin is a non-absorbed antibiotic that has been shown to reduce the risk of HRS and improve survival in patients with cirrhosis.

The other options are not directly related to preventing AKI and HRS in this patient:

B. Carvedilol is a beta blocker that may be used to treat portal hypertension, but it is not specifically indicated for preventing AKI and HRS.

C. Pentoxifylline is a medication that may be used to treat acute kidney injury, but it is not a preventative measure for HRS.

D. Midodrine is a vasopressor that may be used to treat hypotension, but it is not indicated for preventing AKI and HRS.

It's important to note that this patient should also receive other evidence-based treatments to prevent AKI and HRS, such as volume expansion with albumin, and vasoconstrictors like terlipressin or noradrenaline, under the guidance of a healthcare provider.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the BEST choice of renal replacement therapy (RRT) for this patient?,C,"The correct answer is C. Continuous renal replacement therapy (RRT).

This patient is critically ill with a hemorrhagic stroke, increased intracranial pressure, and oliguric acute kidney injury (AKI) complicated by sepsis and pneumonia. He requires close hemodynamic monitoring and management.

Continuous RRT (CRRT) is the best choice for this patient because it:

1. Allows for slow and gentle removal of fluids and solutes, which is important in a patient with increased intracranial pressure.
2. Provides better hemodynamic stability compared to intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) or intermittent hemodiafiltration (IHF), which can cause sudden changes in blood pressure and volume.
3. Can be performed continuously, allowing for more efficient removal of uremic toxins and better control of electrolyte and acid-base balance.
4. Is less likely to cause disequilibrium syndrome, which can occur with IHD or IHF, particularly in patients with cerebral edema.

The American Society of Nephrology and the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend CRRT as the preferred modality for RRT in critically ill patients with AKI, especially those with hemodynamic instability or increased intracranial pressure.",Success
"In addition to discontinuing warfarin, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate in the management of this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Reversal of INR to < 1.3 plus lowering of systolic BP < 160 mmHg within 4 hours.

The patient has a left-sided frontal lobe hemorrhage, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt management. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines recommend that, in patients with warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage, the INR should be reversed to <1.3 as quickly as possible, and ideally within 4 hours. This can be achieved with vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma, or prothrombin complex concentrates.

In addition to INR reversal, blood pressure control is crucial in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. The same guidelines recommend that, in patients with systolic blood pressure >180 mmHg, it should be lowered to <160 mmHg within 4 hours. This can be achieved with antihypertensive medications such as nicardipine, labetalol, or hydralazine.

Therefore, option C is the most appropriate management strategy for this patient, as it addresses both INR reversal and blood pressure control.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the BEST choice of renal replacement therapy for this man on the basis of the most recent Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines?,B,"The correct answer is B. Continuous RRT (24 h/day).

According to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is recommended for patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) who require close monitoring and tight volume control, such as those with traumatic brain injury and elevated intracranial pressure.

In this scenario, the patient has a traumatic subdural hematoma, is undergoing continuous monitoring of intracranial pressure, and has decreased urine output, indicating AKI. The laboratory studies show signs of kidney injury, including elevated creatinine and BUN, and the urinalysis reveals muddy brown casts, which are indicative of acute tubular necrosis.

The KDIGO guidelines recommend CRRT over intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) in patients with AKI who require close volume control, as CRRT allows for more precise control of fluid removal and electrolyte management. Additionally, CRRT is preferred over IHD in patients with hemodynamic instability, which is a concern in this patient given his traumatic brain injury and need for intracranial pressure monitoring.

Option B, Continuous RRT (24 h/day), is the best choice for this patient, as it provides continuous removal of waste products and allows for tight volume control, which is essential in managing his intracranial pressure and preventing further complications.",Success
What is the best advice at this point?,C,"The correct answer is C. Start him with expulsive medical therapy (tamsulosin) and get a follow-up for him with a urologist over the next week to evaluate further therapy.

Rationale:

The patient has an obstructing 4-mm stone at the left ureterovesical junction, and the pain persists when not taking analgesics. The goal is to facilitate stone passage and manage symptoms. Expulsive medical therapy with tamsulosin, an alpha-blocker, has been shown to increase the likelihood of spontaneous stone passage and reduce the time to passage (1). It is a reasonable first step in managing this patient's condition.

While it's essential to assess stone risk factors, repeating blood tests and ordering a 24-hour urine collection (Option A) can be done at a later stage, but it's not the most urgent priority at this point.

Option B, advising the patient to go back to the emergency department for an urgent urologist consultation, may not be necessary, as the patient is already being seen in the clinic and can be managed with expulsive medical therapy.

Option D, advising the patient to drink plenty of water, move around, cut down on high-protein dietary intake, and return in 2 weeks, is a good long-term strategy for stone prevention, but it doesn't address the patient's current symptoms and the need for active management of the obstructing stone.

Option E, starting antibiotics to prevent superimposed infection, is not indicated, as there is no evidence of infection (no fever, normal urinalysis).

Which ONE of the following should you tell her about probiotics and alterations of the microbiome in patients on dialysis?,D,"The correct answer is D. Diabetic ESRD patients who received pro-biotics containing lactobacillus were found to have decreased fasting serum glucose and serum insulin, along with increased insulin sensitivity.

Research suggests that alterations in the gut microbiome may contribute to the accumulation of uremic toxins in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Probiotics, which modify the gut microbiome, have been studied as a potential therapeutic approach to reduce uremic toxins and improve symptoms.

Option D is supported by a study that found that diabetic ESRD patients who received probiotics containing lactobacillus had improved glucose metabolism, including decreased fasting serum glucose and serum insulin, as well as increased insulin sensitivity.

Option A is incorrect because oral vancomycin is not typically used to suppress gut bacteria in dialysis patients, and its effect on tryptophan and tyrosine degradation is not directly related to uremic toxin accumulation.

Option B is incorrect because oral vancomycin is actually known to disrupt the gut microbiome, leading to a decrease in diversity, rather than an increase.

Option C is incorrect because while uremic toxins can affect the gut microbiome, there is no evidence to suggest that they induce the enzyme transketolase, leading to functional thiamine deficiency.

It's essential to discuss the potential benefits and limitations of probiotics with the patient, including the current evidence and any potential interactions with her medications or dialysis treatment.",Success
Which of the following is an absolute contraindication for hyperbaric oxygen therapy?,A,"The correct answer is A. Untreated pneumothorax.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is contraindicated in patients with an untreated pneumothorax because the increased pressure can cause the pneumothorax to expand, leading to respiratory failure or even death. HBOT can also cause the air in the pneumothorax to expand, making it more difficult to treat.

Claustrophobia (option B) is a relative contraindication, as it may cause anxiety or discomfort during the HBOT treatment, but it is not an absolute contraindication. Patients with claustrophobia can be managed with sedation, relaxation techniques, or other anxiety-reducing measures.

Sinus infections (option C) are not an absolute contraindication for HBOT, but they may require additional precautions, such as decongestant therapy, to prevent sinus damage from the pressure changes.

Diabetes mellitus (option D) is not a contraindication for HBOT. In fact, HBOT has been shown to be beneficial in wound healing, particularly in patients with diabetic foot ulcers.

In this case, the patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus is not a contraindication for HBOT, and the clinical team can consider starting HBOT to facilitate wound healing, as long as there are no other absolute contraindications present.",Success
Which ONE of this patient’s clinical parameters is associated with the GREATEST risk of fracture after transplantation?,B,"The correct answer is C. The serum PTH level.

The patient's elevated serum PTH level (172 pg/ml) is a significant risk factor for fracture after kidney transplantation. Secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is common in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), can lead to bone resorption and increased fracture risk. The elevated PTH level in this patient indicates that she has secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is a major concern for fracture risk after transplantation.

The other options are not directly associated with the greatest risk of fracture after transplantation:

A. The procollagen type-1 N-terminal propeptide level is a marker of bone formation, and a level within the reference range (16-96 µg/L) suggests that bone formation is not significantly impaired.

B. Omeprazole therapy may increase the risk of osteoporosis and fracture, but this risk is relatively low compared to the patient's elevated PTH level.

D. The results of dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) show normal bone density, which suggests that the patient does not have osteoporosis at this time. However, this does not rule out the risk of fracture due to secondary hyperparathyroidism.

E. The serum alkaline phosphatase level is slightly elevated, but this is not a strong predictor of fracture risk in this patient.

It's essential to address the patient's secondary hyperparathyroidism before transplantation to minimize the risk of fracture. This may involve managing her PTH level through medication, dietary changes, or other interventions.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate initial management strategy?,C,"The correct answer is C. Empiric therapy with prednisone and azathioprine, followed by adjusted treatment after delivery based on kidney biopsy performed postpartum.

This patient presents with new-onset proteinuria, hematuria, and hypertension during pregnancy, which suggests a diagnosis of lupus nephritis. The positive antinuclear antibody, anti-dsDNA antibodies, and low serum C3 and C4 levels support this diagnosis. The bilateral hydronephrosis on kidney ultrasound may indicate underlying kidney disease.

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, empiric therapy with prednisone and azathioprine is the most appropriate initial management strategy. This treatment aims to control the lupus flare and prevent further kidney damage. After delivery, a kidney biopsy can be performed to guide further treatment and management.

Option A is incorrect because while bilateral hydronephrosis is present, there is no indication of acute obstruction requiring urgent ureteral stent placement.

Option B is incorrect because immediate induction of labor is not necessary, and betamethasone for fetal maturation is not indicated at this gestational age.

Option D is incorrect because supportive management alone may not adequately address the underlying lupus nephritis, and delaying treatment may lead to further kidney damage. Induction of delivery at term without treating the underlying condition may not be sufficient to prevent long-term kidney damage.",Success
Which ONE of his medications should not be coprescribed with clarithromycin to avoid an increased risk of AKI?,B,"The correct answer is A. Lisinopril.

Clarithromycin is a strong inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system and can increase the levels of certain medications, including ACE inhibitors like lisinopril. This can lead to increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) due to decreased renal perfusion.

The American Geriatrics Society and the National Kidney Foundation recommend avoiding the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics like clarithromycin in patients with CKD, especially in older adults.

There is no significant interaction between clarithromycin and pravastatin, carvedilol, or metformin that would increase the risk of AKI. However, it's essential to monitor the patient's renal function and adjust medications as needed during and after treatment with clarithromycin.

Which of the following proteins regulate calcium excretion and have been associated with increased stone risk?,B,"The correct answer is C. Klotho.

Klotho is a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in regulating calcium excretion in the kidneys. It has been associated with increased risk of nephrolithiasis, particularly calcium oxalate stones. Klotho deficiency has been linked to hypercalciuria, which is a common risk factor for kidney stone formation.

Polycystin 2 (Option A) is associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys. While ADPKD can increase the risk of kidney stones, polycystin 2 is not directly involved in calcium excretion.

Claudin (Option B) is a family of transmembrane proteins involved in tight junction formation and epithelial cell-cell adhesion. While claudins play a role in kidney function, they are not directly related to calcium excretion or kidney stone risk.

FGF23 (Option D) is a hormone involved in phosphate homeostasis and vitamin D regulation. While FGF23 dysregulation can contribute to kidney stone formation, it is not directly involved in calcium excretion.

In this patient's case, the high urine calcium level suggests a potential issue with calcium excretion, making Klotho a relevant protein to consider in the evaluation of his recurrent nephrolithiasis.",Success
"At this point, which ONE of the following would you recommend for treatment of this woman’s hypercalcemia?",A,"Based on the patient's history and laboratory results, I would recommend option B: Calcitonin.

The patient's hypercalcemia is likely caused by the excessive production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by the granulomas in her sarcoidosis, which is not responsive to PTH regulation. The patient has already been treated with prednisone, which has improved her acute kidney injury and hypercalcemia, but has also led to significant side effects such as weight gain, hyperglycemia, and a Cushingoid appearance.

Calcitonin is a hormone that can help lower calcium levels by inhibiting bone resorption and increasing calcium excretion in the urine. It is often used in the treatment of hypercalcemia, particularly in cases where the hypercalcemia is caused by excessive vitamin D production, as in this patient's case. Calcitonin has a rapid onset of action and can be effective in reducing calcium levels within hours.

Zoledronic acid (option A) is a bisphosphonate that can also be used to treat hypercalcemia, but it may take several days to take effect and may not be as effective in this patient's case, given the underlying vitamin D-mediated hypercalcemia.

Denosumab (option C) is a monoclonal antibody that targets RANKL, a protein involved in osteoclast activation, and is used to treat osteoporosis and hypercalcemia of malignancy. However, it may not be effective in this patient's case, as her hypercalcemia is not related to osteoclastic activity.

Phenytoin (option D) is an anticonvulsant medication that can sometimes be used to treat hypercalcemia, but it is not a first-line treatment and may have significant side effects.

Cinacalcet (option E) is a calcimimetic agent that targets the calcium-sensing receptor and is used to treat hyperparathyroidism-related hypercalcemia. However, it is not likely to be effective in this patient's case, as her hypercalcemia is not related to PTH dysregulation.

Therefore, calcitonin is the most appropriate treatment option for this patient's hypercalcemia at this point.",Success
Which ONE of the following factors or ﬁndings noted in this patient has been found to be MOST strongly associated with incident peripheral artery disease?,A,"The correct answer is A. His elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.

Elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has been consistently associated with an increased risk of peripheral artery disease (PAD). hs-CRP is a marker of systemic inflammation, and chronic inflammation is thought to play a key role in the development and progression of PAD. Studies have shown that elevated hs-CRP levels are independently associated with an increased risk of incident PAD, even after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

The other options are not as strongly associated with incident PAD:

B. Serum calcium levels are not typically associated with PAD.

C. Moderate alcohol consumption (1-2 drinks per day) may actually have a protective effect on cardiovascular disease, but the evidence is not strong enough to suggest a specific association with PAD.

D. Low educational status is a socioeconomic factor that may be associated with increased cardiovascular risk, but it is not a direct risk factor for PAD.

E. While race/ethnicity can affect the risk of PAD, with African Americans being at higher risk, the patient's white race is not a strong risk factor for PAD in this scenario.

It's essential to note that this patient has multiple risk factors for PAD, including diabetes, hypertension, and elevated hs-CRP, which should be addressed in his overall management plan.",Success
In which ONE of the following situations is withdrawal of therapy BEST supported?,D,"The correct answer is D. The patient had moderately severe MPO-ANCA–associated nephritis, received induction therapy with oral cyclophosphamide, and became ANCA negative when maintenance therapy was initiated.

According to the 2020 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Glomerulonephritis, patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis who achieve remission and become ANCA negative may be considered for tapering or discontinuing immunosuppressive therapy. This is particularly true for patients with MPO-ANCA–associated disease, which tends to have a lower relapse rate compared to PR3-ANCA–associated disease.

In this scenario, the patient has moderately severe MPO-ANCA–associated nephritis, received appropriate induction therapy with oral cyclophosphamide, and became ANCA negative when maintenance therapy was initiated. This suggests that the patient has responded well to treatment and is at lower risk of relapse. Therefore, withdrawing therapy may be considered in this situation.

In contrast, option A is not a reliable indicator of low relapse risk, as even patients with mild disease can experience relapse. Option B suggests that the patient remains PR3-ANCA positive, which is a risk factor for relapse, making withdrawal of therapy less advisable. Option C indicates that the patient became ANCA positive again, which suggests ongoing disease activity and a higher risk of relapse, making withdrawal of therapy premature.",Success
"Question 2824:
The transfusion of longer-term stored packed red blood cells compared with fresher blood has been associated with which ONE of the following?",B,"The correct answer is D. Increased risk of AKI requiring RRT.

According to current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices, the transfusion of longer-term stored packed red blood cells has been associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) (1, 2).

A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that the use of older red blood cells was associated with an increased risk of AKI and RRT (1). Another study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2018 also found that the transfusion of older red blood cells was associated with an increased risk of AKI and mortality (2).

The other options are not supported by current evidence:

A. There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that longer-term stored packed red blood cells increase the risk of transfusion-related reactions.

B. A 2015 randomized controlled trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine found no difference in 90-day mortality between patients who received fresher or older red blood cells (3).

C. There is no evidence to suggest that longer-term stored packed red blood cells decrease the number of RRT-free days within 28 days of transfusion.

E. There is no evidence to suggest that longer-term stored packed red blood cells decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation.

Which ONE of the following INCREASES her risk of ESRD after donation?,C,"The correct answer is C. Age > 50 years.

According to the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Nephrology, older age is a risk factor for developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after kidney donation. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that kidney donors over the age of 50 had a higher risk of ESRD compared to younger donors.

Female sex (Option A) is not a significant risk factor for ESRD after kidney donation. In fact, some studies suggest that female donors may have a lower risk of ESRD compared to male donors.

The relationship to the recipient (Option B) does not increase the risk of ESRD after donation.

A BMI of 25 kg/m2 (Option D) is considered overweight, but it is not a significant risk factor for ESRD after kidney donation. However, obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) may be a contraindication to kidney donation due to the increased risk of perioperative complications and potential long-term health consequences.

It's essential to carefully evaluate the potential risks and benefits of kidney donation for this 59-year-old woman, considering her age and other health factors, to ensure that she is fully informed and able to make an educated decision.",Success
Which ONE of the following measures should be included in the policies of your outpatient dialysis center?,D,"The correct answer is C. Hand hygiene after removal of gloves and other personal protective equipment.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), hand hygiene is a crucial measure to prevent the transmission of infections in healthcare settings, including outpatient dialysis centers. The CDC recommends that healthcare workers perform hand hygiene after removing gloves and other personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent the spread of pathogens.

Option A is incorrect because isolation of patients who test positive for hepatitis C antibody is not necessary, as hepatitis C is not transmitted through casual contact. Instead, standard precautions should be followed to prevent transmission of hepatitis C and other bloodborne pathogens.

Option B is incorrect because product water for dialysate should meet the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standards, which require a microbial count of < 200 CFU/mL, not < 50 CFU.

Option D is incorrect because while interdisciplinary team meetings are important for patient care, they are not required to be held monthly with every patient. The frequency and scope of these meetings should be determined based on individual patient needs and care plans.

By including hand hygiene after removal of gloves and other PPE in the policies of your outpatient dialysis center, you can help prevent the transmission of infections and ensure a safe environment for patients and staff.",Success
Which of the following is correct with regard to PLA2R-negative MN?,C,"The correct answer is C. Thrombospondin type 1 domain containing 7A (THSD7A)–associated MN is associated with high rates of underlying malignancy.

Here's why:

* PLA2R-negative membranous nephropathy (MN) accounts for approximately 20-40% of all MN cases. In these cases, other causes of MN should be explored.
* Thrombospondin type 1 domain containing 7A (THSD7A) is a protein that has been identified as a potential antigen in PLA2R-negative MN. Research suggests that THSD7A-associated MN is associated with high rates of underlying malignancy, particularly in older adults.
* The other options are not correct:
	+ A. Exostosin 1/exostosin 2 (EXT1/EXT2) staining on renal biopsy specimens is not specifically associated with underlying malignancy in PLA2R-negative MN.
	+ B. Neural epidermal growth factor like 1 protein (NELL-1)–associated MN is a rare cause of primary MN, but it is not a common cause of PLA2R-negative MN in the elderly.
	+ D. Semaphorin 3B is not a known cause of PLA2R-negative MN, and there is no evidence to suggest it is a common cause in the elderly.

It's essential to note that the patient has already undergone a thorough evaluation for underlying malignancy with negative results. Further evaluation and testing may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's MN.",Success
"In addition to discontinuing warfarin and doxercalciferol, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management strategy for this woman?",D,"The correct answer is D. Add sodium thiosulfate.

The patient has calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), a rare but serious complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). CUA is characterized by calcification of small and medium-sized arteries, leading to ischemic pain and skin lesions. The patient's symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with CUA.

Sodium thiosulfate has been shown to be effective in treating CUA by chelating calcium and reducing tissue calcification. It is recommended as a first-line treatment for CUA in patients with ESRD.

Discontinuing warfarin and doxercalciferol is also appropriate, as they can contribute to calcification. However, adding cinacalcet (A) may not be effective in this case, as it is primarily used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is not the primary issue here. Parathyroidectomy (B) may be considered in the future if the patient's hyperparathyroidism is not well-controlled, but it is not the most immediate priority. Wide excision of the abdominal lesion (C) may not be necessary, as the primary goal is to treat the underlying CUA, and surgical excision may not address the underlying calcification process.

It's essential to note that the patient's ESRD, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation should be managed concurrently, but the primary focus should be on treating the CUA to alleviate her symptoms and prevent further complications.",Success
Which ONE of the following interventions has the GREATEST potential to reduce his risk of repeat percutaneous intervention or myocardial infarction over the next 3 years?,B,"The correct answer is B. Coronary artery bypass surgery.

According to the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is recommended for patients with three-vessel disease and decreased left ventricular function (ejection fraction <50%), as in this case. CABG has been shown to reduce the risk of repeat percutaneous intervention or myocardial infarction over the next 3 years compared to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting.

While PCI with stenting (options A and C) may provide some benefit, CABG has been consistently shown to have better long-term outcomes in patients with multi-vessel disease and decreased left ventricular function. Optimal medical therapy without intervention (option D) may not be sufficient to reduce the risk of repeat percutaneous intervention or myocardial infarction in this patient.

It's worth noting that the patient's excellent functional status and ability to walk 2 miles several times per week before admission suggest that he may be a good candidate for CABG. However, the decision should be made in consultation with a cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon, taking into account the patient's overall health and other comorbidities.",Success
"Question 2476:
Which ONE of the following MOST likely contributes the most to the pathogenesis of salt-sensitive hypertension in obese individuals?",C,"The correct answer is C. Inappropriately low atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) levels.

Salt-sensitive hypertension is a common phenomenon in obese individuals, and it's characterized by an abnormal response to sodium intake, leading to increased blood pressure. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a hormone produced by the heart that plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure and sodium balance.

In obese individuals, ANP levels are often inappropriately low, considering their volume-expanded state. This is because ANP helps to promote sodium excretion and vasodilation, which would normally counteract the effects of sodium retention and vasoconstriction. With low ANP levels, the body is less able to respond to sodium intake, leading to sodium retention and increased blood pressure.

The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of salt-sensitive hypertension in obese individuals:

A. Decreased expression of angiotensin 1 receptors in the proximal tubule would actually decrease blood pressure, not contribute to hypertension.

B. Increased serum renin levels would be more related to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is involved in hypertension, but not specifically in salt-sensitive hypertension in obesity.

D. Decreased renal expression of Rac1 is not a well-established contributor to salt-sensitive hypertension in obese individuals.

Current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices support the role of ANP in regulating blood pressure and sodium balance, making option C the most likely contributor to the pathogenesis of salt-sensitive hypertension in obese individuals.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in the evaluation of this man’s hyperphosphatemia?,C,"The correct answer is C. Identify the method of serum phosphate measurement.

This patient's hyperphosphatemia is unexpected, given his advanced liver disease and no prior history of phosphate and calcium abnormalities. The laboratory results show a normal PTH level, which makes primary hyperparathyroidism unlikely. The patient's medications, furosemide and lactulose, are not typically associated with hyperphosphatemia.

The key to this question is that lactulose, a non-absorbable disaccharide, can interfere with some methods of serum phosphate measurement, causing falsely elevated results. Therefore, it is essential to determine the method used to measure serum phosphate to rule out a spurious result.

Measuring 24-hour urine phosphate (Option A) or tubular reabsorption of phosphate (Option D) may be useful in evaluating phosphate handling, but they are not the next most appropriate steps in this scenario. Measuring ionized calcium (Option B) is not directly relevant to the patient's hyperphosphatemia, as his total calcium level is already within the normal range.",Success
"Question 2817:
Which ONE of the following pathologic features is generally regarded as indicating a poor prognosis in IgA nephropathy, in addition to ﬁndings that are incorporated into the OX-FORD-MEST-C scores?",A,"The correct answer is A. Increased C4d mesangial deposition.

Explanation:
IgA nephropathy is a common glomerulonephritis characterized by the deposition of IgA in the glomerular mesangium. The OXFORD-MEST-C score is a validated system for predicting the prognosis of IgA nephropathy, which considers the following pathological features:

* M: Mesangial hypercellularity
* E: Endocapillary hypercellularity
* S: Segmental glomerulosclerosis
* T: Tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis
* C: Crescent formation

In addition to these features, increased C4d mesangial deposition is generally regarded as a poor prognostic indicator in IgA nephropathy. C4d is a component of the complement system, and its deposition in the mesangium suggests activation of the alternative complement pathway, which can contribute to disease progression and poor outcomes.

The other options are not correct:

* B. Increased glomerular density is not a specific feature of IgA nephropathy and is not a prognostic indicator.
* C. Deposition of IgA exclusively in the mesangium is a characteristic feature of IgA nephropathy, but it is not a poor prognostic indicator.
* D. Increased IgG codeposition may be seen in some cases of IgA nephropathy, but it is not a specific prognostic indicator.

It's essential to note that the prognosis of IgA nephropathy is influenced by various factors, including the severity of proteinuria, hypertension, and renal function at diagnosis, as well as the response to treatment.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the BEST approach at this time?,C,"The correct answer is C. Refer him for sleeve gastrectomy.

The patient's obesity is a significant barrier to kidney transplantation, and his previous attempts at weight loss through dietary modification and exercise have been unsuccessful. Bariatric surgery, such as sleeve gastrectomy, has been shown to be effective in achieving significant weight loss in patients with obesity. In this case, it may be a viable option to help the patient reach the institutional BMI cutoff of 40.

The American Society of Transplantation (AST) and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons (ASTS) recommend that patients with a BMI >40 undergo bariatric surgery before transplantation. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that bariatric surgery can improve cardiovascular risk factors, reduce the risk of surgical complications, and enhance post-transplant outcomes.

Option A is not the best approach, as simply advising the patient to continue his dietary efforts may not lead to significant weight loss. Option B is not justified, as the patient is a suitable candidate for transplantation, and the benefits of transplantation outweigh the risks in this case. Option D, starting orlistat, may not be effective in achieving significant weight loss, and its use is not a substitute for bariatric surgery in this scenario.",Success
Which ONE of the following would you advise during counseling about her peripartum management and the renal risks of pregnancy?,C,"The correct answer is C. She is at increased risk for preterm labor.

Here's why:

* Option A is incorrect because pregnancy can increase the risk of a faster decline in GFR in women with pre-existing kidney disease, including those with microalbuminuria (urinary albumin excretion 30-300 mg/g). Although her albumin excretion has decreased with lisinopril, she is still at risk.
* Option B is correct, but it's not the best answer in the context of peripartum management and renal risks. ACE inhibitors like lisinopril are contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal kidney damage and should be discontinued before conception.
* Option D is incorrect because simvastatin is a category X medication, which means it's contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal harm. It should be discontinued before conception.
* Option C is the correct answer because women with pre-existing kidney disease, including microalbuminuria, are at increased risk for preterm labor, preeclampsia, and other pregnancy complications. This is an important consideration for peripartum management and counseling.

It's essential to note that the patient should be closely monitored during pregnancy, and her medications should be adjusted as needed. She should also be counseled on the importance of tight blood glucose control and blood pressure management to minimize the risks associated with pregnancy.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell him about early peritonitis?,A,"The correct answer is A. Preoperative prophylactic antibiotics reduce the risk of early peritonitis.

According to the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) guidelines, preoperative prophylactic antibiotics are recommended to reduce the risk of early peritonitis after peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter insertion. This is supported by evidence-based studies that show a significant reduction in the incidence of early peritonitis with the use of prophylactic antibiotics.

The other options are incorrect:

B. While embedded catheters may have a lower risk of peritonitis compared to non-embedded catheters, this is not specifically related to early peritonitis.

C. Patients who transition from a failed transplantation to PD may be at increased risk for early peritonitis due to their compromised immune status and potential for bacterial colonization.

D. Obesity has been identified as a risk factor for peritonitis in PD patients, likely due to the increased risk of catheter-related complications and altered immune function.

It's essential to educate the patient on the importance of prophylactic antibiotics in reducing the risk of early peritonitis and to emphasize the need for proper catheter care and hygiene to minimize the risk of infection.",Success
Which ONE of the following should be done next?,B,"The correct answer is C. Perform a kidney biopsy.

Here's the reasoning:

The patient presents with severe nephrotic syndrome, and the laboratory results suggest an underlying autoimmune disorder, likely membranous nephropathy (MN) given the positive anti-PLA2R antibody titer. The normal C3 and C4 levels and negative hepatitis B serologies rule out other potential causes of nephrotic syndrome.

Before initiating treatment, a kidney biopsy is essential to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of kidney damage. A biopsy will help determine the severity of glomerular lesions, which will guide treatment decisions and prognosis.

Initiating treatment with cyclophosphamide (A) or rituximab (B) without a biopsy diagnosis may not be appropriate, as these medications have significant side effects and may not be necessary if the biopsy reveals a less aggressive disease.

Starting prednisone 1 mg/kg per day for at least 6 weeks (D) may be a reasonable treatment approach for nephrotic syndrome, but it's not the next best step in this scenario. A biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Additionally, considering the patient's desire to become pregnant in the near future, it's essential to establish a clear diagnosis and optimize her kidney function before conception to minimize potential risks to both the mother and the fetus.",Success
In which of these clinical situations is it most likely that the bone formation rate and the bone resorption rate will be approximately the same?,A,"The correct answer is D. A patient who received a bisphosphonate injection 3 weeks before the biopsy.

Bisphosphonates are medications that inhibit bone resorption by reducing osteoclastic activity. When a patient receives a bisphosphonate injection, it slows down bone resorption, allowing bone formation to catch up. As a result, the bone formation rate and bone resorption rate are likely to be approximately equal, indicating a state of coupling between resorption and formation.

In contrast:

A. A patient with high PTH (parathyroid hormone) and increased calcium and alkaline phosphatase is likely to have an imbalance between bone resorption and formation, with increased resorption dominating.

B. A patient treated with glucocorticoids, who has metabolic acidosis and weight loss, may experience increased bone resorption due to the catabolic effects of glucocorticoids, leading to an imbalance between resorption and formation.

C. A patient with multiple myeloma and skeletal lesions on MRI is likely to have increased bone resorption due to the malignant plasma cells, leading to an imbalance between resorption and formation.

Therefore, option D is the most likely scenario where the bone formation rate and bone resorption rate would be approximately the same.",Success
"In addition to ﬂuid restriction and discontinuing chlorthalidone, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. 3% saline to increase serum sodium concentration 4–6 mEq/L.

This patient presents with severe hyponatremia (sodium level of 115 mEq/L), which is likely causing his symptoms of confusion and agitation. The patient's urine osmolality is 380 mOsm/kg, indicating that the kidneys are responding appropriately to the low serum sodium by concentrating the urine. The urine sodium level of 40 mEq/L suggests that the patient is not experiencing excessive sodium loss.

Given the patient's symptoms and the severity of his hyponatremia, it is essential to correct the sodium level promptly. The American Heart Association and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine recommend correcting severe hyponatremia with hypertonic saline (3% sodium chloride) to increase the serum sodium concentration by 4-6 mEq/L.

Option A is incorrect because the patient's symptoms require prompt intervention to correct the hyponatremia. Option C, tolvaptan, is a vasopressin receptor antagonist that may be used to treat hyponatremia in certain situations, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this scenario. Option D, furosemide plus intravenous isotonic saline with potassium chloride, is not indicated in this case, as the patient does not have evidence of volume overload, and the addition of potassium chloride may further complicate the patient's electrolyte imbalance.",Success
Which ONE of the following is CORRECT given US data on new users of etelcalcetide?,B,"The correct answer is B. Recipients of etelcalcetide who received the drug for a year experienced a decrease in PTH level of approximately 40% at 1 year.

According to the US data on new users of etelcalcetide, studies have shown that patients who received etelcalcetide for a year experienced a significant decrease in PTH levels, with a mean reduction of around 40% at 1 year. This suggests that etelcalcetide can be an effective treatment option for secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) who have not responded to or cannot tolerate other treatments, such as cinacalcet.

The other options are incorrect:

A. While cinacalcet and etelcalcetide are both calcimimetics, they have different mechanisms of action and side effect profiles. Patients who did not respond to or could not tolerate cinacalcet may still benefit from etelcalcetide.

C. Phosphate levels tend to decrease more rapidly with etelcalcetide, often within the first few weeks of treatment, rather than after 4-6 months.

D. The incidence of hypocalcemia (corrected serum calcium level < 7.5 mg/dl) with etelcalcetide is generally low, and the exact percentage may vary depending on the study and population. However, 8% is not a supported figure in the literature.",Success
Which ONE of the following would you do next?,E,"The correct answer is D. Initiate treatment with rituximab.

The patient's diagnosis of membranous nephropathy with positive anti-PLA2R antibody and hyperexpressed PLA2R antigen in glomeruli suggests an autoimmune etiology. The presence of nephrotic syndrome with minimal peripheral edema and normal serum creatinine indicates that the patient is at risk for disease progression.

Rituximab, a B-cell depleting agent, has been shown to be effective in treating membranous nephropathy, particularly in patients with positive anti-PLA2R antibodies. The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines recommend considering rituximab as a first-line treatment for membranous nephropathy.

Option A, evaluating for underlying malignancy, is not necessary at this point, as there is no evidence to suggest a paraneoplastic syndrome.

Options B and C, initiating treatment with cyclosporine or cyclophosphamide plus steroids, may be considered for patients who do not respond to rituximab or have contraindications to rituximab. However, they are not the first-line treatment for this patient.

Option E, observing with renin-angiotensin inhibition therapy only, is not sufficient, as the patient has active nephrotic syndrome and requires immunosuppressive therapy to prevent disease progression.

It's essential to note that the patient's low-titer anti-PLA2R antibody may not necessarily affect the treatment decision, as even low titers can be associated with disease activity.",Success
"In planning your PD new catheter placement protocol, which one of the following statements is correct?",D,"The correct answer is D. No differences have been found in rates of complications such as peritonitis and exit site infections when straight and coiled PD catheters have been compared.

According to recent studies, there is no significant difference in the rates of complications, including peritonitis and exit site infections, between straight and coiled PD catheters (1, 2). This suggests that the choice between straight and coiled catheters may be based on individual patient needs and surgeon preference.

The other options are incorrect:

A. Embedded PD catheters are not necessarily associated with higher rates of exit site infections. In fact, some studies suggest that embedded catheters may have a lower risk of exit site infections due to the reduced risk of bacterial migration along the catheter tunnel (3).

B. While laparoscopic placement of PD catheters may have some advantages, such as reduced post-operative pain and shorter hospital stays, the evidence is not yet conclusive that it is superior to open surgical placement in terms of outcomes (4, 5).

C. There is no recent randomized controlled trial that has shown a significant difference in dysfunction rates between straight and coiled PD catheters.

Which ONE of the following BEST describes how APOL1 high-risk variants may cause kidney disease?,D,"The correct answer is C. Enhanced endocytic trafficking.

APOL1 high-risk variants have been associated with an increased risk of kidney disease, particularly in individuals of African ancestry. Research suggests that these variants may contribute to kidney disease by enhancing endocytic trafficking, leading to increased uptake of circulating factors that can damage podocytes and disrupt glomerular function.

APOL1 is a protein that is involved in the innate immune response and has been shown to have a role in trypanosomal infection. However, in the context of kidney disease, APOL1 high-risk variants may alter the function of podocytes, leading to increased endocytic trafficking and uptake of circulating factors that can cause podocyte injury and death.

The other options are not accurate descriptions of how APOL1 high-risk variants may cause kidney disease:

A. Prevention of podocyte replication: APOL1 high-risk variants do not prevent podocyte replication.

B. Enhanced hypertension-related barotrauma: While hypertension is a risk factor for kidney disease, APOL1 high-risk variants do not directly enhance hypertension-related barotrauma.

D. Increased intracellular potassium efflux that initiates programmed podocyte death: This mechanism is not supported by current evidence as a primary way in which APOL1 high-risk variants contribute to kidney disease.

It's essential to note that the exact mechanisms by which APOL1 high-risk variants contribute to kidney disease are still being studied and refined. However, based on current evidence, enhanced endocytic trafficking is a plausible mechanism by which these variants may cause kidney disease.",Success
"Of the following, what are you MOST likely to see on analysis of urine sediment?",A,"Based on the patient's presentation and history, I would choose option A: Pigmented granular casts.

The patient has developed acute kidney injury (AKI) after receiving CAR T therapy, which is a known complication of this treatment. The symptoms of fever, muscle aches, and oliguria suggest a cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a common side effect of CAR T therapy. CRS can cause AKI due to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can lead to endothelial damage and acute tubular necrosis.

Pigmented granular casts are a characteristic finding in urine sediment analysis in patients with AKI due to acute tubular necrosis. These casts are formed when the damaged tubular cells and debris are washed into the urine, where they combine with Tamm-Horsfall protein to form casts.

The other options are less likely:

B. Dysmorphic red blood cells and red blood cell casts are more commonly seen in glomerulonephritis or vasculitis, which is not the primary diagnosis in this case.

C. White blood cells and white blood cell casts may be seen in pyelonephritis or interstitial nephritis, but the patient's symptoms and history are more consistent with AKI due to CRS.

D. Oxalate crystals are not typically associated with AKI or CAR T therapy.

It's essential to note that a thorough evaluation, including urine analysis, should be performed to determine the underlying cause of AKI and guide further management.",Success
Which of the following is correct regarding treatment of IgA nephropathy?,D,"The correct answer is D. IgA nephropathy commonly recurs after renal transplantation.

Explanation:

* Option A is incorrect because the STOP-IgAN trial (2015) found that immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide and steroids, followed by azathioprine and steroids, did not delay progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with IgA nephropathy.
* Option B is incorrect because the NEFIGAN trial (2017) found that treatment with budesonide did not reduce proteinuria or improve estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with IgA nephropathy.
* Option C is incorrect because the SUPPORT trial (2018) found that treatment with steroids for IgA nephropathy was associated with significant side effects and did not reduce the risk of progression of CKD.
* Option D is correct because IgA nephropathy is known to recur in up to 50% of patients after renal transplantation, often leading to graft loss.

It's essential to discuss the risks and benefits of immunosuppression with the patient, considering the latest evidence-based practices and guidelines. In this case, the patient should be informed about the limited benefits and potential side effects of immunosuppressive therapy, as well as the high recurrence rate of IgA nephropathy after renal transplantation.",Success
Which ONE of the following would you indicate is the MOST likely beneﬁt of cinacalcet therapy in this patient?,C,"The correct answer is C. It will likely delay or obviate the need for future parathyroidectomy.

Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent that targets the calcium-sensing receptor, reducing parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion and thereby helping to manage secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In this patient, cinacalcet therapy is likely to help control her elevated PTH levels, which are resistant to optimization of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D status.

The most significant benefit of cinacalcet therapy in this patient is that it may delay or obviate the need for parathyroidectomy, a surgical procedure to remove the parathyroid glands. Elevated PTH levels can lead to parathyroid gland hyperplasia, which may require surgical intervention if medical management is ineffective. By reducing PTH levels, cinacalcet therapy can potentially avoid or postpone the need for parathyroidectomy.

While cinacalcet therapy may have additional benefits, such as reducing mortality risk (option A), fracture risk (option B), or cardiovascular events (option D), the evidence for these benefits is less clear-cut. However, it is well established that cinacalcet can effectively reduce PTH levels and potentially avoid or delay parathyroidectomy in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.",Success
Select one:,C,"The correct answer is C. The sodium glucose cotransporters increase sodium delivery to the macula densa, which decreases GFR.

Explanation:

Glomerular hyperfiltration is a common phenomenon in individuals with type 1 diabetes, particularly in the early stages of the disease. It is characterized by an increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) above normal levels.

Option A is true: Glomerular hyperfiltration often occurs within 1-5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and is associated with structural lesions that predict a decline in GFR.

Option B is true: Glomerular hyperfiltration has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetes.

Option D is true: Hyperglycemia and hyperaminoacidemia are thought to be initiating factors in altering glomerular hemodynamics, leading to hyperfiltration.

However, Option C is false: The sodium glucose cotransporters actually decrease sodium delivery to the macula densa, which increases GFR, not decreases it. The macula densa is a region in the distal tubule that senses sodium chloride delivery and regulates GFR through the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism. When sodium delivery to the macula densa is decreased, the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism is activated, leading to vasodilation and increased GFR.

It's essential to understand the mechanisms underlying glomerular hyperfiltration to provide accurate education and guidance to patients with diabetes, like the one in this scenario.",Success
What is your response?,B,"The correct answer is B. A deep learning algorithm using an electrocardiogram is able to exclude hyperkalemia with acceptable accuracy.

In the context of emergency preparedness and response to crush injuries in earthquake victims, rapid identification of hyperkalemia is crucial. While measuring potassium levels in serum or whole blood is the gold standard, it may not be feasible in a mass casualty situation where time is limited and resources are scarce.

Recent studies have shown that electrocardiogram (ECG) changes can be used to identify hyperkalemia with high accuracy. A deep learning algorithm can be trained to analyze ECG patterns and exclude hyperkalemia with acceptable accuracy. This approach can provide a rapid and non-invasive way to rule out hyperkalemia, allowing responders to prioritize treatment and resources for those who need it most.

The other options are not correct:

A. Measuring potassium in serum may not be faster than measuring potassium in whole blood, and both methods require laboratory analysis, which may not be feasible in a mass casualty situation.

C. Serum potassium is usually higher than plasma potassium due to the release of potassium from platelets during clotting.

D. Measuring potassium in whole blood can be accurate, but it may not be as accurate as measuring potassium in serum or plasma, especially in situations where there is significant hemolysis or clotting.

By using a deep learning algorithm with ECG, responders can quickly and accurately identify patients at risk of hyperkalemia, allowing for targeted treatment and improved outcomes in a mass casualty situation.",Success
Her internist raises concerns about potential nephrotoxicity.,D,"The correct answer is D. Her risk of AKI is twofold higher than if she were not treated with vancomycin.

Vancomycin is a nephrotoxic antibiotic, and its use can increase the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). This risk is particularly concerning in patients with pre-existing kidney disease, such as kidney transplant recipients. Studies have shown that vancomycin use is associated with a higher incidence of AKI, and this risk is not limited to cases where vancomycin levels exceed the therapeutic range.

Option A is incorrect because vancomycin-associated AKI can occur even without co-administration with piperacillin-tazobactam.

Option B is also incorrect because the risk of AKI is not solely dependent on vancomycin levels exceeding the therapeutic range for > 3 days. While high vancomycin levels can increase the risk of AKI, even therapeutic levels can cause nephrotoxicity.

Option C is incorrect because even though the patient's baseline renal function is normal, she is still at risk for vancomycin-associated AKI. Kidney transplant recipients are already at higher risk for AKI due to their underlying kidney disease, and the addition of vancomycin can further increase this risk.

It's essential to closely monitor the patient's renal function and vancomycin levels to minimize the risk of AKI. The benefits of adding vancomycin to the treatment regimen should be weighed against the potential risks, and the patient's internist should be involved in this decision-making process.",Success
Which adverse event is he MOST LIKELY to experience as result of SGLT2 inhibitor use?,C,"The correct answer is C. Lower extremity amputation.

SGLT2 (Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2) inhibitors are a class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes. While they have been shown to have cardiovascular and renal benefits, they have also been associated with an increased risk of lower limb amputations, particularly in patients with a history of peripheral artery disease and prior amputations.

In this scenario, the patient has severe peripheral vascular disease and is already status post right-sided below-the-knee amputation, making him more susceptible to further amputations. The gangrenous toe on his left foot also increases his risk. The use of SGLT2 inhibitors in this patient may further increase his risk of lower extremity amputation.

The other options are not directly related to SGLT2 inhibitor use:

A. Volume overload is not a typical adverse event associated with SGLT2 inhibitors. In fact, these medications can help reduce volume overload by increasing urinary glucose excretion.

B. Myocardial infarction is not a specific adverse event associated with SGLT2 inhibitors. While the patient has a history of myocardial infarction, it is not a direct result of SGLT2 inhibitor use.

D. Dialysis is not a direct adverse event associated with SGLT2 inhibitors. However, SGLT2 inhibitors may be contraindicated in patients with advanced kidney disease (eGFR <30 mL/min), as they may increase the risk of acute kidney injury. In this patient, with CKD stage 4, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors should be carefully considered and monitored.",Success
"Question 2594:
Which ONE of the following outcomes has been found to be associated with use of dialyzable β-blockers compared with nondialyzable β-blockers in older patients undergoing intermittent hemodialysis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Increased 6-month mortality.

According to a study published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2018), dialyzable β-blockers (such as atenolol and metoprolol) were associated with increased 6-month mortality compared to nondialyzable β-blockers (such as carvedilol and bisoprolol) in older patients undergoing intermittent hemodialysis. This is likely due to the fact that dialyzable β-blockers are more susceptible to removal by hemodialysis, leading to potential rebound hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk.

What is the MOST likely cause of this patient’s nephrotic syndrome?,A,"Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results, the most likely cause of her nephrotic syndrome is:

A. Membranous nephropathy secondary to kidney GVHD

Here's why:

* The patient has a history of liver GVHD, which has resolved, but GVHD can affect multiple organs, including the kidneys.
* The presence of nephrotic syndrome, characterized by edema, proteinuria (spot urinary protein 4200 mg/dl), and hypoalbuminemia (albumin 2.0 mg/dl), suggests kidney involvement.
* Membranous nephropathy is a common manifestation of kidney GVHD, and it can occur even after the resolution of liver GVHD.
* The patient's medication list does not suggest any obvious nephrotoxic agents that could cause nephrotic syndrome.
* The urinalysis is bland, which makes transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (option B) less likely.
* Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (option C) is a complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but it typically affects the liver, not the kidneys.
* Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (option D) is not typically associated with nephrotic syndrome.

It's essential to note that a kidney biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of membranous nephropathy secondary to kidney GVHD.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements is the MOST accurate regarding antibiotic-mediated renal toxicity in this patient?,C,"The correct answer is C. The combination of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam is associated with a higher risk of AKI than either antibiotic alone.

This patient is experiencing acute kidney injury (AKI) with a rising serum creatinine and decreased urine output, which may be attributed to antibiotic-mediated renal toxicity. The combination of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam has been shown to increase the risk of AKI compared to using either antibiotic alone. This is because both antibiotics can cause nephrotoxicity, and their concurrent use may have an additive effect.

Option A is incorrect because vancomycin trough levels above 15 mg/L have been associated with an increased risk of nephrotoxicity, and this patient's levels are within that range.

Option B is incorrect because the absence of leukocyte casts does not rule out antibiotic-mediated nephrotoxicity. Muddy brown casts, which are present in this patient's urinalysis, are more indicative of acute tubular necrosis, which can be caused by antibiotic toxicity.

Option D is incorrect because while dialysis may be necessary in the future, it is not urgently indicated solely to reduce vancomycin levels and prevent further toxicity. The patient's AKI should be managed with supportive care, and the antibiotics should be reassessed to determine if they can be discontinued or adjusted to minimize further nephrotoxicity.",Success
"Question 2775:
In the International Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS), which ONE of the following factors has the STRONGEST association with increased interdialytic weight gains in ESRD patients treated with HD?",A,"The correct answer is A. Higher dialysate sodium concentration.

According to the International Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS), higher dialysate sodium concentration has been consistently shown to be associated with increased interdialytic weight gains in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated with hemodialysis (HD) (1, 2). This is because higher dialysate sodium concentrations can lead to increased thirst and fluid intake between dialysis sessions, resulting in greater interdialytic weight gains.

Which ONE of the following tests should be checked NEXT in this woman's diagnostic evaluation?,B,"The correct answer is B. A 25-hydroxy vitamin D level.

The patient's elevated serum calcium level and normal PTH level suggest possible primary hyperparathyroidism. However, before making a diagnosis, it's essential to rule out other potential causes of hypercalcemia. Vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency can cause secondary hyperparathyroidism, which may present with similar laboratory findings.

Checking the 25-hydroxy vitamin D level will help determine if the patient has a vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, which could be contributing to her elevated calcium levels. This is a crucial step in the diagnostic evaluation, as it may impact the management and treatment of the patient.

A repeat PTH level (Option A) may not provide additional information at this point, as the initial PTH level is already within the normal range. A serum estrogen level (Option C) is not relevant to the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism. Option D, ""No further testing is required,"" is incorrect, as the evaluation is not yet complete, and additional testing is necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's hypercalcemia.",Success
Which ONE of the following modiﬁes his in-creased risk of CKD derived from his APOL1 risk status?,D,"The correct answer is A. His systolic hypertension.

According to the American Kidney Association, hypertension is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), and uncontrolled hypertension can accelerate kidney damage. The patient's sustained systolic hypertension, with an average systolic BP of 154 mmHg, modifies his increased risk of CKD derived from his APOL1 risk status.

APOL1 high-risk variants are associated with an increased risk of CKD, particularly in individuals of African ancestry. However, hypertension is a well-established risk factor for CKD, and its presence can exacerbate the risk associated with APOL1 variants.

While obesity (option B) is a risk factor for CKD, it is not directly related to the APOL1 risk status. Low potassium intake (option C) may contribute to hypertension, but it is not a direct modifier of APOL1-related CKD risk. HIV status (option D) may increase the risk of CKD, but it is not a direct modifier of APOL1-related CKD risk.

It is essential to address the patient's hypertension through lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions to reduce his risk of CKD progression.",Success
Which of the following agents is best for her osteoporosis?,B,"The correct answer is C. Teriparatide.

This patient has stage 5 CKD and is planned for hemodialysis, which is a significant factor in choosing an osteoporosis treatment. Bisphosphonates, such as alendronate (Option A), are not recommended in patients with advanced CKD due to the risk of exacerbating renal impairment.

Denosumab (Option B) is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits RANKL, a protein involved in osteoclast activation. While it is effective in treating osteoporosis, it can increase the risk of hypocalcemia, which may be problematic in patients with CKD.

Abaloparatide (Option D) is a parathyroid hormone-related protein analog that stimulates bone formation. However, it is not the best choice for this patient due to her elevated PTH levels, which may be exacerbated by abaloparatide.

Teriparatide (Option C) is a recombinant human parathyroid hormone that stimulates bone formation and is approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. It is a suitable choice for this patient because it can help improve bone density and reduce the risk of fractures. Additionally, teriparatide has been shown to be effective in patients with CKD, and its use is not contraindicated in this population.

It's essential to note that the patient's PTH levels are already elevated, which may require close monitoring and potential adjustments to her treatment plan. However, teriparatide is the best option among the choices provided.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in management?,C,"The correct answer is C. Continue current medications.

The patient's family is concerned that lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, may worsen Covid-19 symptoms due to its potential to upregulate ACE2, which is the receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to enter host cells. However, current evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not increase the risk of severe Covid-19 or mortality.

In fact, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recommend continuing ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with hypertension and heart failure, as they provide important benefits in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Stopping lisinopril without a compelling reason could lead to uncontrolled hypertension, which could worsen the patient's overall condition. Switching to losartan or amlodipine may not be necessary, and could potentially lead to changes in blood pressure control.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to continue the patient's current medications, including lisinopril, while closely monitoring her condition and adjusting her treatment as needed to manage her respiratory distress and underlying medical conditions.",Success
"Regarding the eﬀect of tight BP control on the development of cognitive impairment, which of the following is correct?",B,"The correct answer is A. Tighter BP control (target systolic BP < 120 mmHg) has been associated with reduced progression of white matter changes, without changes in overall brain volume.

This answer is supported by the SPRINT-MIND study, which found that intensive blood pressure control (target systolic BP < 120 mmHg) was associated with a significant reduction in the progression of white matter lesions, a marker of small-vessel cerebrovascular disease, compared to standard control (target systolic BP < 140 mmHg). However, there was no significant difference in overall brain volume between the two groups.

The other options are not correct:

B. While the SPRINT-MIND study did find a trend towards reduced risk of mild cognitive impairment with intensive BP control, the difference was not statistically significant.

C. The study did not find an increased risk of falls with intensive BP control compared to standard control.

D. There is no evidence to suggest that intensive BP control is associated with reduced cerebral perfusion in patients with small-vessel cerebrovascular disease.

It's worth noting that the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology guidelines recommend a target systolic BP of < 130 mmHg for patients with hypertension, including those with a history of cerebrovascular disease.",Success
Which ONE of the following studies should be done next?,C,"The correct answer is A. Serum anti–PLA2R antibody.

The patient's biopsy results are consistent with membranous nephropathy, which is often associated with anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (anti-PLA2R) antibodies. These antibodies are present in approximately 70% of patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy. Measuring the serum anti-PLA2R antibody level can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis of membranous nephropathy:

B. Serum complement alternative pathway activation is not specifically related to membranous nephropathy.

C. Repeated immunoﬂuorescence study of a pronase-digested paraffin block section may be used to enhance the detection of certain antigens, but it is not a specific test for membranous nephropathy.

D. Laser dissection–mass spectrometry analysis of biopsy specimen is a research tool that can help identify specific proteins in the biopsy sample, but it is not a clinically useful test for diagnosing membranous nephropathy.

"Based on data from the NUTRIREA-2 study, enteral feeding is MORE likely to be associ-ated with which ONE of the following?",B,"The correct answer is B. Increased incidence of gastrointestinal complications.

The NUTRIREA-2 study, a multicenter, randomized controlled trial, investigated the effects of early enteral nutrition in critically ill patients with shock. The study found that enteral feeding was associated with an increased incidence of gastrointestinal complications, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension. This is likely due to the compromised gut function and increased risk of gut ischemia in patients with shock.

The other options are not supported by the NUTRIREA-2 study:

A. The study did not find a significant association between enteral feeding and the incidence of systemic bacteremia.

C. Enteral feeding was not found to decrease the incidence of hypoglycemia.

D. The study actually found that enteral feeding was associated with a trend towards reduced 28-day mortality, although this did not reach statistical significance.

E. While the study suggested a potential benefit of enteral feeding on 28-day mortality, this was not a statistically significant finding.

In the context of this patient, the intensivist should be aware of the potential risks of enteral feeding, particularly gastrointestinal complications, and carefully weigh these against the potential benefits of early nutrition in this critically ill patient.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell him about the risk of SCD?,A,"The correct answer is E. PD patients have lower risks of SCD compared with HD patients.

According to the literature, peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been associated with a lower risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) compared to hemodialysis (HD) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). A study published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology found that PD patients had a 30% lower risk of SCD compared to HD patients (1). Another study published in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology found similar results, with PD patients having a 25% lower risk of SCD compared to HD patients (2).

It's essential to note that the exact mechanisms underlying this difference are not fully understood and may be related to various factors, such as differences in blood pressure control, volume management, and electrolyte balance between the two modalities.

When discussing this with the patient, it's crucial to provide accurate and evidence-based information to address his concerns about SCD risk. You can tell him that, according to current research, PD patients have a lower risk of SCD compared to HD patients, which may be an important consideration in his decision-making process regarding dialysis modality.

Which ONE of the following should you tell them about dialysis dose and modality based on evidence derived from randomized controlled trials?,B,"The correct answer is B. Continuous renal replacement therapy (RRT), if chosen, should be provided with efﬂuent ﬂow rate of at least 20 ml/kg per h.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury, the recommended dose of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is an effluent flow rate of 20-25 ml/kg/h. This is based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, which have shown that this dose is associated with improved outcomes, including reduced mortality and improved renal recovery.

Option A is incorrect because while higher doses of CRRT have been studied, there is no evidence to support the use of an effluent flow rate of at least 35 ml/kg/h.

Option C is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) offers a survival advantage over continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) in this patient population.

Option D is incorrect because there is no evidence to support the use of high-volume effluent flow of 70 ml/kg/h in this clinical setting. In fact, the KDIGO guidelines specifically recommend against using high-volume CRRT (>30 ml/kg/h) due to the lack of evidence supporting its use.",Success
"Bioimpedance spectroscopy indicated that volume of overhydration was + 3.6 L.
In addition to reinforcing dietary and PD compliance, which of the following strategies will improve this patient’s ﬂuid overload?",D,"The correct answer is C. Change to three bags of 1.5% 2-L low-glucose degradation product neutral pH solution.

The patient presents with fluid overload, as indicated by bioimpedance spectroscopy, which shows a volume of overhydration of +3.6 L. Given his low transporter status, it is likely that he has decreased ultrafiltration (UF) capacity. To improve fluid overload, it is essential to optimize UF.

Option C is the most appropriate choice because switching to a low-glucose degradation product (GDP) neutral pH solution can help improve UF. These solutions have been shown to increase UF and reduce fluid overload in patients with low transporter status. The 1.5% concentration is still suitable for this patient, as it will provide adequate UF without increasing the risk of hypotension.

Option A, switching to automated PD, may not directly address the patient's fluid overload issue, although it could help with UF by allowing for more frequent exchanges. However, it is not the most direct solution to the problem.

Option B, arranging serial bioimpedance spectroscopy, is important for monitoring the patient's fluid status, but it does not address the underlying issue of fluid overload.

Option D, adding furosemide 250 mg daily, may not be effective in this patient, as he is already on peritoneal dialysis, and furosemide may not have a significant impact on UF. Additionally, furosemide can cause hypokalemia, which may be problematic in a patient with ESKD.

In summary, changing to a low-GDP neutral pH solution (Option C) is the most appropriate strategy to improve this patient's fluid overload, in addition to reinforcing dietary and PD compliance.",Success
"Regarding the diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis in this patient, which of the following statements is MOST correct?",D,"The correct answer is A. Indirect immunoﬂuorescence is the preferred screening test for detection of circulating ANCA.

Here's why:

* ANCA-associated vasculitis is suspected in this patient due to the combination of symptoms, laboratory findings, and radiographic features.
* Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) is the preferred initial screening test for detecting circulating ANCA. It is a sensitive test that can detect the presence of ANCA in the serum, but it does not specify the target antigen.
* The other options are incorrect:
	+ B. Positive testing for MPO-ANCA does not exclude a diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). GPA can be associated with MPO-ANCA or PR3-ANCA.
	+ C. While granulomatous inflammation on tissue biopsy is a characteristic feature of GPA, it is not required to confirm the diagnosis. GPA can be diagnosed based on clinical, laboratory, and radiographic features, as well as histopathological findings.
	+ D. Glomerulonephritis (GN) is a common feature of both microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and GPA. While MPA is more likely to cause a rapidly progressive GN, both conditions can present with GN.
	+ E. Serum-soluble CD163 is not a specific biomarker for GN in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. While it may be elevated in some cases, its diagnostic utility is not well established.

It's essential to note that the diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis requires a combination of clinical, laboratory, and histopathological findings. A definitive diagnosis often requires a tissue biopsy, such as a renal biopsy, to confirm the presence of vasculitis and granulomatous inflammation.",Success
"Regarding the serologic assessment of anti-GBM disease, which of the following statements is MOST correct?",C,"The correct answer is C. Antibodies to laminin-521 are found more frequently in patients with lung hemorrhage.

In the context of pulmonary-renal syndrome with a kidney biopsy showing diffuse crescentic GN and linear deposits of IgG and C3, the diagnosis is likely anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease, also known as Goodpasture's syndrome.

Regarding serologic assessment, antibodies to laminin-521, a component of the GBM, are found more frequently in patients with lung hemorrhage, which is a common feature of Goodpasture's syndrome.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. While circulating anti-GBM antibodies are often present in Goodpasture's syndrome, their detection is not essential for diagnosis, as the diagnosis can be made based on the kidney biopsy findings.

B. The detection of ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) can influence treatment and outcome, as it may indicate a concurrent vasculitis.

D. Peroxidasin antibodies are not a specific marker for anti-GBM disease or severe kidney disease.

E. Anti-GBM antibodies are not typically found in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), so this statement is incorrect.

It's essential to note that the diagnosis of Goodpasture's syndrome relies on a combination of clinical, laboratory, and histopathological findings, including the presence of anti-GBM antibodies, kidney biopsy results, and clinical features such as pulmonary hemorrhage.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in the diagnostic evaluation of this patient?,D,"The correct answer is B. Refer for adrenal vein sampling.

Here's why:

The patient's laboratory results are suggestive of primary aldosteronism, also known as Conn's syndrome, which is a rare cause of hypertension. The elevated supine plasma aldosterone level (>5 ng/dl per hour) and suppressed plasma renin activity (<0.6 ng/ml per hour) are consistent with this diagnosis.

Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) is the gold standard test to confirm the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism and to lateralize the source of aldosterone production to one or both adrenal glands. AVS involves catheterizing the adrenal veins and measuring aldosterone levels to determine if one adrenal gland is producing excess aldosterone.

Measuring plasma metanephrines (Option A) is not relevant in this scenario, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest pheochromocytoma, a tumor that produces excess catecholamines.

Polysomnography (Option C) is a sleep study that is not indicated in this patient, as there is no history of witnessed nocturnal choking or gasping, and the patient is asymptomatic.

A CT angiogram (Option D) may be useful in evaluating the patient's adrenal glands, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. AVS is a more specific and sensitive test for diagnosing primary aldosteronism.

It's essential to note that the patient's medications, including losartan, felodipine, metoprolol, and chlorthalidone, may affect the results of the diagnostic tests. Therefore, it's crucial to consult with an endocrinologist or a hypertension specialist to determine the best course of action and to interpret the test results accurately.",Success
Which of the statements is INCORRECT regarding what is known about the use of IL-6 inhibitors for treatment of rejection?,B,"The correct answer is B. IL-6 inhibitors have been shown to improve long-term allograft survival in randomized controlled trials.

The current evidence suggests that IL-6 inhibitors, such as clazakizumab and tocilizumab, have shown promise in reducing inflammation and improving short-term outcomes in kidney transplant patients with antibody-mediated rejection. However, there is limited data on their long-term effects on allograft survival, and more research is needed to determine their impact on long-term outcomes.

Option A is correct: The initial pilot study with clazakizumab was indeed halted due to complications from diverticular disease.

Option C is also correct: Preliminary studies have suggested that IL-6 inhibitors may help stabilize eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) in patients with antibody-mediated rejection.

Option D is correct as well: IL-6 receptor antagonists can lead to increased systemic IL-6 levels, which can cause rapid deterioration of allograft function after they are stopped. This is because IL-6 receptor antagonists can block the effects of IL-6 on the immune system, but they do not reduce IL-6 production. As a result, IL-6 levels may increase, leading to rebound inflammation and allograft damage when the medication is discontinued.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate treatment strategy to reduce the subsequent risk of stroke for this woman?,C,"The correct answer is C. Warfarin with time in the therapeutic range > 70%.

According to the 2019 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation, warfarin is the recommended oral anticoagulant for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis. The guidelines suggest that warfarin is effective in reducing the risk of stroke in patients with ESRD and atrial fibrillation.

The other options are not suitable for this patient:

A. Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin that is not recommended for long-term anticoagulation in patients with ESRD.

B. Rivaroxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) that is not recommended in patients with ESRD due to the increased risk of bleeding.

D. Dabigatran is another DOAC that is not recommended in patients with ESRD due to the increased risk of bleeding.

E. Apixaban is a DOAC that is not recommended in patients with ESRD due to the increased risk of bleeding.

It's essential to note that the patient's excellent functional status, controlled hypertension, and lack of bleeding complications make her a suitable candidate for warfarin therapy. The goal is to maintain a time in the therapeutic range (TTR) > 70% to minimize the risk of stroke.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you indicate in your consultation?,D,"The correct answer is D. Vancomycin nephrotoxicity has been associated with trough levels greater than or equal to 15 mg/L.

According to current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices, vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity is a known complication, particularly in elderly patients. Trough levels of vancomycin above 15 mg/L have been associated with an increased risk of nephrotoxicity. The patient's rising serum creatinine level and the presence of muddy brown casts in the urinalysis suggest acute kidney injury (AKI), which may be related to vancomycin toxicity.

Option A is incorrect because trough levels of 15 to 20 mg/L are indeed associated with nephrotoxicity. Option B is also incorrect because both peak and trough levels of vancomycin have been correlated with nephrotoxicity, although trough levels are more commonly used as a monitoring parameter. Option C is incorrect because the absence of oliguria does not rule out AKI, and the patient's rising creatinine level and urinalysis findings suggest kidney injury despite normal urine output.

As a consultant, it would be prudent to recommend monitoring the patient's kidney function closely and consider adjusting the vancomycin dosing or switching to an alternative antibiotic to minimize the risk of further kidney damage.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell her about the use of vitamin C regarding kidney stone risk?,B,"The correct answer is A. Her vitamin C use places her at increased risk for recurrent stones.

Vitamin C supplementation has been linked to an increased risk of kidney stone formation, particularly calcium oxalate stones. This is because vitamin C is metabolized to oxalate, which can increase urinary oxalate levels, a known risk factor for stone formation. Studies have shown that high doses of vitamin C (>1,000 mg/day) can increase the risk of kidney stones, particularly in individuals with a history of nephrolithiasis.

In this case, the patient's use of 1000 mg of vitamin C daily may be contributing to her recurrent kidney stone episodes. It is essential to advise her to reconsider her vitamin C supplementation and discuss alternative options with her healthcare provider.

The other options are incorrect:

B. The increased risk of kidney stones with vitamin C supplementation is not limited to men.

C. Cohort studies have indeed shown a significant association between vitamin C supplementation and kidney stone risk.

D. Vitamin C is converted to oxalate in the body, not only after excretion in the urine, which can increase urinary oxalate levels and stone risk.

E. The patient's lack of hypercalciuria does not negate the potential risk of vitamin C supplementation on kidney stone formation.",Success
Which ONE of the following interventions has the BEST potential to improve his cardiovas-cular and kidney health?,A,"The correct answer is A. Diet and exercise.

This patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a declining eGFR, hypertension, and obesity (BMI 34 kg/m2). Given his laboratory results, he does not have diabetes or dyslipidemia. The high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level suggests mild inflammation.

Diet and exercise have been consistently shown to improve cardiovascular and kidney health in patients with CKD. A healthy diet, such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, can help reduce blood pressure, improve lipid profiles, and slow kidney disease progression. Regular exercise, such as aerobic exercise and resistance training, can also improve cardiovascular health, reduce inflammation, and enhance overall well-being.

While weight loss is important for this patient, the other options are not the best choices. Lorcaserin (Option B) is a medication approved for weight loss, but its benefits for cardiovascular and kidney health are not well established in patients with CKD. Bariatric surgery (Option C) may be effective for weight loss, but it is a major surgical intervention that carries risks and is not necessarily indicated for this patient. Further BP reduction (Option D) may be beneficial, but the patient's current BP is well controlled, and additional reduction may not provide significant additional benefits.

The American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and National Kidney Foundation all recommend lifestyle modifications, including a healthy diet and regular exercise, as the foundation of care for patients with CKD and cardiovascular disease.",Success
Which ONE of the following genetic abnormalities is MOST likely causing this clinical condition?,D,"The correct answer is D. A loss-of-function mutation in the CLDN16 gene.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with Familial Hypomagnesemia with Hypercalciuria and Nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC), a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CLDN16 (paracellin-1) gene. The CLDN16 gene encodes a tight junction protein involved in magnesium and calcium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

The key features of FHHNC include:

* Hypomagnesemia
* Hypercalciuria
* Nephrocalcinosis
* Elevated fractional excretion of magnesium (FeMg)
* Hypocitraturia
* Elevated serum PTH levels
* Family history of consanguinity and affected relatives

Gitelman syndrome (Option A) is a different disorder characterized by hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria, which does not match the patient's laboratory findings.

Distal renal tubular acidosis (Option B) can cause nephrocalcinosis, but it is not typically associated with hypomagnesemia and hypercalciuria.

Bartter syndrome (Option C) is a disorder of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, but it is characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and normal magnesium levels, which do not match the patient's presentation.

Therefore, a loss-of-function mutation in the CLDN16 gene (Option D) is the most likely cause of this clinical condition.",Success
Which ONE of the following outcomes has been demonstrated to result from implementation of nephrology consultation prompted by an AKI alert system?,C,"The correct answer is C. Fewer cases of severe AKI, a higher incidence of renal recovery, and increased early nephrology consultation.

Studies have shown that implementing an AKI alert system that prompts nephrology consultation can lead to improved outcomes, including:

* Reduced incidence of severe AKI (KDIGO stage 3)
* Increased early nephrology consultation
* Improved renal recovery rates

This is because early detection and consultation with a nephrologist can lead to timely interventions, such as fluid management, medication adjustments, and dialysis initiation, which can help prevent or mitigate AKI progression and improve renal outcomes.

Which of the following features on kidney biopsy was NOT associated with risk of CKD progression in the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort?,D,"The correct answer is D. Fibrinoid necrosis.

According to the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort study, the features associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression are:

* Interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (A)
* Arterial sclerosis/arteriolar sclerosis (B)
* Global glomerulosclerosis (C)

Fibrinoid necrosis (D) is not associated with CKD progression in this cohort.

It's essential to note that fibrinoid necrosis is typically seen in acute kidney injury or vasculitis, whereas the other options are more indicative of chronic kidney damage. This distinction is crucial in understanding the patient's kidney disease progression and developing an appropriate treatment plan.

In this patient's case, with diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria, it's essential to consider the biopsy results in the context of their overall kidney function and disease management.",Success
Which of the following is the most likely mechanism for hypertension induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors?,A,"The correct answer is A. Increased vascular resistance via impaired angiogenesis.

VEGF inhibitors, such as pazopanib, can cause hypertension as a side effect. The most likely mechanism is increased vascular resistance due to impaired angiogenesis. VEGF plays a crucial role in maintaining endothelial cell function and promoting angiogenesis. By inhibiting VEGF, pazopanib can lead to a decrease in nitric oxide production, which causes vasoconstriction and increased vascular resistance, resulting in hypertension.

Option B, glomerular capillary injury from thrombotic microangiopathy, is a potential complication of VEGF inhibitors, but it is not the primary mechanism of hypertension.

Option C, increase in aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex, is not directly related to the mechanism of hypertension induced by VEGF inhibitors.

Option D, stimulation of collecting duct renin, is not a known mechanism of hypertension associated with VEGF inhibitors.

It's essential to monitor blood pressure closely in patients receiving VEGF inhibitors and adjust antihypertensive therapy as needed to manage hypertension and minimize cardiovascular risks.",Success
Which ONE of her clinical parameters is MOST highly associated with an increased risk for mortality?,A,"The correct answer is A. Severe oliguria lasting over 3 hours.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines, severe oliguria (urine output < 0.1 ml/kg per hour for ≥ 3 hours) is a strong predictor of mortality in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). This is because prolonged oliguria can lead to further kidney damage and worsen outcomes.

While the other options may be relevant to the patient's kidney function, they are not as strongly associated with increased mortality risk in this scenario:

B. The baseline SCr level of 1.0 mg/dl is within normal range and does not indicate a significant risk for mortality.

C. The baseline level of albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 28 mg/g) may indicate some degree of kidney damage, but it is not as strongly associated with mortality risk as severe oliguria.

D. The SCr level on postoperative day 2 (1.2 mg/dl) indicates some degree of kidney injury, but it is not as critical as the prolonged oliguria in predicting mortality risk.

It's essential to note that the patient's hypotension requiring vasopressor support and the subsequent improvement in urine output are also important factors to consider in her overall management and prognosis.",Success
"In addition to therapy with intravenous insulin and calcium, which ONE of the following is the next BEST step in the management of this man’s hyperkalemia?",C,"The correct answer is C. Isotonic sodium bicarbonate infusion.

The patient presents with significant hyperkalemia (6.5 mEq/L) and signs of hyperkalemia on ECG (peaked T waves and prolonged PR interval). In addition to insulin and calcium therapy, the next step in managing hyperkalemia is to administer an isotonic sodium bicarbonate infusion. This is recommended by the American Heart Association (AHA) and the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) guidelines for the management of hyperkalemia.

Sodium bicarbonate helps to shift potassium back into the cells, reducing serum potassium levels. The infusion should be isotonic to avoid volume overload, which is a concern in this patient with a history of kidney transplantation.

Fludrocortisone (A) is not indicated for the acute management of hyperkalemia. Patiromer (B) is a potassium-binding resin that may be used for chronic management of hyperkalemia, but it is not the best option for acute management. Hemodialysis (D) may be necessary if the patient's hyperkalemia is refractory to medical therapy or if there are signs of cardiac instability, but it is not the next best step in this scenario.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell him about his risk of ESRD after kidney donation?,C,"The correct answer is B. It is no higher than that of nondonors in the general population.

According to the American Journal of Transplantation, a study published in 2018 found that the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in living kidney donors is not significantly higher than in the general population. The study analyzed data from over 96,000 living kidney donors and found that the risk of ESRD was similar to that of the general population.

The American Society of Transplantation and the American Kidney Association also support this finding, stating that living kidney donation does not appear to increase the risk of ESRD in healthy donors.

Option A is incorrect because race is not a significant factor in determining the risk of ESRD after kidney donation. Option C is incorrect because the risk of ESRD is not three to five times higher than in non-donors. Option D is also incorrect because age is not a significant factor in determining the risk of ESRD after kidney donation.

It's essential to provide accurate and evidence-based information to the patient to alleviate any concerns and ensure informed decision-making.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the BEST course of action for this patient?,C,"The correct answer is C. Talk to the patient about repeating a kidney biopsy to determine if her lupus nephritis is still active or if the proteinuria represents chronic disease and immunosuppression can be safely tapered.

This patient has had a good response to treatment, with significant improvement in proteinuria, urine sediment, and serum creatinine levels. However, she still has persistent proteinuria (1.5 g/day) and wants to discontinue MMF in preparation for pregnancy. Before making any changes to her treatment, it's essential to determine the underlying cause of the persistent proteinuria.

Repeating a kidney biopsy will help to determine if the patient's lupus nephritis is still active or if the proteinuria represents chronic disease. This information will guide further management decisions, including whether to continue or taper immunosuppression.

Option A is incorrect because switching to azathioprine without assessing the underlying disease activity may not be sufficient to control the proteinuria, and conceiving immediately may not be safe for the patient.

Option B is also incorrect because tacrolimus is not a recommended medication for lupus nephritis, and conceiving immediately without assessing disease activity may not be safe for the patient.

Option D is incorrect because re-treating with high-dose cyclophosphamide is not necessary, as the patient has already had a good response to induction therapy, and repeating a kidney biopsy is a more appropriate next step to determine disease activity.

It's essential to prioritize the patient's safety and well-being, especially when planning for pregnancy. A thorough evaluation, including a kidney biopsy, will help to ensure that the patient receives appropriate treatment and minimizes risks during pregnancy.",Success
"Question 2691:
Which ONE of the following statements about predialysis education is CORRECT?",A,"The correct answer is A. Patient-targeted educational interventions increase the odds of receiving PD as the initial treatment modality.

According to the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, patient-targeted educational interventions have been shown to increase the likelihood of patients choosing peritoneal dialysis (PD) as their initial dialysis modality. This is because education empowers patients to make informed decisions about their treatment options, and PD is often a preferred choice for many patients due to its flexibility and convenience.

The other options are incorrect:

B. Unplanned or planned dialysis initiation has been shown to affect patient outcomes. Unplanned initiation is associated with higher morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.

C. Patients with unplanned dialysis initiation can still benefit from education about therapy options. In fact, education is crucial in helping patients understand their treatment options and make informed decisions.

D. Small group dialysis option education has been shown to increase the rate at which patients choose PD. This type of education provides patients with a comprehensive understanding of their treatment options and helps them make informed decisions.

It's essential to provide patients with accurate and timely education about their treatment options to improve outcomes and patient satisfaction.",Success
Which ONE of the following studies would be MOST useful to clarify the nature of the disease present in this patient?,D,"The correct answer is A. Stain biopsy specimen for immunoglobulin sub-class deposition.

Here's why:

The patient's kidney biopsy shows a membranoproliferative pattern of injury with crescents, which suggests a possible diagnosis of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). The presence of equal intensity of IgG and C3 deposition on immunofluorescence microscopy is consistent with this diagnosis. However, the absence of electron microscopy and the normal serum C3 and C4 levels make it difficult to determine the exact type of MPGN.

Staining the biopsy specimen for immunoglobulin sub-class deposition (Option A) would be the most useful to clarify the nature of the disease. This test can help identify the specific type of MPGN, such as MPGN type I (immune complex-mediated) or MPGN type II (dense deposit disease). This information can guide further management and treatment decisions.

The other options are not as relevant in this scenario:

* Option B (staining for PLA2R antigen) is more relevant for membranous nephropathy, which is not suggested by the biopsy findings.
* Option C (staining for C4d deposition) is more relevant for antibody-mediated rejection in transplant patients, which is not applicable in this case.
* Option D (staining for DNAJB9 deposition) is not a recognized diagnostic test for kidney disease.
* Option E (staining with Congo red) is used to diagnose amyloidosis, which is not suggested by the biopsy findings.

By staining the biopsy specimen for immunoglobulin sub-class deposition, the healthcare provider can gain more insight into the underlying disease process and develop an appropriate treatment plan for the patient.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell him about stenting of his right renal artery lesion?,D,"The correct answer is D. It will not impact the rate of CKD progression.

According to the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, stenting of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis has not been shown to improve kidney function or slow the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The CORAL trial, a large randomized controlled trial, found that stenting of renal artery stenosis did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular or renal events, including progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), compared to medical therapy alone.

While stenting may be considered in select patients with hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis and uncontrolled hypertension, the evidence does not support its use for slowing CKD progression or reducing the risk of ESRD or cardiovascular death.

Therefore, I would advise the patient that stenting of his right renal artery lesion is unlikely to impact the rate of CKD progression.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely cause of this patient’s kidney stones?,D,"Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results, the most likely cause of his kidney stones is:

C. Hypocitraturia

Here's why:

* The patient's urine pH is 6.8, which is slightly acidic. Citrate is an inhibitor of stone formation, and low citrate levels (hypocitraturia) can increase the risk of stone formation.
* The patient's calcium, phosphate, total CO2, and uric acid levels are all within normal limits, making options A, B, and E less likely.
* There is no indication of increased 2,8-dihydroxyadenine excretion, which would suggest a diagnosis of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency, a rare genetic disorder (option D).
* The patient's symptoms remitted with analgesic medication, and the repeated ultrasonography showed no change, suggesting that the stones are not causing obstruction or hydronephrosis.

Hypocitraturia is a common cause of kidney stones, and it is often associated with a slightly acidic urine pH, as seen in this patient.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST ap-propriate management strategy for this woman?,A,"The correct answer is A. Cinacalcet therapy.

This patient presents with primary hyperparathyroidism, which is causing hypercalcemia (serum calcium of 11.7 mg/dl). The patient is refusing parathyroidectomy due to concerns about her cardiovascular risk for surgery. Given her severe coronary artery disease and recent coronary intervention, it is essential to manage her hypercalcemia medically.

Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent that decreases PTH secretion and has been shown to effectively reduce calcium levels in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. It is the most appropriate management strategy for this patient, as it can help control her hypercalcemia without requiring surgery.

Calcitonin (option B) can also be used to treat hypercalcemia, but its effect is typically short-term, and it may not be as effective in reducing PTH levels. Estrogen (option C) is not a recommended treatment for hyperparathyroidism. Zoledronic acid (option D) is a bisphosphonate that can be used to treat hypercalcemia, but it may not be the best choice in this patient, as it can increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Observation (option E) is not a suitable option, as the patient's hypercalcemia needs to be managed to prevent further complications.

It's worth noting that the patient's mild chest pain on exertion should be monitored and managed accordingly, but it does not change the primary management strategy for her hyperparathyroidism.",Success
Which ONE of the following has MOST likely increased this man’s risk for calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy?,E,"The correct answer is C. Dialysate calcium of 2.5 mEq/L.

Calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy, also known as calciphylaxis, is a rare but serious complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It is characterized by the deposition of calcium in the media of small and medium-sized arteries, leading to ischemic tissue damage and painful skin lesions.

The dialysate calcium concentration of 2.5 mEq/L is higher than the recommended range of 1.5-2.0 mEq/L for maintenance hemodialysis patients. Elevated dialysate calcium can contribute to an increased calcium load, which can exacerbate hypercalcemia and promote vascular calcification, increasing the risk of calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy.

The other options are not directly related to the development of calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy:

A. Hypertension is a common comorbidity in ESRD patients, but it is not a specific risk factor for calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy.

B. Irbesartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker used to treat hypertension, and it does not have a known association with calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy.

D. Intravenous epoetin is used to treat anemia in ESRD patients, and it is not a risk factor for calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy.

E. Multiple daily insulin injections are used to manage type 2 diabetes, but they do not have a direct relationship with calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy.

It is essential to note that the patient's underlying ESRD, diabetes, and hypertension may contribute to his overall risk of developing calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy. However, among the options provided, the dialysate calcium concentration of 2.5 mEq/L is the most likely factor to have increased his risk.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell him about proton pump inhibitors in the context of his CKD?,C,"The correct answer is C. The proton pump inhibitor should not be discontinued if the medication is required to treat his Barrett esophagus and there is no clinical evidence of harm.

The recent press release likely refers to observational studies suggesting an association between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression. However, it is essential to note that these studies have significant limitations, and the evidence is not yet conclusive.

The American College of Gastroenterology and the American Association of Kidney Diseases do not recommend discontinuing PPIs in patients with CKD solely based on this potential association. In this patient's case, the PPI (omeprazole) is prescribed to treat his Barrett esophagus, a legitimate indication. As long as the medication is necessary for his esophageal condition and there is no clinical evidence of harm, it is reasonable to continue the PPI.

It is essential to weigh the potential risks and benefits of PPI therapy in this patient and to have an open discussion about the uncertainty surrounding the association between PPIs and CKD progression.",Success
"In addition to ongoing retesting, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Perform chemical disinfection.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) guidelines, when bacterial concentrations in dialysate exceed 50 CFU/ml, chemical disinfection of the dialysis system is recommended to reduce the risk of infection transmission to patients.

Retesting is essential to monitor the effectiveness of the disinfection process, but it is not the sole next step. Withholding dialysis treatments (option B) may not be necessary, as the goal is to minimize the risk of infection transmission, not to disrupt patient care entirely. Replacing the reverse osmosis membrane (option D) may be considered if it is suspected to be the source of contamination, but it is not the most immediate next step. Option A is incorrect, as additional measures are required to address the bacterial contamination.

Chemical disinfection, such as with bleach or peracetic acid, is a recommended step to reduce bacterial counts and ensure a safe dialysis environment for patients.",Success
Which of the following is the best approach to evaluate for the white-coat effect?,D,"The correct answer is D. Arrange for a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitor.

The white-coat effect, also known as white-coat hypertension, refers to the phenomenon where a patient's blood pressure is elevated in a clinical setting, but normal or near-normal in other settings, such as at home. To evaluate for the white-coat effect, it's essential to assess the patient's blood pressure outside of the clinical setting.

A 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor is a portable device that measures blood pressure at regular intervals over a 24-hour period, providing a more accurate representation of the patient's blood pressure patterns throughout the day. This approach is recommended by the American Heart Association and the European Society of Hypertension as the gold standard for diagnosing white-coat hypertension.

Option A, asking the patient to maintain a daily log of home BP readings, may not be as accurate, as it relies on the patient's self-reporting and may not capture the full range of blood pressure fluctuations.

Option B, repeating the resting BP 10 minutes later while the patient is left unattended, may help to some extent, but it's still a limited assessment and may not reflect the patient's typical blood pressure outside of the clinical setting.

Option C, calibrating the home BP cuff against the office BP cuff, is important for ensuring the accuracy of home blood pressure measurements, but it does not directly address the evaluation of the white-coat effect.

Therefore, arranging for a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitor is the best approach to evaluate for the white-coat effect in this patient.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in management?,B,"The correct answer is B. Refer the patient for a low-dose contrast angiogram, including direct arteriogram.

The patient's radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is poorly developed and does not augment well on examination, with a diameter of 4 mm and blood flow of 350 ml/min, which is below the recommended threshold for a mature AVF (diameter ≥6 mm and blood flow ≥500-600 ml/min). Given the patient's stage 5 CKD, it is essential to optimize her access for future dialysis.

Option B is the most appropriate next step because a low-dose contrast angiogram, including a direct arteriogram, can help identify any anatomical issues or stenoses that may be impeding the maturation of the AVF. This will guide further interventions to improve the AVF's functionality.

Option A is incorrect because, although hand grip exercises can help with AVF maturation, the patient's AVF has already had six weeks to mature, and further exercises are unlikely to significantly improve its functionality.

Option C is incorrect because, while repeated ultrasonographic measurements can be useful for monitoring AVF maturation, they may not provide the necessary information to identify any underlying anatomical issues that require intervention.

Option D is incorrect because abandoning the AVF and placing an arteriovenous graft or catheter should be considered a last resort. Every effort should be made to salvage the AVF, as it is the preferred access for hemodialysis due to its lower complication rates and improved patient outcomes.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements regarding cinacalcet is CORRECT?,A,"The correct answer is C. Cinacalcet is associated with decreased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.

The patient's laboratory values indicate secondary hyperparathyroidism, which is a common complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The elevated PTH level (745 pg/ml) and alkaline phosphatase level (212 U/ml) suggest that the patient's parathyroid glands are overactive, leading to an imbalance in calcium and phosphorus levels.

Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic agent that is used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with ESRD. It works by increasing the sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor on the parathyroid gland, thereby reducing PTH production.

Studies have shown that cinacalcet therapy is associated with a decrease in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with ESRD and secondary hyperparathyroidism (EVOLVE trial, 2012).

Option A is incorrect because while cinacalcet may be appropriate for this patient, it is not the correct answer to the question.

Option B is incorrect because cinacalcet therapy has been shown to reduce serum phosphorus levels in patients with ESRD and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Option D is incorrect because cinacalcet therapy has been shown to reduce vascular calcification, not increase it.

Option E is incorrect because cinacalcet therapy can reduce PTH levels by up to 50% or more, not just 15% to 20%.",Success
Which of the following agents could be used for his osteoporosis?,C,"Based on the patient's medical history and laboratory results, I would recommend option C, Teriparatide.

Here's my reasoning:

* The patient has a history of osteoporosis, evidenced by multiple fractures, including a nontraumatic vertebral fracture.
* His PTH level is 120 pg/ml, which is elevated, indicating secondary hyperparathyroidism likely due to chronic kidney disease (CKD).
* The patient has been taking glucocorticoids for years, which can contribute to osteoporosis.
* The patient's bone-specific alkaline phosphatase is low, suggesting decreased bone turnover.
* Vitamin D levels are normal, and phosphorus levels are within normal range, indicating that vitamin D deficiency and hyperphosphatemia are not contributing to his osteoporosis.

Teriparatide, a recombinant human parathyroid hormone (PTH), is an anabolic agent that can stimulate bone formation and increase bone density. It is specifically indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in patients with a high risk of fracture, such as this patient.

Pamidronate (option A) is a bisphosphonate, which can inhibit bone resorption but may not be effective in this patient with low bone turnover.

Denosumab (option B) is a RANK ligand inhibitor that can also inhibit bone resorption, but it may not be the best choice for this patient with CKD and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Romosozumab (option D) is a sclerostin inhibitor that can stimulate bone formation, but it is not specifically indicated for patients with CKD and may have limited efficacy in this patient with low bone turnover.

In summary, Teriparatide is the most suitable option for this patient's osteoporosis, considering his medical history, laboratory results, and the need for an anabolic agent to stimulate bone formation.",Success
Which ONE of the following interventions is the next BEST step to reduce the frequency of CRBSIs in your unit?,B,"The correct answer is B. Use an alcohol-based chlorhexidine (0.5%) solution for cleansing the exit site skin, and scrub the hub with 70% alcohol.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend using a chlorhexidine-based solution for skin antisepsis to reduce the risk of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs), which includes CRBSIs. Chlorhexidine has been shown to be more effective than povidone-iodine in reducing the risk of CLABSIs.

Additionally, scrubbing the hub with 70% alcohol is also recommended to reduce the risk of bacterial colonization and subsequent infection.

While the other options may have some benefits, they are not the next best step in reducing CRBSIs in this scenario:

A. Transparent semi-permeable dressings can help with site visibility and patient comfort, but they do not address the primary issue of skin antisepsis.

C. Needle-free connectors can reduce the risk of hub colonization, but they are not a substitute for proper skin antisepsis and hub cleaning.

D. Gentamicin-citrate lock solution may be effective in reducing CRBSIs, but it is not recommended as a universal lock solution for all patients, and its use should be guided by individual patient needs and antibiotic stewardship principles.

E. Alteplase lock solution is not recommended for CRBSI prevention, and its use is typically reserved for treating occluded catheters.

By implementing chlorhexidine-based skin antisepsis and hub cleaning with 70% alcohol, the dialysis unit can take a significant step towards reducing the frequency of CRBSIs.",Success
Which of the following is the best response to this patient’s home readings?,D,"The correct answer is D. Recommend 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) to conﬁrm the presence of masked uncontrolled hypertension.

The patient's home BP readings are consistently 10-15 mmHg above his goal, which suggests that he may have masked uncontrolled hypertension. Masked hypertension is a condition where BP is normal in the office setting but elevated outside of the office. This can be due to various factors, including white-coat hypertension, anxiety, or stress.

Ignoring the readings (Option A) is not the best response, as it may lead to undertreatment of hypertension, which can worsen the patient's underlying conditions, such as CKD and heart failure.

Suspecting that the patient is not able to use appropriate measurement technique (Option B) may not be the primary concern, as the patient has been using the home BP monitor consistently and has reported elevated readings.

Adding spironolactone (Option C) may be premature, as it is essential to confirm the presence of masked uncontrolled hypertension before making any changes to the patient's medication regimen.

Recommendation of 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) (Option D) is the best response, as it can provide a more accurate picture of the patient's BP patterns throughout the day and night. ABPM can help diagnose masked uncontrolled hypertension and guide treatment decisions.",Success
Which ONE of the following ﬁndings on immunoﬂuorescence microscopy would MOST likely indicate a poor response to cortico-steroids and a poor long-term prognosis?,D,"The correct answer is D. IgM and C3 deposition.

In the context of primary FSGS, the presence of IgM and C3 deposition on immunofluorescence microscopy is associated with a poor response to corticosteroids and a poor long-term prognosis. This is because IgM and C3 deposition suggest a more aggressive and chronic inflammatory process, which may be less responsive to steroid therapy.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, the presence of IgM and C3 deposition is considered a poor prognostic factor in FSGS.

In contrast, the absence of IgM or C3 deposition (Option A) may indicate a more favorable response to steroids. IgM deposition only (Option B) may be seen in some cases of FSGS, but it is not as strongly associated with a poor prognosis as IgM and C3 deposition. C3 deposition only (Option C) is not typically associated with a poor prognosis in FSGS.

It's essential to note that the diagnosis and prognosis of FSGS should be made in conjunction with clinical, laboratory, and histopathological findings, and not solely based on immunofluorescence microscopy results.",Success
Which ONE of the following values corresponds to an approximate risk of kidney failure (per 100 patient years) for this patient?,B,"Based on the patient's response to treatment, specifically the significant decline in proteinuria from 3.1 g/day to 0.2 g/day, and stable serum creatinine level, the patient is considered to have a good response to therapy.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, patients with FSGS who achieve a complete remission (proteinuria <0.2 g/day) have a low risk of kidney failure.

A study published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2013) found that patients with FSGS who achieved a complete remission had a risk of kidney failure of approximately 1.4 per 100 patient years.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

D. 1.4 per 100 patient years",Success
Oxygen requirement,C,"The correct answer is C. Cause of kidney disease.

According to current literature, the following factors have been associated with increased risk of mortality in transplant recipients with COVID-19:

* Age (option 1): Advanced age is a well-established risk factor for severe COVID-19 and mortality in transplant recipients.
* Acute kidney injury (option 2): AKI has been linked to worse outcomes in transplant recipients with COVID-19.
* Lymphopenia (option 4): Lymphopenia is a common feature of COVID-19 and has been associated with increased mortality in transplant recipients.
* History of coronary artery disease (option 5): Cardiovascular disease is a known risk factor for severe COVID-19 and mortality.
* Oxygen requirement (not listed as an option, but mentioned in the scenario): The need for supplemental oxygen has been associated with increased mortality in transplant recipients with COVID-19.

However, the cause of kidney disease (option 3) has not been specifically identified as a risk factor for mortality in transplant recipients with COVID-19. The underlying kidney disease may impact the patient's overall health and response to infection, but it is not a direct predictor of mortality in this context.",Success
Which ONE of the following tests should be performed next?,A,"The correct answer is A. Cystoscopy and computed tomographic urogram if the cystoscopy is normal.

Here's the reasoning:

* The patient has asymptomatic hematuria, which is confirmed on repeated urinalysis, with dysmorphic erythrocytes suggesting a glomerular origin.
* The absence of albuminuria, normal serum creatinine, and normal kidney ultrasound make glomerulonephritis or chronic kidney disease less likely.
* The patient's age, smoking history, and moderately enlarged prostate raise the suspicion of a urologic malignancy, such as bladder cancer or kidney cancer.
* Cystoscopy is the next appropriate step to evaluate for bladder cancer, and if the cystoscopy is normal, a computed tomographic urogram (CTU) should be performed to evaluate the upper urinary tract for possible kidney cancer or other abnormalities.

The other options are not the next best step:

* Option B is not necessary, as the patient already has a normal urine albumin/creatinine ratio, which rules out significant albuminuria.
* Option C is not indicated, as there is no evidence of glomerulonephritis or systemic lupus erythematosus.
* Option D is not relevant, as there is no suspicion of multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders.

It's essential to investigate the cause of hematuria in this patient, especially given his age and risk factors, to rule out any potential urologic malignancies.",Success
Which ONE of the following ﬁndings would indicate that a primary form of the disorder is MOST likely present?,C,"The correct answer is C. Hyperexpression of PLA2R antigen by immunohistochemical studies of pronase-digested, paraffin-preserved specimens.

Membranous nephropathy is a type of glomerulonephritis that can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to other conditions, such as lupus or cancer. The presence of phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibodies is a strong indicator of primary membranous nephropathy.

Option C is correct because PLA2R is a specific antigen that is often overexpressed in primary membranous nephropathy. Immunohistochemical studies can detect this overexpression, which supports a diagnosis of primary membranous nephropathy.

Option A is incorrect because extensive deposition of C3 in the capillary loops is a non-specific finding that can be seen in various types of glomerulonephritis.

Option B is incorrect because coalescent electron-dense deposits in the subepithelial space are a characteristic feature of membranous nephropathy, but they do not distinguish between primary and secondary forms of the disease.

Option D is incorrect because IgG subclass 2 dominance of the IgG deposits is not a specific finding for primary membranous nephropathy, and the absence of PLA2R staining does not rule out a secondary form of the disease.

Option E is incorrect because increased infiltration of capillary loops by polymorphonuclear leukocytes is not a characteristic feature of membranous nephropathy and is more commonly seen in other types of glomerulonephritis, such as post-infectious glomerulonephritis.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell her about steroid elimination after the intra-operative steroid bolus following transplantation and the risk of diabetes mellitus?,A,"The correct answer is B. It will reduce her risk of becoming diabetic.

Steroid elimination, also known as steroid avoidance or early steroid withdrawal, is a strategy used in kidney transplantation to minimize the risks associated with long-term corticosteroid use, including post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM). Corticosteroids are known to increase blood glucose levels and contribute to the development of PTDM.

Studies have shown that steroid elimination or early steroid withdrawal regimens can reduce the incidence of PTDM in kidney transplant recipients. The benefits of steroid elimination include a lower risk of PTDM, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, as well as improved graft function and patient survival.

In this scenario, the patient's concern about developing diabetes after transplantation is valid, and informing her that steroid elimination may reduce her risk of becoming diabetic is an accurate and reassuring response.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell the radiologist regarding outcomes in delaying ﬁstula thrombectomy?,B,"The correct answer is B. Patients undergoing ﬁstula thrombectomy within 24 hours of diagnosis have higher patency rates at 3 months than do patients treated later.

According to current guidelines and evidence-based practices, prompt thrombectomy within 24 hours of diagnosis is associated with better outcomes, including higher patency rates at 3 months. Delaying thrombectomy beyond 24 hours may lead to decreased patency rates and potentially worse outcomes for the patient.

The other options are not supported by evidence:

A. While prompt thrombectomy is beneficial, there is no specific evidence to suggest that immediate procedural success is more likely when performed within 24 hours.

C. There is no conclusive evidence to suggest that thrombectomy performed > 48 hours after thrombosis diagnosis is associated with higher rates of complications.

D. While diabetes is a risk factor for arteriovenous fistula complications, there is no specific evidence to suggest that delaying thrombectomy > 48 hours in patients with diabetes adversely influences fistula patency at 3 and 6 months.

It is essential to prioritize prompt thrombectomy to ensure the best possible outcomes for the patient.",Success
What is the MOST likely mode of inheritance of this condition?,C,"Based on the family history, the most likely mode of inheritance of this condition is:

A. Autosomal dominant

The patient's maternal uncle developed end-stage kidney disease at age 40, and his maternal grandmother has stage 3a CKD. This suggests a pattern of inheritance that is consistent with autosomal dominance, where a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disease. The fact that the patient's mother did not develop kidney disease, but her brother and mother did, further supports this conclusion.

Autosomal recessive inheritance (option B) is less likely, as it would require that the patient inherits two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent), which is not supported by the family history.

X-linked recessive inheritance (option C) is also unlikely, as the patient's maternal uncle was affected, and X-linked recessive traits are typically passed from mother to son.

De novo somatic mutation (option D) is not supported by the family history, as there is a clear pattern of inheritance in the maternal line.

It's worth noting that the exact genetic cause of the patient's kidney disease is not specified in the scenario, but based on the family history, autosomal dominant inheritance is the most likely mode of inheritance.",Success
Which ONE of the following answers is MOST likely the correct cause of the patient’s hyponatremia?,A,"None of the options mention hyponatremia, which is a low sodium level. The patient's serum sodium is 155 mmol/L, which is actually hypernatremia (high sodium level).

Considering the patient's condition and laboratory results, the correct answer would be:

C. Hypernatremia is secondary to osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia

The patient's blood glucose level is 170 mg/dl, indicating hyperglycemia. This can cause an osmotic diuresis, leading to increased urine production and sodium retention, resulting in hypernatremia. The patient's urine output of 1300 ml in the past 24 hours and urine osmolarity of 629 mOsm/kg support this explanation.

It's essential to note that lithium can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, but in this scenario, the patient's urine osmolarity is not consistent with complete nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Additionally, the patient's hypernatremia is not iatrogenic, as it's not caused by excessive sodium administration.",Success
Which ONE of the following statements is MOST correct?,D,"The correct answer is D. C3GN in this patient is likely caused by an acquired autoantibody to components of the alternative complement pathway.

Here's why:

* The patient's biopsy shows a membranoproliferative pattern, which is consistent with C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN).
* The presence of 3+ C3 deposition and no IgG on immunofluorescence suggests that the disease is driven by an abnormal activation of the alternative complement pathway, rather than an immune complex-mediated process.
* The low C3 level and normal C4 level support this conclusion, as the alternative pathway is more likely to consume C3.
* The absence of IgG on biopsy does not exclude monoclonal gammopathy-associated C3GN, as some cases may not have IgG deposition (option B is incorrect).
* Monoclonal gammopathy is actually more common among patients with C3GN who are older than 50 (option A is incorrect).
* While heritable complement disorders can cause C3GN, the absence of a family history and the presence of acquired features (such as proteinuria and hematuria) make an acquired autoantibody more likely (option C is incorrect).

Current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices support the diagnosis of C3GN caused by an acquired autoantibody to components of the alternative complement pathway in this patient.",Success
Which ONE of the following regarding this man’s echocardiographic abnormalities is CORRECT?,D,"The correct answer is B. The elevated PASP is associated with an increased risk of progression to ESRD.

Here's why:

* Option A is incorrect because elevated PASP is actually common in stages 3 and 4 CKD, with a frequency of around 40-50% (Source: American Journal of Kidney Diseases, 2013).
* Option C is incorrect because eccentric LVH is still associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke (Source: European Heart Journal, 2018).
* Option D is incorrect because LVH is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death, not renal death specifically (Source: Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, 2017).

Elevated PASP is a known complication of CKD and is associated with an increased risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (Source: Kidney International, 2015). Therefore, option B is the correct answer.",Success
Which ONE of the following would you advise this patient with regard to sodium polystyrene sulfonate therapy?,A,"The correct answer is A. The frequency of colonic necrosis is approximately 0.1%.

Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (SPS) is a cation-exchange resin used to treat hyperkalemia by binding potassium in the gut and increasing its excretion. However, it carries a risk of colonic necrosis, a rare but potentially life-threatening complication. The estimated frequency of colonic necrosis associated with SPS use is around 0.1% to 0.3% (Source: UpToDate, ""Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate): Drug information"").

It is essential to inform the patient about this potential risk, especially in the context of his advanced age and underlying medical conditions.

Option B is incorrect because SPS should not be coadministered with other medications, especially antacids or laxatives, as it may reduce its efficacy or increase the risk of adverse effects.

Option C is incorrect because SPS is a recommended treatment for hyperkalemia in CKD patients, especially those who are not on dialysis (Source: Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease).

Option D is incorrect because while sorbitol-free preparations may reduce the risk of gastrointestinal side effects, they do not eliminate the risk of colonic necrosis.",Success
Which ONE of the following interventions has been shown to REDUCE the risk of delayed graft function?,A,"The correct answer is A. Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) of the explanted kidney.

Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) has been shown to reduce the risk of delayed graft function (DGF) in kidney transplantation, particularly in high-risk donors or prolonged cold ischemia times. HMP involves pumping a preservation solution through the kidney at a low temperature to maintain cellular metabolism and reduce ischemic injury. Studies have demonstrated that HMP can improve graft function and reduce the incidence of DGF compared to static cold storage.

The other options are not supported by evidence as effective interventions to reduce the risk of delayed graft function:

B. Dopamine infusion of the donor before procurement: While dopamine may help to increase renal blood flow and urine output in the donor, there is no evidence that it reduces the risk of DGF in the recipient.

C. Remote ischemic conditioning of the recipient (thigh occlusion): Remote ischemic conditioning has been studied as a potential intervention to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury, but its effectiveness in reducing DGF is unclear and requires further research.

D. Complement inhibition of the recipient at the time of transplant: Complement inhibition may be beneficial in reducing antibody-mediated rejection, but it is not specifically targeted at reducing DGF.

In this scenario, using HMP to preserve the kidney during transportation may help to reduce the risk of DGF, which is a significant concern given the high cPRA of the recipient and the prolonged cold ischemia time.",Success
Which ONE of the following BEST characterizes the expected role of medical director with regard to this clinical issue according to the United States Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Conditions for Coverage for ESRD facilities?,A,"The correct answer is A. Medical directors are responsible for the oversight of all care-related activities, including the high BSI and CVC rates at that facility.

According to the United States Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Conditions for Coverage for ESRD facilities, the medical director is responsible for the overall management and oversight of the facility's medical program, including the quality of care provided to patients. This includes ensuring that the facility has a quality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) program in place to identify and address performance issues, such as high bloodstream infection (BSI) rates and high rates of central venous catheter (CVC) use.

As the medical director, it is their responsibility to provide leadership and oversight to the QAPI program, which includes identifying and addressing the root causes of the high BSI and CVC rates, developing and implementing corrective actions, and monitoring the effectiveness of these actions.",Success
Which ONE of the following tests would you do next?,C,"The correct answer is B. Serum C3 nephritic factor.

The patient's kidney biopsy results are consistent with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), a type of glomerulonephritis characterized by abnormal proliferation of glomerular cells and deposition of immune complexes. The extensive C3 deposition in the mesangium and subendothelial areas, with only a trace of IgG/IgM deposition, suggests an alternative pathway of complement activation.

The next step in the evaluation would be to investigate the cause of the MPGN. Serum C3 nephritic factor (C3NeF) is an autoantibody that stabilizes the alternative pathway C3 convertase, leading to excessive C3 activation and consumption. C3NeF is a common cause of MPGN, especially in older adults.

The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis of MPGN or the evaluation of the patient's kidney biopsy results:

A. Serum anti-nuclear antibody and anti-dsDNA antibody are more relevant to the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, which is not suggested by the biopsy results.

C. Serum free light chain assay is used to evaluate for multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders, which is not a likely cause of MPGN in this patient.

D. Serum cryoglobulins are associated with cryoglobulinemia, a condition characterized by the presence of abnormal proteins in the blood that precipitate in cold temperatures. While cryoglobulinemia can cause kidney damage, it is not a common cause of MPGN.

Therefore, measuring serum C3 nephritic factor is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?,B,"The correct answer is A. Add empagliﬂozin.

This patient has progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) with a declining eGFR over the past 3 years, despite being on a regimen that includes an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) and a diuretic (chlorthalidone). The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled, and her LDL cholesterol is at goal. However, her hemoglobin A1c is 6.4%, indicating that her diabetes is not optimally controlled.

Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, has been shown to slow the progression of kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD. It is a recommended add-on therapy for patients with CKD and diabetes, especially those with a history of cardiovascular disease. In this case, adding empagliflozin to the patient's regimen would be a reasonable management decision.

Discontinuing metformin (option B) is not necessary, as it is still an effective medication for the patient's diabetes, and her eGFR is above the threshold for metformin use (30 ml/min per 1.73 m2).

Changing hydrochlorothiazide to furosemide (option C) is not indicated, as the patient does not have peripheral edema, and furosemide is typically used for more severe cases of heart failure or edema.

Discontinuing enalapril (option D) is not necessary, as ACE inhibitors are recommended for patients with CKD and diabetes to slow the progression of kidney disease. Lisinopril is still an effective medication for this patient's hypertension and CKD.",Success
Which mechanism explains how SNPs in the promoter region of uromodulin may predispose to hypertension?,C,"The correct answer is A. Decreased activity of Na-K-Cl cotransporter 2 (NKCC).

Uromodulin is a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. SNPs in the promoter region of uromodulin may lead to decreased expression of the protein, which can result in increased sodium reabsorption and, consequently, hypertension.

Na-K-Cl cotransporter 2 (NKCC2) is a key transporter involved in sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb. Decreased activity of NKCC2 would lead to reduced sodium reabsorption, not increased sodium reabsorption. However, decreased uromodulin expression can lead to increased NKCC2 activity, resulting in increased sodium reabsorption and hypertension.

The other options are not directly related to the mechanism of hypertension associated with SNPs in the promoter region of uromodulin:

* Option B: Prorenin receptor activity is involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which regulates blood pressure, but it is not directly related to uromodulin or sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb.
* Option C: TRPV5 is a calcium channel involved in calcium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule, which is a different segment of the nephron than the thick ascending limb, where uromodulin is expressed.
* Option D: Claudin-19 is a tight junction protein involved in paracellular transport, but its relationship to sodium reabsorption and hypertension is not well established.

This answer is supported by current evidence-based practices and medical guidelines, including the American Heart Association's guidelines on hypertension.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely cause of this man's hyperphosphatemia?,C,"The correct answer is C. Elevated IgG kappa monoclonal protein.

The patient's laboratory results show a significantly elevated serum IgG level (14,400 mg/dl) and serum free kappa-light chains (1288 mg/dl), indicating the presence of a monoclonal protein. In the context of mono-clonal Ig deposition disease, the elevated monoclonal protein is likely causing the hyperphosphatemia.

Tumor lysis syndrome (Option A) is unlikely, as the patient's lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid levels are within normal ranges, and there is no evidence of rapid tumor cell destruction.

Decreased GFR (Option B) may contribute to hyperphosphatemia, but the patient's eGFR is 55 ml/min per 1.73 m2, which is not severely impaired.

Bortezomib (Option D) is a proteasome inhibitor that can cause hyperphosphatemia, but it is less likely to be the primary cause in this scenario, given the patient's underlying monoclonal gammopathy.

Lenalidomide (Option E) is an immunomodulatory agent that is not typically associated with hyperphosphatemia.

In summary, the patient's hyperphosphatemia is most likely due to the elevated IgG kappa monoclonal protein, which is a characteristic feature of mono-clonal Ig deposition disease.",Success
"In addition to his MPO-ANCA status (as compared to PR3-ANCA), which ONE of the following BEST supports your conclusion?",C,"The correct answer is C. ANCA became undetectable after induction therapy.

The patient's MPO-ANCA status is already known to be a favorable factor for a lower risk of relapse compared to PR3-ANCA. Among the options, the fact that ANCA became undetectable after induction therapy (Option C) is a strong predictor of a low risk of relapse.

Studies have shown that achieving ANCA negativity after induction therapy is associated with a lower risk of relapse in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis. This is because ANCA titers are a marker of disease activity, and undetectable ANCA levels indicate a deeper remission.

Option A, having decreased but still positive ANCA titers, would actually suggest a higher risk of relapse. Option B, treatment with intravenous cyclophosphamide, is an effective induction regimen, but it does not specifically predict a low risk of relapse. Option D, treatment with plasma exchange, was part of the patient's induction regimen, but it is not a factor that directly influences the risk of relapse.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option C, ANCA became undetectable after induction therapy, which supports the conclusion of a low risk of relapse.",Success
"At this point, which ONE of the following would you expect on further laboratory assessment?",A,"Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, I would expect to see Hypophosphatemia (Option A) on further laboratory assessment.

Here's why:

* The patient's persistent emesis and muscle weakness suggest a possible electrolyte imbalance.
* The laboratory results show a low total CO2 level (21 mmol/L), which indicates a metabolic alkalosis. This can be caused by prolonged vomiting, which leads to a loss of hydrochloric acid and a subsequent increase in bicarbonate levels.
* In the setting of metabolic alkalosis, hypophosphatemia (low phosphate levels) is a common finding. This is because phosphate is an important buffer that helps regulate acid-base balance in the body.
* The patient's cannabis use is also relevant, as it can contribute to nausea and vomiting, which can further exacerbate the electrolyte imbalance.

The other options are less likely:

* Hyperkalemia (Option B) is unlikely given the patient's normal potassium level (3.7 mEq/L) on initial laboratory assessment.
* Hyperammonemia (Option C) is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.
* Hypoalbuminemia (Option D) is also unlikely, as the patient's physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual, and there is no indication of malnutrition or liver disease.

It's essential to note that further laboratory assessment, including phosphate levels, would be necessary to confirm this expectation.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell her about pancreas transplantation?,A,"The correct answer is B. Pancreas transplantation alone is associated with inferior outcomes compared with simultaneous kidney pancreas transplantation.

For a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease (ESRD), simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation (SPKT) is generally considered the best option. This is because SPKT can improve both renal function and glycemic control, reducing the risk of diabetic complications and improving quality of life.

Pancreas transplantation alone (PTA) is typically reserved for patients with type 1 diabetes who have near-normal renal function or are on dialysis but are not candidates for kidney transplantation. However, PTA has been associated with inferior outcomes compared to SPKT, including a higher risk of infections, rejection, and technical complications.

In this scenario, since the patient has stage G5 CKD, SPKT would be the more appropriate option. The brother's offer to be a living donor for kidney transplantation is a good opportunity to consider SPKT, which would provide the best long-term renal outcomes and improve glycemic control.

The other options are not accurate:

A. While living donor kidney transplantation followed by pancreas after kidney transplantation (PAKT) is an option, it is not the best approach for this patient. SPKT is generally preferred for patients with type 1 diabetes and ESRD.

C. Pancreas transplantation is not associated with a lower risk of infection compared to kidney transplantation alone. In fact, pancreas transplantation carries a higher risk of infection due to the complexity of the procedure and the need for immunosuppression.

D. The risk of BK viremia is not directly related to the type of transplantation (kidney or pancreas). BK viremia is a complication of immunosuppression, and the risk is similar for both kidney and pancreas transplant recipients.",Success
Which ONE of the following agents is the MOST appropriate direct oral anticoagulant to prevent stroke in this woman?,D,"The correct answer is D. Apixaban.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2018 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease, there is limited evidence to support the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and atrial fibrillation.

However, among the available DOACs, apixaban has been studied in patients with CKD and has a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile compared to the other options. The ARISTOTLE trial, which evaluated apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation, included patients with CKD and found that apixaban was effective and safe in this population.

Edoxaban (Option A) has not been extensively studied in patients with advanced CKD, and its use is not recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance <30 mL/min.

Dabigatran (Option B) is not recommended in patients with advanced CKD due to its primarily renal elimination and increased risk of bleeding.

Rivaroxaban (Option C) has been associated with increased bleeding risk in patients with CKD, particularly in those with a creatinine clearance <50 mL/min.

It's essential to note that even though apixaban may be the most appropriate DOAC in this scenario, the patient should be closely monitored for bleeding risk and renal function, and the decision to switch from warfarin should be made after a thorough discussion of the benefits and risks.",Success
Which ONE of the following genetic abnormalities BEST explains this clinical condition?,A,"The correct answer is B. A loss of function mutation in the calcium sensing receptor gene.

This patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with hypocalcemia, specifically familial hypocalcemia or autosomal dominant hypocalcemia (ADH). The presence of Chvostek and Trousseau signs, which are indicative of neuromuscular irritability, support this diagnosis.

A loss of function mutation in the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) gene is the most likely explanation for this clinical condition. The CaSR gene plays a crucial role in regulating calcium homeostasis by sensing changes in extracellular calcium levels. Mutations in the CaSR gene can lead to impaired calcium sensing, resulting in hypocalcemia.

Option A, a gain of function mutation in the CaSR gene, would more likely cause hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia.

Option C, a mutation in the AP2S1 gene, is associated with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, which is a different condition characterized by hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia.

Option D, a loss of function mutation in G-protein α-11, is not directly related to calcium homeostasis or hypocalcemia.

It's essential to note that genetic testing would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of ADH and identify the specific mutation.",Success
Which ONE of the following placed this patient at increased risk for encapsulating peritoneal ﬁbrosis?,D,"The correct answer is D. Recurrent and recent bacterial peritonitis.

Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is a rare but serious complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). It is characterized by the formation of a thick, fibrotic membrane around the intestines, leading to bowel obstruction and malnutrition.

According to current medical guidelines and evidence-based practices, recurrent and recent bacterial peritonitis is a well-established risk factor for the development of EPS. The patient's history of four episodes of PD-related peritonitis over the past two years, including the recent episode, increases her risk of developing EPS.

The other options are not directly related to the development of EPS:

A. PD vintage for < 5 years: EPS can occur at any time during PD, and the duration of PD is not a specific risk factor.

B. Absence of documented high average peritoneal transport characteristics: High peritoneal transport is a risk factor for EPS, but the absence of it does not increase the risk.

C. Warfarin anticoagulation: Warfarin is not a known risk factor for EPS.

It's essential to note that EPS is a severe complication of PD, and early recognition and management are crucial to improve patient outcomes.",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely diagnosis?,E,"Based on the patient's laboratory results and clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is:

E. Proximal renal tubular acidosis

Here's why:

* The patient has hypokalemic metabolic acidosis, which is consistent with a proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA).
* The urine pH is 5.0, which is not alkaline, ruling out distal RTA (type 1).
* The daily urine ammonium excretion is low (40 mmol), which is consistent with proximal RTA.
* The presence of low-molecular weight proteinuria on urine electrophoresis suggests proximal tubular dysfunction.
* The patient's medications, ruxolitinib and deferasirox, are not typically associated with RTA.
* The absence of a monoclonal spike on urine and serum electrophoresis makes tumor-induced osteomalacia (option B) less likely.
* The normal serum phosphorus level and low urinary phosphate level make spurious hypophosphatemia (option C) unlikely.
* The lack of gastrointestinal symptoms and normal serum bicarbonate level make bicarbonate loss through the gastrointestinal tract (option D) less likely.

Proximal RTA is a disorder characterized by impaired bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule, leading to metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and low-molecular weight proteinuria. It is often associated with underlying conditions such as myelodysplastic syndrome, which is consistent with the patient's medical history.",Success
"Based on the SPRINT data, all of the following are associated with failure to achieve intensive SBP target EXCEPT:",A,"Based on the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial) data, the correct answer is:

A. Younger age

According to the SPRINT trial, the factors associated with failure to achieve an intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) target of <120 mmHg include:

* Baseline SBP >140 mm Hg
* Greater number of antihypertensive medications
* Macroalbuminuria (not microalbuminuria, as mentioned in the patient's case)
* Preexisting CKD

Younger age, on the other hand, was not found to be associated with failure to achieve the intensive SBP target.

It's essential to note that the SPRINT trial focused on patients with hypertension and increased cardiovascular risk, similar to the patient in this scenario. The trial's findings can help guide management decisions for this patient.",Success
Which ONE of the following should you tell her about statin therapy and outcomes after kidney transplantation?,A,"The correct answer is A. Statin therapy after transplantation is associated with improved survival after transplantation.

According to the Assessment of Lescol in Renal Transplantation (ALERT) study, statin therapy after kidney transplantation is associated with improved patient survival and reduced cardiovascular events (1). The study found that fluvastatin therapy reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and improved patient survival in kidney transplant recipients.

The other options are incorrect:

B. While statin therapy does reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, it is also associated with improved survival after transplantation.

C. Immunosuppression can affect lipid levels, but statin therapy is still effective in reducing cardiovascular risk and improving outcomes after transplantation.

D. The dose of statin therapy may impact outcomes, with higher doses potentially being more effective in reducing cardiovascular risk.

It's essential to discuss the benefits and risks of statin therapy with the patient, considering her previous experience with myalgias while taking atorvastatin. A lower dose or alternative statin may be considered to minimize the risk of adverse effects while still providing cardiovascular benefits.

What is the correct statement regarding the cause of and diagnostic workup for hypotonic polyuria?,B,"The correct answer is B. Hypertonic saline infusion test and resultant copeptin release will accurately differentiate between central diabetes insipidus and primary polydipsia.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms of increased thirst and urination, along with laboratory results showing hypotonic polyuria (high urine output with low urine osmolarity), suggest a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. The differential diagnosis includes central diabetes insipidus (CDI), nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), and primary polydipsia.

Option B is correct because the hypertonic saline infusion test, also known as the water deprivation test, is a diagnostic tool used to differentiate between CDI and primary polydipsia. During this test, the patient is deprived of fluids, and then hypertonic saline is infused. In CDI, the release of copeptin (a precursor to vasopressin) will be low or absent, whereas in primary polydipsia, copeptin levels will increase in response to the hypertonic saline infusion.

Option A is incorrect because the indirect water deprivation test is not a reliable method to differentiate between CDI and primary polydipsia.

Option C is incorrect because, although hypercalcemia can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the patient's calcium level is within normal range (8.7 mg/dl). Moreover, the patient's history of pulmonary sarcoidosis does not necessarily imply that hypercalcemia is the cause of his symptoms.

Option D is incorrect because copeptin levels after a water deprivation test can help diagnose CDI, but it is not a reliable method to differentiate between CDI and primary polydipsia.

It's essential to note that a thorough diagnostic workup, including imaging studies and hormonal assays, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of diabetes insipidus.",Success
"In studies of patients with CKD and ESKD, which ONE of the following is CORRECT?",B,"The correct answer is B. Development of SHPT is associated with increased major cardiovascular events and death.

Studies have consistently shown that secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Elevated PTH levels have been linked to vascular calcification, cardiac hypertrophy, and increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure.

The other options are not correct:

A. While there is some evidence suggesting a U-shaped association between PTH levels and mortality, the exact threshold of 1200 pg/ml is not a universally accepted cutoff, and the 11% shorter lifespan is not a widely cited figure.

C. Older age, female sex, and hypertension are not established predictors of SHPT development.

D. SHPT has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of CKD progression, as elevated PTH levels can contribute to further kidney damage and fibrosis.

It's essential to counsel the patient about the potential risks associated with SHPT, including cardiovascular complications, and to emphasize the importance of managing their PTH levels and underlying CKD to reduce these risks.",Success
"In addition to intravenous albumin, which ONE of the following is the next MOST appropriate step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Midodrine plus octreotide or terlipressin alone.

The patient has hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a complication of cirrhosis characterized by oliguric acute kidney injury (AKI) and marked abnormalities in arterial blood pressure regulation. The goal of management is to improve renal function and reduce mortality.

In addition to intravenous albumin, which is already being administered, the next most appropriate step would be to use vasoconstrictors to increase the mean arterial pressure (MAP). Midodrine, an alpha-agonist, and octreotide, a somatostatin analog, have been shown to improve renal function and reduce mortality in patients with HRS. Terlipressin, a vasopressin analog, is also an option.

Norepinephrine (Option A) is not the best choice as it may exacerbate vasoconstriction and worsen renal function. Dopamine (Option C) has not been shown to be effective in HRS and may have negative effects on cardiac function. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) (Option D) is a procedure used to manage portal hypertension, but it is not the next most appropriate step in managing this patient's HRS.

This answer is supported by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) clinical practice guidelines for the management of hepatorenal syndrome, which recommend the use of vasoconstrictors, such as midodrine, octreotide, and terlipressin, in combination with albumin, to improve renal function and reduce mortality in patients with HRS.",Success
