"A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?",C,"The correct answer is B. Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report.

This scenario raises important ethical and professional issues in medicine. As a healthcare provider, it is essential to prioritize transparency, honesty, and patient autonomy. The attending physician's suggestion to withhold information from the patient and omit it from the operative report is unacceptable.

The American Medical Association (AMA) Code of Medical Ethics states that ""physicians have an ethical obligation to disclose to patients information about adverse events, including errors, that affect them"" (AMA Code of Medical Ethics, Opinion 3.2.1). The Joint Commission also emphasizes the importance of transparent communication about adverse events, including near misses and errors, to promote patient safety and trust.

As a resident, it is crucial to prioritize ethical principles and professional standards over the attending physician's instructions. The correct course of action is to disclose the error to the patient in a compassionate and honest manner, ensuring that they are fully informed about their care. Additionally, the error should be accurately documented in the operative report to maintain a complete and accurate medical record.

Options A, C, D, and E are incorrect because:

A. Disclosing the error to the patient but leaving it out of the operative report is incomplete and unethical.

C. Telling the attending that you cannot fail to disclose the mistake may lead to a confrontation, but it does not address the primary issue of patient disclosure and documentation.

D. Reporting the physician to the ethics committee may be considered if the attending physician's behavior is a pattern of unethical conduct, but it is not the primary action to take in this scenario.

E. Refusing to dictate the operative report is not a constructive or professional response and may lead to further complications.",Success
A 67-year-old man with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of ringing sensation in his ear. He received this first course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 week ago. Pure tone audiometry shows a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB. The expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to which of the following actions?,E,"The correct answer is C. Hyperstabilization of microtubules.

The patient's symptoms, specifically the ringing sensation in the ear (tinnitus) and sensorineural hearing loss, are indicative of ototoxicity, a common side effect of certain chemotherapeutic agents. Given the patient's diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder and the timing of the symptoms (1 week after the first course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy), it is likely that the patient received cisplatin, a platinum-based chemotherapy agent known to cause ototoxicity.

Cisplatin's mechanism of action involves forming DNA adducts, which leads to cross-linking of DNA (option E). However, this is not the expected beneficial effect of cisplatin. The correct answer is option C, hyperstabilization of microtubules, which is not a mechanism of action of cisplatin. Instead, it is a mechanism of action of taxanes, such as paclitaxel, which are also used in cancer treatment.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the mechanism of action of cisplatin:

A. Inhibition of thymidine synthesis is a mechanism of action of antimetabolite chemotherapy agents, such as 5-fluorouracil.

B. Inhibition of proteasome is a mechanism of action of proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib, used in the treatment of multiple myeloma.

D. Generation of free radicals is a mechanism of action of some chemotherapy agents, but it is not specifically related to cisplatin or the patient's symptoms.

In summary, the correct answer is option C, hyperstabilization of microtubules, which is not a mechanism of action of cisplatin, but rather a mechanism of action of taxanes.",Success
"Two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catherization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man has decreased urinary output and malaise. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin and naproxen. He was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Examination shows mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin count 14 g/dL
Leukocyte count 16,400/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 56%
Eosinophils 11%
Lymphocytes 31%
Monocytes 2%
Platelet count 260,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 68 mm/h
Serum
Urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL
Creatinine 4.2 mg/dL
Renal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?""",C,"The correct answer is C. Cholesterol embolization.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including decreased urinary output, malaise, and mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet, are consistent with a diagnosis of cholesterol embolization. This condition occurs when cholesterol plaques from the aorta or other large arteries break off and travel to smaller arteries, causing occlusion and ischemia.

The laboratory studies support this diagnosis:

* The patient's eosinophil count is elevated (11%), which is a common finding in cholesterol embolization.
* The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is elevated, indicating inflammation.
* The renal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles, which are characteristic of cholesterol emboli.

The other options are less likely:

A. Renal papillary necrosis is a condition that typically occurs in patients with diabetes and is characterized by necrosis of the renal papillae. While the patient has diabetes, the biopsy findings and eosinophilia are not consistent with this diagnosis.

B. Allergic interstitial nephritis is a condition that typically occurs in response to a medication or other allergen. While the patient is taking several medications, the biopsy findings and eosinophilia are not consistent with this diagnosis.

D. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a rare condition characterized by eosinophilia, granulomas, and vasculitis. While the patient has eosinophilia, the biopsy findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

E. Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis that can affect multiple organs, including the kidneys. While the patient has some features consistent with vasculitis, the biopsy findings and eosinophilia are not consistent with this diagnosis.

In summary, the patient's symptoms, laboratory studies, and biopsy findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of cholesterol embolization, which is a known complication of cardiac catheterization.",Success
"A 39-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of fevers, chills, and left lower quadrant pain. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.3°F), pulse is 126/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. There is blood oozing around the site of a peripheral intravenous line. Pelvic examination shows mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os and left adnexal tenderness. Laboratory studies show:
Platelet count 14,200/mm3
Fibrinogen 83 mg/mL (N = 200–430 mg/dL)
D-dimer 965 ng/mL (N < 500 ng/mL)
When phenol is applied to a sample of the patient's blood at 90°C, a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain is identified. A blood culture is most likely to show which of the following?""",D,"The correct answer is B. Encapsulated, gram-negative coccobacilli forming grey-colored colonies on charcoal blood agar.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a severe infection, likely sepsis, with a coagulopathy. The presence of mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os and left adnexal tenderness points towards a genital tract infection. The laboratory results show thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimer, which are consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The key to this question is the identification of a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain when phenol is applied to the patient's blood at 90°C. This is a characteristic of the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of Neisseria meningitidis.

Neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative coccobacillus that grows on charcoal blood agar, forming grey-colored colonies. It's also encapsulated, which is important for its pathogenesis.

The other options do not match the description:

A. Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci forming mauve-colored colonies on methicillin-containing agar describe Staphylococcus aureus, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

C. Spore-forming, gram-positive bacilli forming yellow colonies on casein agar describe Bacillus species, which are not typically associated with genital tract infections or sepsis.

D. Lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rods forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar describe Enterobacteriaceae, such as E. coli, which may cause genital tract infections but do not match the LOS description.

E. Gamma-hemolytic, gram-positive cocci forming green colonies on vancomycin agar describe Enterococcus species, which are not consistent with the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Encapsulated, gram-negative coccobacilli forming grey-colored colonies on charcoal blood agar, which is consistent with Neisseria meningitidis.",Success
"A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of itchy, watery eyes for the past week. He has also been sneezing multiple times a day during this period. He had a similar episode 1 year ago around springtime. He has iron deficiency anemia and ankylosing spondylitis. Current medications include ferrous sulfate, artificial tear drops, and indomethacin. He works as an elementary school teacher. His vital signs are within normal limits. Visual acuity is 20/20 without correction. Physical examination shows bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge. The pupils are 3 mm, equal, and reactive to light. Examination of the anterior chamber of the eye is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",B,"The correct answer is B. Ketotifen eye drops.

The patient's symptoms of itchy, watery eyes, and sneezing multiple times a day, particularly during springtime, suggest an allergic reaction, likely allergic conjunctivitis. The physical examination findings of bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge further support this diagnosis.

Ketotifen is an antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer that is commonly used to treat allergic conjunctivitis. It is available over-the-counter (OTC) and is effective in reducing symptoms of itching, redness, and tearing.

Here's why the other options are not the most appropriate treatment:

A. Erythromycin ointment is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, which is not the likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

C. Warm compresses may provide some relief from itching and discomfort, but they do not address the underlying allergic reaction.

D. Fluorometholone eye drops are a corticosteroid that can be used to treat inflammatory conditions, but they are not typically used as a first-line treatment for allergic conjunctivitis. Additionally, they can have side effects, such as increased intraocular pressure, and may not be suitable for long-term use.

E. Latanoprost eye drops are a prostaglandin analog used to treat glaucoma, which is not the patient's diagnosis.

It's worth noting that the patient's medications, including ferrous sulfate, artificial tear drops, and indomethacin, are not likely to be contributing to his symptoms, and there is no indication to change or stop these medications.",Success
A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of progressively worsening chest pain and nausea that started at a local bar 30 minutes prior. The pain radiates to the epigastric area. He has a 5-year history of untreated hypertension. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 5 years and started abusing cocaine 2 weeks before his emergency room visit. The patient is diaphoretic and in marked distress. What should be the first step in management?,E,"The correct answer is C. Nitroglycerin.

This patient is presenting with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), likely due to cocaine-induced coronary artery vasospasm. The patient's history of hypertension, smoking, and recent cocaine use increases his risk for cardiovascular events.

The first step in management should be to administer nitroglycerin, which is a vasodilator that can help relieve coronary artery vasospasm and reduce cardiac workload. Nitroglycerin is a recommended initial therapy for ACS, especially in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain.

Option A, Diltiazem, is a calcium channel blocker that can be used for rate control in atrial fibrillation, but it is not the first-line therapy for ACS.

Option B, Labetalol, is a beta blocker that can be used to control hypertension and tachycardia, but it may not be the best initial choice in this scenario, as it can exacerbate cocaine-induced vasospasm.

Option D, Propranolol, is a non-selective beta blocker that is contraindicated in cocaine-associated chest pain, as it can worsen vasospasm and increase the risk of cardiac ischemia.

Option E, Reassurance and continuous monitoring, is not an appropriate initial response, as the patient's symptoms suggest a potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt medical intervention.

According to current medical guidelines, including the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA), nitroglycerin is a recommended initial therapy for ACS, especially in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain.",Success
A 68-year-old male comes to the physician for evaluation of right flank pain. He has a history of diabetes and peripheral artery disease. His blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows abdominal tenderness and right flank tenderness. An ultrasound shows dilation of the right ureter and renal pelvis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?,D,"The correct answer is B. Benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as right flank pain and abdominal tenderness, are consistent with hydronephrosis (dilation of the renal pelvis and ureter). The ultrasound findings support this diagnosis. The most likely underlying cause of hydronephrosis in this patient is benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

BPH is a common condition in older men, and it can cause obstruction of the urinary tract, leading to hydronephrosis. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms or findings suggestive of other conditions make BPH the most likely cause.

Let's rule out the other options:

A. Renal artery stenosis: This condition would not typically cause hydronephrosis or flank pain.

C. Diabetic nephropathy: While the patient has diabetes, diabetic nephropathy typically causes kidney damage and proteinuria, not hydronephrosis.

D. Common iliac artery aneurysm: This condition would not typically cause hydronephrosis or flank pain.

E. Urethral stricture: This condition would cause urinary retention and difficulty urinating, not hydronephrosis or flank pain.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of peripheral artery disease may increase his risk of other vascular conditions, but it's not directly related to the hydronephrosis in this case.",Success
"A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after the onset of acute chest pain. He has hypertension and asthma. Current medications include atorvastatin, lisinopril, and an albuterol inhaler. He appears pale and diaphoretic. His pulse is 114/min and blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg. An ECG shows ST-segment depressions in leads II, III, and aVF. Laboratory studies show an increased serum troponin T concentration. The patient is treated for acute coronary syndrome and undergoes percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. At the time of discharge, echocardiography shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 58%. In addition to aspirin, which of the following drugs should be added to this patient's medication regimen?",C,"The correct answer is C. Clopidogrel.

Rationale:

The patient has been diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and has undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). According to current guidelines, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is recommended for patients with ACS who have undergone PTCA. Aspirin is already part of the patient's regimen, and clopidogrel is the recommended P2Y12 inhibitor to be added to aspirin for DAPT.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months in patients with ACS who have undergone PTCA, unless there are contraindications or high bleeding risk.

The other options are not correct:

A. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker, which may be used for hypertension or angina, but it is not indicated for ACS or as part of DAPT.

B. Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin, which may be used for anticoagulation in ACS, but it is not a long-term medication and is not part of DAPT.

D. Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, which may be used in patients with heart failure, but it is not indicated for ACS or as part of DAPT.

E. Propranolol is a beta blocker, which may be used for hypertension, angina, or heart failure, but it is not part of DAPT, and its use in ACS is generally reserved for patients with hypertension or tachycardia.

In summary, clopidogrel is the correct answer, as it is the recommended P2Y12 inhibitor to be added to aspirin for DAPT in patients with ACS who have undergone PTCA.",Success
"A 37-year-old-woman presents to her primary care physician requesting a new form of birth control. She has been utilizing oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for the past 8 years, but asks to switch to an intrauterine device (IUD). Her vital signs are: blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg, pulse 73/min and respiratory rate 16/min. She is afebrile. Physical examination is within normal limits. Which of the following past medical history statements would make copper IUD placement contraindicated in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Copper IUDs, such as ParaGard, are a type of intrauterine device that releases copper ions to prevent pregnancy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), copper IUD placement is contraindicated in women with active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) due to the risk of exacerbating the infection.

The other options are not contraindications for copper IUD placement:

A. A history of stroke or venous thromboembolism is a contraindication for hormonal contraceptives, such as OCPs, but not for copper IUDs.

B. Current tobacco use is a risk factor for many health conditions, but it is not a contraindication for copper IUD placement.

D. Past medical history of breast cancer is not a contraindication for copper IUD placement, as copper IUDs do not contain hormones that could stimulate breast cancer growth.

E. Known liver neoplasm is not a contraindication for copper IUD placement, as copper IUDs do not affect liver function or liver cancer.

It's essential to note that copper IUDs are generally safe and effective for most women, but it's crucial to evaluate each patient's medical history and current health status to determine the best contraceptive option for them.",Success
A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because she is embarrassed about the appearance of her nails. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She appears well. A photograph of the nails is shown. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?,A,"The correct answer is C. Erosions of the dental enamel.

The photograph of the nails is not provided, but based on the patient's complaint about the appearance of her nails, it is likely that she has Beau's lines or nail pitting, which are common findings in patients with alopecia areata. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition that causes hair loss, and it is often associated with other autoimmune disorders, such as vitiligo and atopic dermatitis.

Option C, erosions of the dental enamel, is a common finding in patients with alopecia areata. This is because the autoimmune process can also affect the teeth, leading to enamel erosion and sensitivity.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's nail appearance or alopecia areata:

A. Silvery plaques on extensor surfaces are characteristic of psoriasis, which may cause nail changes, but it is not directly related to the patient's complaint.

B. Flesh-colored papules in the lumbosacral region are characteristic of keratosis pilaris, a benign skin condition that is not typically associated with nail changes.

D. Pallor of the conjunctival mucosa is a sign of anemia, which is not directly related to the patient's nail appearance.

E. Holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border is a cardiac finding that is not related to the patient's nail appearance or alopecia areata.

Therefore, based on the patient's complaint and the likely diagnosis of alopecia areata, option C, erosions of the dental enamel, is the most likely additional finding.",Success
"A 24-year-old G2P1 woman at 39 weeks’ gestation presents to the emergency department complaining of painful contractions occurring every 10 minutes for the past 2 hours, consistent with latent labor. She says she has not experienced vaginal discharge, bleeding, or fluid leakage, and is currently taking no medications. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 86/min, and temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F). She has had little prenatal care and uses condoms inconsistently. Her sexually transmitted infections status is unknown. As part of the patient’s workup, she undergoes a series of rapid screening tests that result in the administration of zidovudine during delivery. The infant is also given zidovudine to reduce the risk of transmission. A confirmatory test is then performed in the mother to confirm the diagnosis of HIV. Which of the following is most true about the confirmatory test?",E,"The correct answer is E. It is an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay.

The scenario describes a patient who undergoes rapid screening tests for HIV during labor, which leads to the administration of zidovudine to reduce the risk of transmission to the infant. A confirmatory test is then performed to confirm the diagnosis of HIV.

The correct answer is option E, which states that the confirmatory test is an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay. This is consistent with current guidelines, which recommend that a positive rapid HIV test result be confirmed with a more specific test, such as an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay, also known as a Western blot or immunoblot.

The other options are incorrect:

A. Determining the genotype of the virus is not the primary purpose of a confirmatory test in this scenario.

B. A Western blot (not Southwestern blot) is a type of confirmatory test that detects the presence of antibodies against HIV, but it does not specifically identify DNA-binding proteins.

C. A Northern blot is a laboratory technique used to detect specific RNA sequences, but it is not typically used for HIV diagnosis or confirmation.

D. This option is incorrect, as a Northern blot is used for RNA detection, not DNA.

It's worth noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend that all pregnant women be screened for HIV during pregnancy, and that rapid HIV testing be performed during labor if the patient's HIV status is unknown.",Success
"A 72-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue and worsening abdominal pain.

Mean corpuscular volume 85 μm3
Leukocyte count 5,200/mm3
Platelet count 96,000/mm3
A blood smear is shown. Bone marrow aspiration shows extensive fibrosis and a few scattered plasma cells. A JAK 2 assay is positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",D,"The correct answer is D. Ruxolitinib.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and bone marrow aspiration findings are consistent with Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF), a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm. The presence of a JAK2 mutation, which is a common genetic abnormality in PMF, further supports this diagnosis.

Ruxolitinib is a JAK1/2 inhibitor that is specifically approved for the treatment of intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis, including PMF. It has been shown to reduce spleen size, improve symptoms, and enhance quality of life in patients with myelofibrosis.

The other options are not the most appropriate next step in management for the following reasons:

A. Cladribine is a chemotherapy agent that is not typically used to treat PMF.

B. Prednisone may be used to manage some symptoms associated with PMF, such as anemia or thrombocytopenia, but it is not a disease-modifying therapy for PMF.

C. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), not PMF.

E. Stem cell transplantation may be considered for some patients with PMF, particularly those who are younger and have a suitable donor. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient, given his age and the availability of other treatment options.

It's worth noting that the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend JAK2 inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, as a first-line treatment for intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis.",Success
A 20-year-old man comes to the physician because of worsening gait unsteadiness and bilateral hearing loss for 1 month. He has had intermittent tingling sensations on both cheeks over this time period. He has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications. Audiometry shows bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Genetic evaluation shows a mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes merlin. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions?,B,"The correct answer is B. Meningioma.

The patient's symptoms, including worsening gait unsteadiness, bilateral hearing loss, and intermittent tingling sensations on both cheeks, are consistent with a diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2). The genetic evaluation showing a mutation of the tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22, which encodes merlin, further supports this diagnosis.

NF2 is a rare genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 60,000 people. It is characterized by the growth of non-cancerous tumors, called schwannomas, on the nerves responsible for hearing and balance. These tumors can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance problems.

The mutation of the merlin gene is a hallmark of NF2, and it increases the risk of developing meningiomas, which are benign tumors that arise from the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. In fact, approximately 50% of people with NF2 will develop meningiomas.

The other options are not directly related to NF2 or the merlin gene mutation:

A. Renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer, which is not typically associated with NF2.

C. Astrocytoma is a type of brain tumor that can occur in people with NF2, but it is not as strongly associated with the condition as meningiomas.

D. Vascular malformations are not a characteristic feature of NF2.

E. Telangiectasias are small, dilated blood vessels that can occur in various conditions, but they are not specifically associated with NF2.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Meningioma.",Success
"A 47-year-old executive schedules an appointment his physician for a routine medical check-up. He currently has no complaints and claims to be “as fit as a fiddle.” The physical examination findings are unremarkable, except for a mid-systolic murmur heard in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids on auscultation. The physician instructs the patient to stand from a supine position with the stethoscope still placed on his chest. Which of the following changes would occur with this maneuver?",E,"The correct answer is E. A reduction in diastolic filling time.

Here's why:

The murmur described in the question is consistent with aortic stenosis, which is a narrowing of the aortic valve that obstructs blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. The murmur is heard in the 2nd left intercostal space, which is a common location for aortic stenosis murmurs, and radiates to the carotids, which is also consistent with aortic stenosis.

When the patient stands up from a supine position, several physiological changes occur:

* Venous return to the heart decreases due to gravity, which reduces right atrial pressure (option A).
* Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (option B) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (option C) also decrease due to decreased venous return.
* The slope of the pacemaker potential (option D) is not directly affected by standing up.

The correct answer, option E, is a reduction in diastolic filling time. When the patient stands up, the heart rate increases to compensate for the decreased venous return, which reduces the time available for diastolic filling. This is because the heart has to pump more frequently to maintain cardiac output, leaving less time for the ventricles to fill with blood during diastole.

This response is grounded in current medical guidelines and is consistent with the physiological changes that occur with standing up from a supine position.",Success
"A microbiologist is studying the emergence of a virulent strain of the virus. After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection. Which of the following viruses is capable of undergoing the above-mentioned process?",D,"The correct answer is D. Rotavirus.

The process described in the question is called reassortment, which is a mechanism of genetic recombination that occurs in certain viruses, including rotaviruses. Reassortment involves the exchange of genome segments between two different viruses that infect the same host cell, resulting in the formation of a new virus particle with a unique combination of genome segments.

Rotaviruses, which are members of the Reoviridae family, are known to undergo reassortment. They have a segmented double-stranded RNA genome, which makes them prone to reassortment. This process can lead to the emergence of new rotavirus strains with altered virulence or antigenicity.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a DNA virus that does not undergo reassortment.

B. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a DNA virus that does not undergo reassortment.

C. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that undergoes recombination, but not reassortment.

E. Vaccinia virus is a DNA virus that does not undergo reassortment.

It's worth noting that reassortment is a unique feature of certain RNA viruses, including rotaviruses, influenza viruses, and bunyaviruses.",Success
"A 59-year-old overweight woman presents to the urgent care clinic with the complaint of severe abdominal pain for the past 2 hours. She also complains of a dull pain in her back with nausea and vomiting several times. Her pain has no relation with food. Her past medical history is significant for recurrent abdominal pain due to cholelithiasis. Her father died at the age of 60 with some form of abdominal cancer. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical exam is unremarkable. However, a CT scan of the abdomen shows a calcified mass near her gallbladder. Which of the following diagnoses should be excluded first in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Gallbladder cancer.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, are non-specific and could be attributed to various conditions. However, the CT scan finding of a calcified mass near the gallbladder raises a red flag for gallbladder cancer. Given the patient's family history of abdominal cancer, it's essential to exclude gallbladder cancer as a potential diagnosis.

While acute cholecystitis (A) is a possibility, the patient's symptoms are not typical of acute cholecystitis, which usually presents with right upper quadrant pain that worsens with deep inspiration (Murphy's sign). Choledocholithiasis (C) is also a possibility, but the CT scan finding of a calcified mass near the gallbladder makes gallbladder cancer a more pressing concern. Pancreatitis (D) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings. Duodenal peptic ulcer (E) is not supported by the patient's symptoms or the CT scan findings.

According to the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines, patients with a calcified mass near the gallbladder should undergo further evaluation to rule out gallbladder cancer. This may include additional imaging studies, such as MRI or PET scans, and potentially, a biopsy.

He is currently on a β-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen. Which of the following mediators is described in this experimental study?",E,"The correct answer is E. IL-4.

Here's why:

The scenario describes a boy with asthma, and the experimental therapy aims to attenuate the activity of a mediator that contributes to his asthmatic attacks, particularly during springtime when pollen counts are high. The mediator in question favors class switching of antibodies, which is a key feature of the immune response to allergens.

IL-4 is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the development of allergic responses, including asthma. It promotes the class switching of antibodies from IgM to IgE, which is a hallmark of allergic reactions. IgE antibodies bind to allergens, such as pollen, and trigger the release of inflammatory mediators, leading to asthmatic symptoms. By reducing IL-4 activity, the experimental therapy aims to decrease the exaggerated response to allergens and alleviate the boy's symptoms.

The other options are not directly related to class switching of antibodies or the allergic response:

A. IL-5 is involved in eosinophil activation and recruitment, which is important in asthma, but it doesn't directly influence antibody class switching.

B. IL-2 is a T-cell growth factor that plays a role in immune responses, but it's not specifically linked to allergic reactions or antibody class switching.

C. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can suppress immune responses, but it's not directly involved in antibody class switching or allergic reactions.

D. IL-13 is another cytokine involved in allergic responses, but it's more closely related to airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus production, rather than antibody class switching.

Therefore, the correct answer is IL-4, which is the mediator that favors class switching of antibodies and is a key player in the allergic response underlying the boy's asthma symptoms.",Success
"A 3-month-old boy is brought the emergency department by his parents after an episode of cyanosis and muscle hypotonia that resolved after 2 minutes. Diagnostic evaluation fails to discover an exact etiology of the boy's symptoms and the episode is classified as a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). The risk profile for BRUE in infants remains largely unknown. The pediatrician who saw the boy in the emergency department is trying to identify risk factors for BRUE. She is aware of several confounders, including age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She recruits 75 infants under 1 year of age with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE of the same age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She then compares the two groups with regard to history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection. Which of the following methods was conducted to control confounding bias in the study?",E,"The correct answer is E. Matching.

In this study, the pediatrician recruited 75 infants with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE, matching them on age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. This is an example of matching, which is a method used to control confounding bias by ensuring that the groups being compared are similar in terms of potential confounding variables.

Matching helps to reduce confounding bias by creating groups that are comparable in terms of factors that could influence the outcome, allowing the researcher to isolate the effect of the variable of interest (in this case, history of feeding problems and recent upper respiratory infection).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Stratified analysis: This involves dividing the data into subgroups based on confounding variables and analyzing the effect of the variable of interest within each subgroup. While stratified analysis can be used to control confounding bias, it is not the method used in this study.

B. Blinding: This involves concealing information from participants or researchers to reduce bias. Blinding is not relevant to controlling confounding bias in this study.

C. Restriction: This involves limiting the study population to a specific subgroup to reduce confounding bias. While restriction can be used to control confounding bias, it is not the method used in this study.

D. Randomization: This involves randomly assigning participants to treatment or control groups to reduce confounding bias. Randomization is not used in this study, as the researcher is comparing two existing groups (infants with and without BRUE).

By matching the groups on potential confounding variables, the researcher has controlled for confounding bias and can more confidently attribute any differences between the groups to the variables of interest (history of feeding problems and recent upper respiratory infection).",Success
"A 29-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to central chest pain over the past 3 days which is constant and unrelated to exertion. The pain is sharp, severe, increases when lying down, and improves with leaning forward. The pain also radiates to his shoulders and neck. The patient has no past medical history. He has smoked 10 cigarettes per day for the past 7 years and occasionally drinks alcohol. He presents with vital signs: blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, regular radial pulse of 95/min, and temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F). On physical exam, a scratching sound of to-and-from character is audible over the left sternal border at end-expiration with the patient leaning forward. His chest X-ray is normal and ECG is shown in the picture. Which of the following is the optimal therapy for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is A. Indomethacin +/- omeprazole.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with acute pericarditis, an inflammation of the pericardium, the sac surrounding the heart. The characteristic scratching sound, known as a pericardial friction rub, is audible over the left sternal border, which is a key diagnostic feature.

The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in multiple leads, which is a common finding in acute pericarditis. The patient's symptoms and ECG findings are not suggestive of a myocardial infarction or other cardiac conditions.

The optimal therapy for acute pericarditis is anti-inflammatory treatment. Indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is a first-line agent for treating acute pericarditis. Omeprazole may be added to prevent gastrointestinal side effects.

Option B is incorrect because while ibuprofen is also an NSAID, colchicine is typically used for recurrent pericarditis, not acute pericarditis.

Option C is incorrect because prednisone is a corticosteroid that may be used for refractory or recurrent pericarditis, but it is not the first-line therapy for acute pericarditis.

Options D and E are incorrect because pericardiocentesis (draining fluid from the pericardial space) and pericardiectomy (surgical removal of the pericardium) are typically reserved for cases of pericardial tamponade or constrictive pericarditis, which are not present in this patient.

The American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend NSAIDs, such as indomethacin, as the initial treatment for acute pericarditis.",Success
"A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for evaluation of altered mental status. He was found on the floor in front of his apartment. He is somnolent but responsive when aroused. His pulse is 64/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, and blood pressure is 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, an alcoholic smell and slurred speech are noted. Neurological exam shows diminished deep tendon reflexes bilaterally and an ataxic gait. His pupils are normal. Blood alcohol concentration is 0.04%. An ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is A. Hypoglycemia.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as altered mental status, somnolence, slurred speech, and ataxic gait, are consistent with hypoglycemia.
* The patient's blood alcohol concentration is 0.04%, which is below the legal limit for intoxication and unlikely to cause the observed symptoms.
* There is no evidence of cerebral ischemia (option B) based on the patient's physical examination and ECG results.
* Cannabis intoxication (option D) typically presents with conjunctival injection, increased heart rate, and orthostatic hypotension, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.
* Benzodiazepine intoxication (option E) can cause altered mental status, but it is less likely given the patient's normal pupils and lack of other characteristic symptoms.

Hypoglycemia is a common cause of altered mental status, especially in patients with a history of alcohol use. The patient's symptoms, combined with the low blood alcohol concentration, suggest that hypoglycemia is the most likely cause of his symptoms.

It's worth noting that the patient's diminished deep tendon reflexes bilaterally are also consistent with hypoglycemia, as hypoglycemia can cause a decrease in reflexes.",Success
"A 77-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with the complaints of fever, malaise, and night sweats. She recently observed an enlargement of her axillary lymph nodes, which she examines on a weekly basis. She has a remote history of breast cancer in her 60s that was treated with radiation and chemotherapy. She also reports a history of extensive travel to Africa and a 30-pack-year history of smoking. On physical exam, several axillary lymph nodes are palpable with a large non-tender palpable mass in her right axilla measuring 10 x 8 cm. Fine-needle aspiration demonstrates what the pathologist describes as ""a centroblastic and immunoblastic cell presence, suspicious for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)–diffuse large B cell variant"". Which of the following risk factors is responsible for this patient’s condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Previous radiation therapy.

The patient's symptoms and fine-needle aspiration results suggest a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The risk factor responsible for this patient's condition is the previous radiation therapy she received for breast cancer.

Ionizing radiation is a well-established risk factor for the development of NHL, including DLBCL. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified ionizing radiation as ""carcinogenic to humans,"" and numerous studies have shown a significant increase in the risk of NHL following radiation exposure.

While the patient's travel to Africa (Option A) may have exposed her to various infectious agents, there is no direct link between travel to Africa and the development of DLBCL. Axillary lymph node involvement (Option B) is a common presentation of NHL, but it is not a risk factor for developing the disease. Female gender (Option D) is not a significant risk factor for DLBCL, as the incidence of NHL is similar between men and women. Previous breast cancer (Option E) is not a direct risk factor for DLBCL, but the radiation therapy received for breast cancer treatment is a contributing factor.

It's essential to note that the patient's 30-pack-year history of smoking is not a significant risk factor for DLBCL. While smoking is a risk factor for many cancers, it is not strongly associated with NHL.",Success
"A 3-month-old infant is brought to her pediatrician because she coughs and seems to have difficulty breathing while feeding. In addition, she seems to have less energy compared to other babies and appears listless throughout the day. She was born by cesarean section to a G1P1 woman with no prior medical history and had a normal APGAR score at birth. Her parents say that she has never been observed to turn blue. Physical exam reveals a high-pitched holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following abnormalities?",A,"The correct answer is A. 22q11 deletion.

The patient's symptoms, including coughing, difficulty breathing while feeding, listlessness, and a high-pitched holosystolic murmur, are consistent with a congenital heart defect. The murmur's location at the lower left sternal border suggests a ventricular septal defect (VSD).

VSD is a common congenital heart defect associated with 22q11 deletion syndrome, also known as DiGeorge syndrome. This syndrome is caused by a deletion of a segment of chromosome 22q11 and can result in a range of congenital anomalies, including heart defects, particularly VSD.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings:

B. Deletion of genes on chromosome 7 is associated with cystic fibrosis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

C. Lithium exposure in utero is associated with Ebstein's anomaly, a rare congenital heart defect that affects the tricuspid valve.

D. Maternal alcohol consumption is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, which can cause a range of birth defects, but not typically VSD.

E. Retinoic acid exposure in utero is associated with craniofacial and limb abnormalities, but not typically congenital heart defects.

The patient has asthma that is treated with an albuterol inhaler. Her mother has a lung disease treated with methotrexate. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 10 years. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Physical examination shows slight wheezes throughout both lung fields. Laboratory studies and urinalysis are positive for polysaccharide antigen. Bronchoalveolar lavage using silver/PAS-staining shows macrophages filled with a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is E. Blastomyces dermatitidis infection.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, including dry cough, chest discomfort, headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, fever, and chills, are consistent with a fungal infection.
* The patient's history of hiking in Mississippi suggests exposure to a fungal pathogen, as Mississippi is an endemic area for Blastomyces dermatitidis.
* The laboratory studies and urinalysis positive for polysaccharide antigen support the diagnosis of a fungal infection.
* The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) findings of macrophages filled with a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae are characteristic of Blastomyces dermatitidis.

Blastomyces dermatitidis is a dimorphic fungus that can cause blastomycosis, a disease that typically affects the lungs but can also involve the skin, bones, and other organs. The fungus is commonly found in soil and decaying organic matter in the Midwestern and Southeastern United States, including Mississippi.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

* A. Legionella pneumophila infection typically presents with a more severe pneumonia, and the BAL findings would not show a dimorphic fungus.
* B. Aspergillus fumigatus infection is more common in immunocompromised patients, and the BAL findings would show branching, septate hyphae, not dimorphic fungi.
* C. Pneumocystis pneumonia typically affects immunocompromised patients, and the BAL findings would show cysts or trophozoites, not dimorphic fungi.
* D. Histoplasma capsulatum infection can present with similar symptoms, but the BAL findings would show oval, budding yeast, not dimorphic fungi with septate hyphae.

What is the most likely causal microorganism?",E,"The correct answer is B. Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as fever, purulent cough, and basal crackles on the right side of the chest, are consistent with pneumonia.
* The chest radiography showing a new consolidation on the right side further supports this diagnosis.
* The complete blood count (CBC) results are also consistent with pneumonia, as the patient has a normal leukocyte count with a slight increase in neutrophils, which is a common response to bacterial infections.
* Among the options, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most likely causal microorganism for several reasons:
	+ It is a common cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia, especially in patients who have been hospitalized for a week or more.
	+ It is a frequent cause of pneumonia in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as stroke.
	+ The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with pneumococcal pneumonia.
	+ The other options are less likely based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results:
		- Pseudomonas aeruginosa is more commonly associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia and would typically cause a more severe illness.
		- Mycobacterium tuberculosis is unlikely given the patient's acute presentation and lack of chronic symptoms.
		- Haemophilus influenzae is a possible cause of community-acquired pneumonia, but it is less common in hospitalized patients.
		- Staphylococcus aureus can cause pneumonia, but it is more commonly associated with healthcare-associated infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or surgical wound infections.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia, and it should be considered in patients with risk factors such as underlying medical conditions and prolonged hospitalization.",Success
"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother for worsening wheezing and shortness of breath over the past day. He has not had a fever, cough, vomiting, or diarrhea.

His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 100/80. Expiratory and inspiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. There are moderate intercostal and subcostal retractions and a decreased inspiratory to expiratory ratio. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium treatments and intravenous methylprednisolone are given in the emergency department for a presumed asthma exacerbation. One hour later, the child is limp and lethargic. Magnesium sulfate is administered. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 150/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/70. No wheezing is heard on repeat pulmonary examination. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. Intubate with mechanical ventilation.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a severe asthma exacerbation. The administration of nebulized albuterol and ipratropium, as well as intravenous methylprednisolone, is appropriate initial management. However, the patient's subsequent deterioration, characterized by lethargy and a decreased respiratory rate, suggests respiratory failure.

The administration of magnesium sulfate is also appropriate, as it can help relax airway smooth muscle and improve bronchodilation. However, the patient's current status requires more aggressive management.

Intubation with mechanical ventilation (Option A) is the most appropriate next step in management. This is because the patient is showing signs of respiratory failure, including lethargy and a decreased respiratory rate, despite initial treatment. Mechanical ventilation will help support the patient's respiratory function and provide a more controlled environment for oxygenation and ventilation.

Option B, needle thoracostomy at the 2nd intercostal space, is not indicated in this scenario, as there is no evidence of a pneumothorax or tension pneumothorax.

Option C, bronchoscopy, is not necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with an asthma exacerbation rather than a foreign body or other obstructive lesion.

Option D, providing a helium and oxygen mixture, may be useful in some cases of asthma exacerbation, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario, given the patient's respiratory failure.

Option E, providing an additional dose of methylprednisolone, may be considered, but it is not the most critical intervention at this point, given the patient's respiratory status.

According to current asthma management guidelines, patients with severe asthma exacerbations who show signs of respiratory failure should be intubated and mechanically ventilated to support their respiratory function.",Success
"A 5-year-old female suffers from recurrent infections by Aspergillus species, Pseudomonas species, and Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's neutrophils are examined in the laboratory and they fail to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test. Which of the following is most likely dysfunctional in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Respiratory burst.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent infections with catalase-positive bacteria and fungi, such as Aspergillus and Pseudomonas species.

The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test is a diagnostic tool used to assess the respiratory burst activity of neutrophils. In a normal NBT test, neutrophils reduce the yellow dye nitroblue tetrazolium to a blue formazan precipitate, indicating the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the respiratory burst. In CGD, neutrophils fail to produce ROS, resulting in a negative NBT test.

The respiratory burst is a critical mechanism by which neutrophils kill ingested microorganisms. It involves the production of ROS, such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, which are toxic to microorganisms. In CGD, the genes encoding the subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex, which is responsible for generating ROS, are mutated, leading to a deficiency in respiratory burst activity.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Lymphocytes are not primarily involved in the defense against Aspergillus and Pseudomonas species infections.

B. Immunoglobulin class switching is a process involved in the adaptive immune response and is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

C. Superoxide dismutase is an enzyme that converts superoxide into hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, but it is not directly involved in the respiratory burst.

D. Myeloperoxidase is an enzyme involved in the production of hypochlorous acid, which is toxic to microorganisms, but it is not the primary mechanism affected in CGD.

On physical examination, the boy is sitting and leaning forward in apparent respiratory distress with suprasternal and intercostal retractions. Auscultation reveals inspiratory stridor without wheezing. He has a frequent barking cough and a hoarse voice when he speaks. What is a chest X-ray likely to show?",E,"The correct answer is E. Steeple sign.

The patient's symptoms, such as a 'cough-like-a-seal bark', high-pitched inspiratory noise, inspiratory stridor, and hoarse voice, are consistent with a diagnosis of croup, a viral infection that causes inflammation of the larynx and trachea. The chest X-ray in a patient with croup is likely to show a steeple sign, which is a narrowing of the tracheal air column on the anteroposterior (AP) view, giving it a steeple-like appearance. This is due to the inflammation and swelling of the tracheal mucosa.

The other options are not consistent with the diagnosis of croup:

A. Diffuse streaky infiltrates are more likely seen in pneumonia or bronchiolitis.

B. Increased interstitial markings can be seen in various conditions, including heart failure, pneumonia, or interstitial lung disease, but are not specific to croup.

C. Lobar consolidation in the lingual is not a typical finding in croup, and the lingual is not a lobe of the lung.

D. The thumbprint sign is typically seen on a lateral neck X-ray in patients with epiglottitis, which is a different condition from croup.

It's worth noting that a chest X-ray is not always necessary to diagnose croup, and the diagnosis is often made clinically based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. However, if a chest X-ray is obtained, the steeple sign can be a supportive finding.",Success
"A 26-year-old woman presents to a gynecologist after a missed period. After performing a complete physical examination and a screening test for pregnancy, her gynecologist informs her that she is pregnant. She is very surprised as she has been taking oral contraceptives regularly. When the gynecologist asks her about the consumption of any other medications, she mentions that she was placed on treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) 2 months ago. Her current anti-TB regimen includes rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin leading to decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone.

Rifampin, an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis, is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. This enzyme is responsible for metabolizing many drugs, including oral contraceptives. When rifampin induces CYP3A4, it increases the metabolism of ethinylestradiol and progesterone, the active components of oral contraceptives. As a result, the serum levels of these hormones decrease, leading to a reduction in their effectiveness as contraceptives.

The other options are not correct:

B. Rifampin induces CYP3A4, not CYP2A6, and increased inactivation of ethinylestradiol is not the primary mechanism of oral contraceptive failure in this scenario.

C. Isoniazid can inhibit CYP2E1, but this would not lead to decreased serum levels of progesterone.

D. Pyrazinamide does not interfere with the intestinal absorption of oral contraceptives.

E. Ethambutol does not increase renal elimination of the progesterone component of oral contraceptives.

It's essential to note that rifampin is a well-known inducer of CYP3A4, and its co-administration with oral contraceptives can lead to decreased efficacy. Therefore, alternative methods of contraception should be considered in patients taking rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers.",Success

On abdominal exam you note diffuse tenderness to palpation without rebound or guarding. There are no masses, hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds are hyperactive. Ultrasound of the right lower quadrant is negative for appendicitis. Stool is guaiac positive. He receives 15mg/kg acetaminophen and fluids are started. The next day, he complains of lower extremity weakness and tingling. On repeat exam, lower extremity strength is 3/5 with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following lab findings would most likely be seen in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). The patient's history of bloody stools, decreased oral intake, and signs of dehydration (dry mucous membranes, hyperactive bowel sounds) are consistent with HUS. The development of neurological symptoms, such as lower extremity weakness and tingling, is also a common feature of HUS.

The lab finding that would most likely be seen in this patient is an increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein with a normal cell count. This is because HUS can cause a neurological syndrome characterized by demyelination and axonal damage, leading to increased protein levels in the CSF. The normal cell count rules out meningitis or encephalitis.

Option A, Gram stain positive CSF, is not consistent with HUS and would suggest a bacterial meningitis, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings.

Option B, Peripheral eosinophilia, is not typically seen in HUS and would be more consistent with a parasitic infection or allergic reaction.

Option C, Xanthochromia on cerebrospinal fluid analysis, is a finding that suggests subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is not related to HUS.

Option E, Oligoclonal bands on cerebrospinal fluid analysis, is a finding that suggests multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating disorders, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings.

It's worth noting that the diagnosis of HUS is typically made based on clinical findings, laboratory results (such as complete blood count, blood chemistry, and stool tests), and imaging studies. The treatment of HUS is primarily supportive, focusing on fluid and electrolyte management, blood pressure control, and dialysis if necessary.",Success
A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the physician because of an inward turning of his left forefoot. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation by cesarean section because of breech presentation. The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios. Examination shows concavity of the medial border of the left foot with a skin crease just below the ball of the great toe. The lateral border of the left foot is convex. The heel is in neutral position. Tickling the lateral border of the foot leads to correction of the deformity. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the left foot shows an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?,D,"The correct answer is D. Reassurance.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of metatarsus adductus, a common congenital deformity characterized by inward turning of the forefoot. The presence of oligohydramnios during pregnancy and breech presentation are risk factors for this condition.

The key feature that guides management in this case is the ability to correct the deformity by tickling the lateral border of the foot. This suggests that the deformity is flexible and not rigid, which is a crucial distinction.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), metatarsus adductus in newborns can be managed conservatively with observation and reassurance, as most cases will resolve spontaneously by 4-6 months of age.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Foot abduction brace: While bracing may be used in some cases of metatarsus adductus, it is not necessary in this scenario, given the flexibility of the deformity.

B. Osteotomy of the metatarsals: Surgical intervention is not indicated for a flexible deformity in a newborn.

C. Arthrodesis of the forefoot: This is a surgical procedure that involves fusing bones together, which is not necessary for a flexible deformity in a newborn.

E. Tarsometatarsal capsulotomy: This is a surgical procedure that involves releasing the joint capsule, which is not indicated for a flexible deformity in a newborn.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is reassurance, with follow-up appointments to monitor the deformity and ensure it resolves spontaneously.",Success

Abdominal ultrasonography is performed, but the results are inconclusive. Cholescintigraphy shows the intrahepatic bile ducts, hepatic ducts, common bile duct, and proximal small bowel. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?""",E,"The correct answer is E. Obstruction of the cystic duct.

Here's why:

The patient presents with right upper abdominal pain, nausea, and fever, which are common symptoms of cholecystitis. The physical examination reveals a distended abdomen and right upper quadrant tenderness, which further supports this diagnosis. The laboratory studies show a mild elevation in leukocyte count, indicating inflammation, and mild elevations in liver enzymes, which can be seen in cholecystitis.

The key finding that points to the correct diagnosis is the cholescintigraphy result. Cholescintigraphy is a nuclear medicine study that evaluates the bile ducts and gallbladder. In this case, the study shows the intrahepatic bile ducts, hepatic ducts, common bile duct, and proximal small bowel, but not the gallbladder. This suggests that the cystic duct, which connects the gallbladder to the common bile duct, is obstructed, preventing the radiotracer from entering the gallbladder.

Option E, obstruction of the cystic duct, is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. This obstruction can be caused by a gallstone, which is a common cause of cholecystitis, especially in patients with a high BMI like this patient.

The other options are not supported by the clinical presentation and laboratory studies:

A. Autodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory studies, which suggest a biliary rather than pancreatic source of the problem.

B. Hypomotility of the gallbladder can cause symptoms, but it would not explain the obstruction seen on cholescintigraphy.

C. Fistula between the gallbladder and small intestine is a rare complication of cholecystitis, but it would not explain the patient's symptoms and laboratory studies.

D. Infection with a hepatotropic virus would not explain the patient's symptoms and laboratory studies, which suggest a biliary source of the problem.",Success
A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the intensive care unit for shortness of breath and palpitations. A cardiac catheterization is performed and measurements of the left ventricular volume and pressure at different points in the cardiac cycle are obtained. The patient's pressure-volume loop (gray) is shown with a normal pressure-volume loop (black) for comparison. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?,C,"The correct answer is A. Mitral valve regurgitation.

The pressure-volume loop provided shows a characteristic shape, with an increased end-diastolic volume and a decreased end-systolic volume compared to the normal loop. This suggests that the left ventricle is not effectively ejecting blood during systole, resulting in a larger residual volume at the end of systole.

Mitral valve regurgitation is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms because it would lead to a volume overload of the left ventricle, resulting in increased end-diastolic volume and decreased ejection fraction. The regurgitant flow through the mitral valve would also cause a decrease in forward cardiac output, leading to shortness of breath and palpitations.

Here's why the other options are not the most likely cause:

B. Increased systemic vascular resistance would shift the pressure-volume loop upward and to the left, indicating increased pressure and decreased volume. This is not consistent with the provided loop.

C. Increased ventricular wall stiffness would result in a steeper slope of the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship, but it would not explain the increased end-diastolic volume and decreased ejection fraction.

D. Impaired left ventricular contractility would result in a downward shift of the pressure-volume loop, indicating decreased pressure and volume. This is not consistent with the provided loop.

E. Aortic stenosis would result in a pressure overload of the left ventricle, leading to increased pressure and decreased volume. This is not consistent with the provided loop.

It's worth noting that the diagnosis of mitral valve regurgitation would require additional evaluation, such as echocardiography, to confirm the diagnosis.",Success
"A 22-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, intermittent rigors, and night sweats. She also has a 1-month history of progressive fatigue. Five weeks ago, she was hospitalized and received intravenous antibiotics for treatment of bacterial meningitis while visiting relatives in Guatemala. Her temperature is 39.4°C (102.9°F), pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 105/70 mm Hg. Examination shows pallor and scattered petechiae and ecchymoses. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.0 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 1,100/mm3 with 30% segmented neutrophils, and a platelet count of 20,000/mm3 . Blood cultures grow coagulase-negative staphylococci. The patient was most likely treated with which of the following antibiotics?",E,"The correct answer is E. Chloramphenicol.

Here's the justification:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of pancytopenia, which is a rare but known complication of chloramphenicol therapy. Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic that was commonly used to treat bacterial meningitis, especially in Central America. The patient's history of receiving intravenous antibiotics for bacterial meningitis in Guatemala five weeks ago suggests that she was likely treated with chloramphenicol.

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, rigors, and night sweats, are consistent with a severe infection, which is supported by the growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci in blood cultures. However, the patient's pancytopenia, characterized by low hemoglobin, leukocyte, and platelet counts, is a distinctive feature of chloramphenicol toxicity.

The other options are less likely:

A. Doxycycline is not typically associated with pancytopenia.

B. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is not commonly used to treat bacterial meningitis.

C. Vancomycin is not typically associated with pancytopenia, and its use would not explain the patient's history of receiving antibiotics in Guatemala.

D. Linezolid is not typically used to treat bacterial meningitis, and its use would not explain the patient's history of receiving antibiotics in Guatemala.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and medical history, the most likely antibiotic that the patient was treated with is chloramphenicol.",Success
"An otherwise healthy 50-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss during this time. Physical examination shows bilateral pitting pedal edema. An endoscopy shows prominent rugae in the gastric fundus. Biopsy shows parietal cell atrophy. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause?",B,"The correct answer is E. Ectopic secretion of gastrin.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss, are consistent with a diagnosis of gastritis or gastric hypersecretion. The endoscopic finding of prominent rugae in the gastric fundus suggests gastritis or gastric hyperplasia. The biopsy result showing parietal cell atrophy is also consistent with this diagnosis.

The most likely underlying cause of these symptoms is a gastrinoma, a type of neuroendocrine tumor that secretes excessive amounts of gastrin, leading to gastric hypersecretion and hyperplasia. This is option E, ectopic secretion of gastrin.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and endoscopic findings:

A. Serotonin-secreting gastric tumor: While serotonin-secreting tumors can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, they are typically associated with carcinoid syndrome, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

B. Proliferation of gastric mucus-producing cells: This would not explain the patient's symptoms or the endoscopic findings.

C. Neoplasia of submucosal lymphoid tissue: This could refer to a lymphoma, but the symptoms and endoscopic findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

D. Excessive somatostatin secretion: Somatostatin is a hormone that inhibits gastrin secretion, so excessive somatostatin secretion would not cause gastric hypersecretion and hyperplasia.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), support the diagnosis of gastrinoma as a cause of gastric hypersecretion and hyperplasia.",Success

Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 19 mEq/L
Glucose: 90 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is E. Supportive therapy and close monitoring.

Here's why:

The patient's initial presentation suggests severe hyperkalemia (K+ 6.3 mEq/L) and hyperglycemia (glucose 589 mg/dL), which are likely related to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension also support this diagnosis.

After treatment, the patient's potassium level has decreased to 4.3 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. The glucose level has also decreased to 90 mg/dL, indicating that the patient's DKA is resolving.

At this point, the best next step in management is supportive therapy and close monitoring (Option E). The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of recurrent DKA, electrolyte imbalances, or other complications. Supportive therapy may include oxygen therapy, cardiac monitoring, and management of any underlying infections.

Options A, B, and C are not correct because the patient's potassium level is now within the normal range, and insulin therapy is not necessary at this time. IV fluids may be continued to help with hydration, but they are not the primary focus of management at this stage.

Option D, oral rehydration, is not appropriate because the patient's condition is still unstable, and oral hydration may not be sufficient to manage any potential complications.

It's essential to note that the patient's methadone use and IV drug abuse history may require additional management and monitoring, but this is not the primary focus of management at this stage.",Success
"A 67-year-old man who was diagnosed with arthritis 16 years ago presents with right knee swelling and pain. His left knee was swollen a few weeks ago, but now with both joints affected, he has difficulty walking and feels frustrated. He also has back pain which makes it extremely difficult to move around and be active during the day. He says his pain significantly improves with rest. He also suffers from dandruff for which he uses special shampoos. Physical examination is notable for pitting of his nails. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Psoriatic arthritis.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as knee swelling and pain, are consistent with inflammatory arthritis.
* The patient's history of dandruff and use of special shampoos suggests a diagnosis of psoriasis, which is a common comorbidity with psoriatic arthritis.
* The physical examination finding of pitting of the nails is a characteristic feature of psoriatic arthritis.
* The patient's symptoms improve with rest, which is also consistent with psoriatic arthritis.
* While rheumatoid arthritis (option C) can also cause knee swelling and pain, the presence of pitting nails and the patient's history of psoriasis make psoriatic arthritis a more likely diagnosis.
* Arthritis mutilans (option B) is a rare and severe form of psoriatic arthritis, but it typically presents with more extensive joint damage and deformity than what is described in this patient.
* Familial Mediterranean fever (option D) is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes recurrent episodes of fever, arthritis, and serositis, but it is not typically associated with psoriasis or nail pitting.
* Mixed connective tissue disease (option E) is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause arthritis, but it is not typically associated with psoriasis or nail pitting.

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) have established criteria for the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis, which include the presence of inflammatory joint disease, psoriasis, and other characteristic features such as nail pitting.",Success
A 65-year-old woman schedules an appointment with her physician for evaluation of weight loss and weakness. The weakness is more noticeable when climbing stairs and combing hair. The weakness improves after brief exercise. She also has bladder incontinence for the past 4 weeks and was given an anticholinesterase agent with no improvement. What is the most likely cause of the symptoms?,E,"The correct answer is D. Myasthenia gravis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as weakness that improves after brief exercise, are classic features of myasthenia gravis (MG). MG is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. The weakness is typically worse with repetitive movements and improves with rest.

The specific symptoms mentioned, such as difficulty climbing stairs and combing hair, suggest proximal muscle weakness, which is common in MG. The bladder incontinence is also consistent with MG, as it can affect the autonomic nervous system.

The fact that the patient did not respond to an anticholinesterase agent, which is a medication used to treat urinary incontinence, further supports the diagnosis of MG. Anticholinesterase agents are also used to treat MG, but they would have improved the patient's symptoms if MG were the correct diagnosis.

Botulism (A) is unlikely, as it typically presents with descending paralysis, starting with cranial nerves and progressing to the limbs. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (B) is a genetic disorder that typically presents in childhood, and the patient's age and symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis. Hypothyroidism (C) can cause muscle weakness, but it would not typically present with the specific symptoms mentioned, and the patient's response to exercise would not be characteristic of hypothyroidism. Paraneoplastic syndrome from small cell carcinoma of the lung (E) is a rare condition that can cause muscle weakness, but it would typically present with other symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, and neurological symptoms, and would not be the most likely cause of the patient's specific symptoms.

In summary, the patient's symptoms, particularly the weakness that improves with brief exercise, are most consistent with myasthenia gravis.",Success
"A 3-month-old boy presents to his pediatrician with persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, and signs and symptoms suggestive of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia. His weight is in the 10th percentile. He is being evaluated for an immunodeficiency disease. Laboratory results for the HIV are negative by PCR. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Defective T cell function.

The patient's symptoms, such as persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, and RSV pneumonia, suggest a defect in cell-mediated immunity, which is primarily mediated by T cells. The presence of oral candidiasis, in particular, is a hallmark of T cell dysfunction.

The patient's negative HIV PCR result rules out HIV infection as the cause of the immunodeficiency.

Option B, grossly reduced levels of B cells, would suggest a B cell deficiency, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. While B cells play a crucial role in humoral immunity, they are not primarily responsible for defending against fungal infections like candidiasis or viral infections like RSV.

Option C, an X-linked inheritance of HLA genes, is not directly related to the patient's symptoms. HLA genes are involved in the immune response, but an X-linked inheritance pattern would not specifically explain the patient's T cell dysfunction.

Option D, defective isotype switching, refers to a defect in the ability of B cells to switch from producing one class of immunoglobulin (e.g., IgM) to another (e.g., IgG). While this can lead to immunodeficiency, it is not the primary cause of the patient's symptoms, which are more consistent with T cell dysfunction.

Option E, selective IgA deficiency, is a relatively common immunodeficiency disorder, but it is not typically associated with the patient's symptoms, particularly oral candidiasis and RSV pneumonia.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, defective T cell function (Option A) is the most likely cause of the immunodeficiency disease.",Success
"A 53-year-old man with recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma is enrolled in a clinical trial for a novel chemotherapeutic agent that his physician believes may be beneficial to his condition. The novel drug was previously tested in a small population and is now undergoing a larger phase 3 trial in preparation for FDA approval. A dose-response trial had the following results:

10 mg dose - 6/59 patients demonstrated improvement
20 mg dose - 19/49 patients demonstrated improvement
30 mg dose - 26/53 patients demonstrated improvement
40 mg dose - 46/51 patients demonstrated improvement

The same trial also had the following safety profile:

20 mg dose - 5/49 patients had a treatment related adverse event
40 mg dose - 11/51 patients had a treatment related adverse event
60 mg dose - 15/42 patients had a treatment related adverse event
80 mg dose - 23/47 patients had a treatment related adverse event
100 mg dose - 47/52 patients had a treatment related adverse event

Based on this study, which of the following represents the most likely therapeutic index for this novel chemotherapeutic agent?",E,"To determine the therapeutic index, we need to identify the dose that produces the maximum therapeutic effect (i.e., the highest response rate) and the dose that produces an unacceptable level of adverse events.

From the dose-response trial results, we can see that the maximum therapeutic effect is achieved at the 40 mg dose, with 46/51 patients (90.2%) demonstrating improvement.

From the safety profile, we can see that the dose with an unacceptable level of adverse events is the 100 mg dose, with 47/52 patients (90.4%) experiencing treatment-related adverse events.

To calculate the therapeutic index, we can use the following formula:

Therapeutic Index (TI) = LD50 (or dose with unacceptable toxicity) / ED50 (or dose with maximum therapeutic effect)

In this case, the LD50 (dose with unacceptable toxicity) is approximately 100 mg, and the ED50 (dose with maximum therapeutic effect) is 40 mg.

TI = 100 mg / 40 mg = 2.5

"A 67-year-old male is seen by neurology after he was noticed to be speaking strangely by his family. After acute treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the patient is able to recover most of his speech. Subsequent neurologic exam finds that the patient is fluent while speaking and is able to comprehend both one and two step instructions. Noticeably the patient remains unable to complete tasks involving verbal repetition. Residual damage to which of the following structures is most likely responsible for this patient's syndrome?",A,"The correct answer is A. Arcuate fasciculus.

The patient's symptoms, specifically the inability to repeat verbal instructions despite being fluent and able to comprehend one and two-step instructions, are consistent with conduction aphasia. Conduction aphasia is a type of aphasia that results from damage to the arcuate fasciculus, a bundle of fibers that connects the Wernicke's area (responsible for language comprehension) and Broca's area (responsible for language production).

The arcuate fasciculus is responsible for the repetition of verbal information, and damage to this structure disrupts the ability to repeat words and phrases. The patient's ability to comprehend instructions and speak fluently suggests that Wernicke's area and Broca's area are intact, but the damage to the arcuate fasciculus is preventing the repetition of verbal information.

The other options are not correct because:

* B. Inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) is responsible for language production, and damage to this area would result in expressive aphasia, characterized by difficulty speaking in grammatically correct sentences.
* C. Superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) is responsible for language comprehension, and damage to this area would result in receptive aphasia, characterized by difficulty understanding spoken language.
* D. Inferior frontal gyrus + superior temporal gyrus would result in a combination of expressive and receptive aphasia, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.
* E. Arcuate fasciculus + inferior frontal gyrus + superior temporal gyrus would result in a combination of conduction aphasia, expressive aphasia, and receptive aphasia, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

It's worth noting that the patient's initial symptoms, including difficulty speaking, were likely due to the acute ischemic stroke, and the administration of tPA helped to restore some of the language function. However, the residual damage to the arcuate fasciculus is responsible for the patient's persistent difficulty with verbal repetition.",Success
"A 27-year-old woman presents to the office with concerns about her long struggle with her physical appearance since adolescence. She says she has always been ""large"" and was constantly targeted by her classmates and coworkers for being so.

She has tried numerous diet plans, exercise regimens, and cosmetic products with little to no effect. Recently, she underwent a glucose tolerance test that showed a plasma glucose level of 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L) after 2 hours of a 75 g dose of oral glucose. She has a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a menstrual cycle that occurs every 45 days. Her pulse is 72/min and the blood pressure is 138/80 mm Hg. On physical examination, her height is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) and her weight is 85 kg (187 lb), and she has severe inflammatory acne over the cheeks and forehead and dark coarse hairs on the back. What is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with PCOS, a hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age. The key features of PCOS include:

1. **Hirsutism**: The patient has unwanted facial hair on her upper lip, which is a common symptom of PCOS.
2. **Acne**: The patient has severe inflammatory acne on her cheeks and forehead, which is another common feature of PCOS.
3. **Irregular menstrual cycle**: The patient's menstrual cycle occurs every 45 days, which is indicative of ovulatory dysfunction, a hallmark of PCOS.
4. **Family history of type 2 diabetes**: The patient's family history of type 2 diabetes increases her risk of developing insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, which are common comorbidities with PCOS.
5. **Impaired glucose tolerance**: The patient's plasma glucose level of 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L) after 2 hours of a 75 g dose of oral glucose indicates impaired glucose tolerance, which is often seen in PCOS.

While the other options are plausible, they do not fit the patient's presentation as well as PCOS:

A. **Hypothyroidism**: The patient's symptoms do not suggest hypothyroidism, which typically presents with fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, and cold intolerance.

B. **Idiopathic hirsutism**: This diagnosis is unlikely, as the patient has multiple symptoms beyond hirsutism, including acne, irregular menstrual cycle, and impaired glucose tolerance.

C. **Cushing's disease**: The patient's symptoms do not suggest Cushing's disease, which typically presents with weight gain, moon facies, buffalo hump, and purple striae.

E. **Ovarian hyperthecosis**: This is a rare condition characterized by androgen-secreting ovarian tumors, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

In conclusion, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS).",Success

Which of the following is the best measure to prevent the progression of the symptoms present in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Strict blood glucose control.

The patient's symptoms of tingling, numbness, and persistent pain in the lower limbs are consistent with diabetic neuropathy, a common complication of uncontrolled diabetes. The patient's past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, inconsistently managed with metformin and glimepiride, suggests that poor glycemic control may be contributing to the development of diabetic neuropathy.

The patient's blood sugar analyses show elevated fasting and post-prandial glucose levels, as well as an elevated HbA1c level of 8.1%, indicating poor glycemic control. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends an HbA1c target of <7% for most patients with diabetes.

Strict blood glucose control is the best measure to prevent the progression of diabetic neuropathy symptoms. Tight glycemic control has been shown to slow the progression of diabetic neuropathy and improve symptoms. The ADA recommends that patients with diabetes aim to achieve a blood glucose level of <140 mg/dL before meals and <180 mg/dL after meals.

The other options are not directly related to preventing the progression of diabetic neuropathy symptoms:

A. Atorvastatin is a statin medication used to treat high cholesterol, which is not directly related to diabetic neuropathy.

B. Femoro-ileal artery bypass is a surgical procedure used to treat peripheral artery disease, which is not indicated in this patient based on the provided information.

D. Strict control of blood pressure is important for patients with diabetes, but it is not the primary measure to prevent the progression of diabetic neuropathy symptoms.

E. Lower limb amputation is a drastic measure that is not indicated in this patient, as the symptoms are not severe enough to warrant such a procedure.

In summary, strict blood glucose control is the best measure to prevent the progression of diabetic neuropathy symptoms in this patient.",Success
"A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient’s two older siblings are both healthy. The patient’s temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 58/37 mmHg, pulse is 166/min, and respirations are 38/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress. His abdomen is firm and distended with hypoactive bowel sounds.

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this fetus’s presentation?",A,"The correct answer is A. Duodenal atresia.

Here's why:

* The patient's presentation with bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and hypoactive bowel sounds suggests an obstruction in the proximal small intestine.
* The fact that the patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium suggests that the obstruction is likely above the level of the ampulla of Vater, which is the point where the bile duct and pancreatic duct empty into the small intestine.
* The patient's prenatal history is also consistent with duodenal atresia. The quadruple screen results showing decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and increased beta-hCG are suggestive of a neural tube defect or a gastrointestinal anomaly. The decreased unconjugated estriol and increased inhibin A are non-specific markers that can be associated with various fetal anomalies.
* The amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm is slightly elevated, which can be seen in cases of duodenal atresia due to the obstruction causing polyhydramnios.
* Duodenal atresia is a congenital anomaly that occurs in approximately 1 in 10,000 births and is more common in infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes.

Intestinal malrotation (option B) can also present with bilious vomiting, but it is less likely in this scenario given the patient's prenatal history and the fact that they have not yet passed meconium.

Meconium ileus (option C) is a complication of cystic fibrosis and typically presents with abdominal distension and failure to pass meconium, but it is less likely in this scenario given the patient's prenatal history and the presence of bilious vomiting.

Necrotizing enterocolitis (option D) is a condition that typically affects premature infants and is characterized by inflammation and necrosis of the intestinal wall. It is less likely in this scenario given the patient's term gestation and the presence of bilious vomiting.

Pyloric stenosis (option E) typically presents with non-bilious vomiting and is less likely in this scenario given the patient's presentation with bilious vomiting and abdominal distension.",Success
"A healthy 23-year-old male is undergoing an exercise stress test as part of his physiology class. If blood were to be sampled at different locations before and after the stress test, which area of the body would contain the lowest oxygen content at both time points?",C,"The correct answer is C. Coronary sinus.

Here's why:

The coronary sinus is a vein that drains the myocardium (heart muscle) and returns deoxygenated blood to the right atrium. Since it carries blood that has already perfused the heart tissue, it will have the lowest oxygen content compared to other locations.

Before the exercise stress test, the coronary sinus will have a lower oxygen content due to the heart's constant demand for oxygen to function.

During the exercise stress test, the heart rate and cardiac output increase to meet the increased oxygen demands of the exercising muscles. As a result, the coronary sinus will still have a lower oxygen content compared to other locations, as it continues to drain deoxygenated blood from the myocardium.

In contrast:

* The superior and inferior vena cavae (options A and B) carry deoxygenated blood from the upper and lower body, respectively, but this blood has not yet perfused the heart tissue, so it will have a higher oxygen content than the coronary sinus.
* The pulmonary artery (option D) carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs, where it will pick up oxygen. Although it has a lower oxygen content than the pulmonary vein, it is still higher than the coronary sinus.
* The pulmonary vein (option E) carries oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the heart, so it will have the highest oxygen content among the options.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Coronary sinus.",Success

Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Globular 10-week sized uterus.

The patient's symptoms, including increasingly heavy periods, irregular cycles, intermenstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and a ""heavy feeling"" in her pelvis, are consistent with uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors in women of reproductive age, and they are more common in obese women.

A globular 10-week sized uterus is a common physical exam finding in women with uterine fibroids. The uterus may be enlarged and irregularly shaped due to the presence of fibroids, which can cause it to feel larger than normal.

Option A, rectouterine septum nodularity, is more consistent with endometriosis, which is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms.

Option C, adnexal mass, could be related to ovarian pathology, but it is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms.

Option D, irregular 14-week sized uterus, is possible, but the patient's symptoms suggest a smaller uterus, and the irregularity could be due to the presence of fibroids.

Option E, no remarkable physical exam finding, is unlikely given the patient's symptoms, which suggest a palpable abnormality in the uterus.

It's worth noting that the diagnosis of uterine fibroids is typically made through imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI, rather than physical exam alone. However, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, a globular 10-week sized uterus is the most likely physical exam finding.",Success

Labs return with the following values: Na 140, K 4, Cl 106, BUN 8, Cr 2. His ABG has pH 7.3, PaCO2 13mm, PaO2 130mm, HCO3 7. His urinalysis is shown in Figure 1. Blood salicylate levels return as normal. While you await other diagnostic tests, which of the following should be administered next to treat this patient?",E,"The correct answer is A. Ethanol.

The patient's presentation, including erratic behavior, confusion, slurred speech, and ataxia, suggests a diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy, a neurological disorder caused by thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency. This is further supported by the patient's history of chronic alcoholism and homelessness.

The laboratory results, including a normal anion gap and a low bicarbonate level, are consistent with a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is often seen in Wernicke's encephalopathy.

The urinalysis result shown in Figure 1 is likely to show a high specific gravity, indicating dehydration, which is common in patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy.

Thiamine deficiency can cause Wernicke's encephalopathy, and ethanol administration can help to replenish thiamine stores. Therefore, administering ethanol (option A) is the next step in treating this patient.

The other options are not correct because:

* Naltrexone (option B) is an opioid antagonist used to treat opioid dependence, which is not relevant to this patient's presentation.
* Naloxone (option C) is also an opioid antagonist, but it is used to reverse opioid overdose, which is not suspected in this patient.
* Flumazenil (option D) is a benzodiazepine antagonist, which is used to reverse benzodiazepine overdose, but there is no evidence of benzodiazepine use in this patient.
* Fomepizole (option E) is an antidote for methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning, which is not suspected in this patient based on the laboratory results and clinical presentation.

It's important to note that thiamine administration should also be considered in this patient, as it is the primary treatment for Wernicke's encephalopathy. However, based on the options provided, ethanol administration is the next step in treating this patient.",Success
"A medical research study is evaluating an investigational novel drug (medication 1) compared with standard therapy (medication 2) in patients presenting to the emergency department with myocardial infarction (MI).

Endpoints Medication 1 Medication 2 P-Value
Primary: death from cardiac causes 134 210 0.03
Secondary: hyperkalemia 57 70 0.4
What is the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes? (Round to the nearest whole number.)",C,"To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), we need to determine the absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the two groups.

First, let's calculate the event rates for the primary endpoint (death from cardiac causes) in each group:

Medication 1 (novel drug): 134 events / 1,500 patients = 0.089 (or 8.9%)
Medication 2 (standard therapy): 210 events / 1,500 patients = 0.14 (or 14%)

Next, calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR):

ARR = Control event rate - Experimental event rate
= 0.14 - 0.089
= 0.051 (or 5.1%)

Now, calculate the number needed to treat (NNT):

NNT = 1 / ARR
= 1 / 0.051

"A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level during exercises. He reports that he started exercising regularly 2 months ago and that his right calf cramps when he uses the incline feature on the treadmill, forcing him to take frequent breaks. The pain completely disappears after resting for a few minutes. He has an 8-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 34 years. His only medication is metformin. His pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 170/92 mm Hg. Straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot. There is no pain in the back. His muscle strength is normal. Femoral pulses are palpable; right pedal pulses are absent. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Femoropopliteal artery stenosis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms are consistent with intermittent claudication, which is a hallmark of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The key features that support this diagnosis are:

1. **Exercise-induced pain**: The patient experiences tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level during exercises, which is relieved by rest. This is a classic symptom of intermittent claudication.
2. **Calf cramping**: The patient's right calf cramps when he uses the incline feature on the treadmill, which is also consistent with PAD.
3. **Pallor and tingling pain on straight leg raise test**: This test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot, suggesting that the blood flow to the foot is compromised.
4. **Absent pedal pulses**: The absence of right pedal pulses indicates that there is a blockage or stenosis in the arterial circulation to the foot.

Given the patient's history of smoking and diabetes, he is at high risk for developing PAD. The most likely diagnosis is femoropopliteal artery stenosis, which is a common location for PAD.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

B. Vasculitis of the right popliteal artery: While vasculitis can cause similar symptoms, it is less likely in this case due to the patient's risk factors and the lack of other systemic symptoms.

C. Acute thrombosis of right popliteal vein: This would typically present with sudden onset of pain, swelling, and warmth in the affected leg, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

D. Lumbar spinal stenosis: This would typically cause back pain, which is not present in this patient. Additionally, the straight leg raise test would not typically elicit pallor and tingling pain in the foot.

E. Aortoiliac artery stenosis: While this could cause similar symptoms, it would typically affect both legs, and the patient's symptoms are unilateral.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are most consistent with femoropopliteal artery stenosis, making it the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 29-year-old primigravid woman at 35 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in labor. She has no history of serious medical illness. She has had an uncomplicated pregnancy. Her last ultrasound at 22 weeks' gestation was normal. On admission, fetal heartbeats cannot be detected by fetal doppler monitor. Ultrasound shows decreased amniotic fluid levels and no evidence of fetal movement, respiration, or heart activity. The patient gives birth to a 2296 g (5 lb 1 oz) male infant. Physical examination shows no signs of life. There are no visible malformations. The placenta is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Recommend autopsy of the infant.

The scenario describes a stillbirth, which is a fetal death that occurs after 20 weeks of gestation. In this case, the ultrasound shows no evidence of fetal movement, respiration, or heart activity, and the infant is born without signs of life.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that an autopsy be performed after a stillbirth to determine the cause of death and identify any potential genetic or structural abnormalities. An autopsy can provide valuable information to the parents and healthcare providers, which can help in counseling and management of future pregnancies.

While karyotyping of amniotic fluid (Option A) may be useful in identifying chromosomal abnormalities, it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. The ultrasound has already shown no evidence of malformations, and karyotyping may not provide additional information that would change management.

Obtaining photographs, x-ray imaging, and MRI (Option C) may be useful for documentation and potential future evaluation, but it is not the most critical step in management.

Maternal antibody and thrombophilia testing (Option D) may be relevant in certain cases of stillbirth, but it is not the most immediate priority in this scenario.

Parental genetic testing (Option E) may be considered in certain cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to recommend an autopsy of the infant (Option B) to determine the cause of death and provide valuable information to the parents and healthcare providers.",Success
"A 67-year-old man is hospitalized after several days of fever and increasing shortness of breath. Respiratory viral panel returns positive for influenza A and the patient is started on a standard five day course of oseltamivir. Despite therapy, his shortness of breath continues to worsen and his oxygen saturation decreases to the point where ICU transfer and intubation are required. Chest radiograph shows bilateral infiltrates. Clinical criteria are consistent with development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). After several weeks of supportive therapy, the patient improves with lung function returning to near normal. Which of the following processes is involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining after damage to alveoli occurs?",D,"The correct answer is D. Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells.

After alveolar damage, the regeneration of the alveolar lining involves the proliferation of type II pneumocytes, which are surfactant-secreting cells. These cells play a crucial role in the repair process by proliferating and differentiating into type I pneumocytes, which are the primary cells lining the alveoli. Type II pneumocytes produce surfactant, a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that reduces surface tension in the alveoli, facilitating gas exchange and maintaining lung compliance.

The other options are not directly involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining after damage:

A. Squamous cell proliferation is not a typical response to alveolar damage. Squamous cells are more commonly associated with the epithelial lining of the airways, rather than the alveoli.

B. Ciliated cells do play a role in clearing debris and mucus from the airways, but they are not directly involved in the regeneration of the alveolar lining.

C. Excess mucus production by goblet cells is more commonly associated with chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic bronchitis or asthma, rather than the regeneration of alveolar lining after damage.

E. Club cells, also known as Clara cells, are non-ciliated cells found in the bronchioles and are involved in the production of surfactant and other proteins. While they do play a role in maintaining lung homeostasis, they are not the primary cells involved in the regeneration of the alveolar lining after damage.

It's worth noting that the regeneration of alveolar lining is a complex process involving multiple cell types and signaling pathways. However, the proliferation of surfactant-secreting type II pneumocytes is a key step in this process.",Success
A 65-year-old male is treated for anal carcinoma with therapy including external beam radiation. How does radiation affect cancer cells?,E,"The correct answer is E. Induces breaks in double-stranded DNA.

Radiation therapy, including external beam radiation, works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, ultimately leading to their death. Ionizing radiation, such as X-rays or gamma rays, interacts with the DNA molecule, causing breaks in the double-stranded DNA. This damage can occur through direct or indirect mechanisms.

Direct damage occurs when the radiation directly interacts with the DNA molecule, causing breaks in the sugar-phosphate backbone or damage to the nitrogenous bases. Indirect damage occurs when the radiation interacts with water molecules in the cell, producing free radicals that then damage the DNA.

The resulting DNA breaks can lead to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis (programmed cell death), or mutations that inhibit the cancer cell's ability to replicate. This is the primary mechanism by which radiation therapy exerts its anti-tumor effect.

The other options are not directly related to the effects of radiation on cancer cells:

A. Thymidine dimers are a type of DNA lesion that occurs when ultraviolet (UV) radiation, not ionizing radiation, causes the formation of covalent bonds between adjacent thymidine residues.

B. Disulfide bonds are a type of covalent bond that occurs between two cysteine residues in proteins, and are not directly related to radiation's effect on DNA.

C. G/T and A/C pair formation are not a direct result of radiation's effect on DNA.

D. Deamination of cytosine is a process that occurs spontaneously or through enzymatic activity, but it is not a direct result of radiation's effect on DNA.

Therefore, option E, inducing breaks in double-stranded DNA, is the correct answer.",Success
"A 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to his physician with progressive fatigue and new onset muscle cramps. He has had no recent changes to his medication regimen, which includes hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and amlodipine. His temperature is 98.0°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 174/111 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 138 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 3.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 33 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 129 mg/dL

What is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension?",A,"The correct answer is A. Aldosterone excess.

Here's why:

The patient's laboratory values show a low potassium level (3.3 mEq/L), which is a key indicator of aldosterone excess. Aldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that regulates electrolyte balance and blood pressure. Excess aldosterone leads to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the kidneys, resulting in hypokalemia (low potassium levels).

Additionally, the patient's blood pressure is elevated, which is consistent with aldosterone excess. Aldosterone promotes sodium retention, leading to increased blood volume and blood pressure.

The other options can be ruled out based on the patient's laboratory values and physical examination:

B. Catecholamine-secreting mass: This would typically cause tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypertension, but the patient's pulse and respiratory rate are normal.

C. Cortisol excess: This would typically cause hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), but the patient's glucose level is only mildly elevated. Additionally, cortisol excess would not typically cause hypokalemia.

D. Impaired kidney perfusion: This would typically cause azotemia (elevated BUN and creatinine levels), but the patient's BUN level is only mildly elevated, and there is no mention of creatinine level.

E. Increased peripheral vascular resistance: This is a nonspecific term that could contribute to hypertension, but it does not explain the patient's hypokalemia.

In summary, the patient's hypokalemia and hypertension are most consistent with aldosterone excess, making option A the most likely underlying etiology.",Success
A 65-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of yellowish discoloration of his skin and generalized pruritus. Examination shows jaundice of the skin and scleral icterus. Urinalysis shows an elevated concentration of bilirubin and a low concentration of urobilinogen. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?,D,"The correct answer is D. Defective hepatic bile excretion.

Here's why:

The patient presents with jaundice, pruritus, and elevated bilirubin in the urine, which suggests an obstructive pattern of liver disease. The low concentration of urobilinogen in the urine further supports this diagnosis, as urobilinogen is a byproduct of bilirubin metabolism in the gut and is typically increased in hemolytic or hepatic causes of jaundice.

Option D, defective hepatic bile excretion, is the most likely underlying cause of these findings. This could be due to various etiologies such as intrahepatic cholestasis, primary biliary cirrhosis, or extrahepatic biliary obstruction (e.g., gallstones, pancreatic cancer).

Option A, absent UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity, is related to Crigler-Najjar syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects bilirubin metabolism. While it can cause jaundice, it is not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option B, increased hemoglobin breakdown, is related to hemolytic anemia, which would typically present with an elevated urobilinogen level in the urine, not a low level.

Option C, increased intestinal bilirubin reabsorption, is not a direct cause of jaundice and would not explain the patient's symptoms.

Option E, presence of stones within the gallbladder, may be a contributing factor to defective hepatic bile excretion, but it is not the primary underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

According to current medical guidelines, the diagnosis of obstructive jaundice is based on a combination of clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings. In this case, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results point towards a defect in hepatic bile excretion as the most likely underlying cause.",Success
"A 72-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her daughter because of a 6-month history of worsening short-term memory deficits and social withdrawal. Treatment with galantamine is initiated. Two weeks later, the patient develops vomiting, mild crampy abdominal pain, and watery, nonbloody diarrhea. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",D,"The correct answer is A. Bethanechol.

Galantamine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is used to treat Alzheimer's disease and can cause cholinergic side effects, such as vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, due to increased acetylcholine levels. The symptoms described in the question, including vomiting, mild crampy abdominal pain, and watery, nonbloody diarrhea, are consistent with cholinergic overstimulation.

Bethanechol, a cholinergic agonist, can help alleviate these symptoms by stimulating the bowel and increasing gut motility, which can help resolve the gastrointestinal side effects caused by galantamine.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

B. Metoclopramide is an antiemetic that can help with nausea and vomiting, but it is not specifically indicated for cholinergic side effects.

C. Loperamide is an antidiarrheal medication that may worsen the constipation that can occur with galantamine use.

D. Atropine is an anticholinergic medication that would exacerbate the cholinergic side effects caused by galantamine.

E. Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic medication used to treat overactive bladder, which is not related to the symptoms described in the question.

He resides in an inpatient psychiatric facility where he has been successfully treated with haloperidol for the past several months. His physical exam and vitals are within normal limits. Which of the following accurately describes his symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Tardive dyskinesia.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including the smacking motion with his lips, pursing his mouth, and blinking excessively, are classic signs of tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesia is a movement disorder that occurs as a side effect of long-term use of antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol. It is characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements of the face, tongue, lips, and jaw.

The key features that point to tardive dyskinesia in this case are:

* The slow onset of symptoms over 2 weeks
* The presence of orofacial movements (smacking, pursing, and blinking)
* The lack of distress or discomfort reported by the patient
* The patient's history of long-term treatment with haloperidol

In contrast:

* Akathisia (A) is characterized by restlessness, fidgeting, and a feeling of inner tension, which is not described in this patient.
* Acute dystonia (C) is a sudden, severe muscle spasm that can occur shortly after starting antipsychotic medication, but it is not consistent with the slow onset of symptoms in this case.
* Pseudoparkinsonism (D) is a side effect of antipsychotics that mimics Parkinson's disease, characterized by tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, which are not described in this patient.
* Palsy (E) is a general term for paralysis or weakness, which is not relevant to this patient's symptoms.

Physical examination reveals an erythematous, well-demarcated patch with peripheral scale on the left thigh, pubic region, and perineum. There is no apparent scrotal involvement with the rash. How can you confirm the suspected diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. KOH examination of lesion scrapings.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination, the suspected diagnosis is tinea cruris, also known as jock itch. This is a common fungal infection that affects the groin area, causing itching, redness, and scaling.

To confirm the diagnosis, a KOH (potassium hydroxide) examination of lesion scrapings is the most appropriate option. This involves scraping the affected area with a scalpel or a glass slide to collect skin cells and fungal elements. The sample is then mixed with potassium hydroxide, which breaks down the keratin protein in skin cells, allowing the fungal elements to be visualized under a microscope. The presence of fungal hyphae or spores confirms the diagnosis of tinea cruris.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Localized ultrasound is not a diagnostic tool for fungal infections like tinea cruris.

C. Nikolsky's sign is a diagnostic test for blistering skin disorders like pemphigus, not for fungal infections.

D. Gram stain is a diagnostic test for bacterial infections, not fungal infections.

E. AFB (acid-fast bacillus) stain is a diagnostic test for mycobacterial infections like tuberculosis, not for fungal infections.

It's essential to note that a KOH examination is a simple, non-invasive, and cost-effective diagnostic tool that can be performed in a primary care setting, making it an ideal choice for confirming the diagnosis of tinea cruris.",Success
An otherwise healthy 26-year-old man comes to the physician for medication counseling after recently being diagnosed with schizophrenia. Risperidone therapy is initiated. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following adverse effects?,C,"The correct answer is C. Gynecomastia.

Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic that can cause an increase in prolactin levels, leading to hyperprolactinemia. This can result in galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and gynecomastia (breast enlargement) in both men and women.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Agranulocytosis is a rare but serious side effect of clozapine, another atypical antipsychotic, not risperidone.

B. Risperidone can actually prolong the QT interval, not shorten it, which can increase the risk of torsades de pointes and sudden death.

D. Hypothyroidism is not a common side effect of risperidone. While some antipsychotics can cause changes in thyroid function, risperidone is not typically associated with hypothyroidism.

E. Weight loss is not a typical side effect of risperidone. In fact, many antipsychotics, including risperidone, can cause weight gain due to increased appetite and metabolic changes.

It's essential to monitor patients on risperidone for potential side effects, including hyperprolactinemia and its associated symptoms.",Success

Her blood pressure is 95/80 mm Hg and her temperature is 40.0°C (104.0°F). On physical examination, the patient appears diaphoretic. A pelvic examination reveals a tampon in her vagina. Binding and activation of which of the following T cell receptors is responsible for this patient’s most likely condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Variable β-sequence of the T cell receptor.

The patient's symptoms, including fever, altered mental status, petechial rash, nausea, vomiting, and heavy menstrual bleeding, are consistent with a diagnosis of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). The presence of a tampon in her vagina suggests that the patient has menstrual-associated TSS, which is often caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes.

TSS is a severe, life-threatening illness caused by the production of superantigens, which are bacterial toxins that activate a large number of T cells, leading to a massive release of cytokines and a systemic inflammatory response. The variable β-sequence of the T cell receptor is responsible for binding to the superantigen, which triggers the activation of T cells and the subsequent immune response.

The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of TSS:

A. B7 receptor: This is a co-stimulatory molecule involved in T cell activation, but it is not specific to TSS.

C. CD40: This is a receptor involved in B cell activation and is not directly related to TSS.

D. CD3: This is a component of the T cell receptor complex, but it is not specific to TSS.

E. IgCAM: This is an immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecule, which is not directly related to TSS.

It's worth noting that TSS is a medical emergency that requires prompt recognition and treatment, including removal of the tampon, administration of antibiotics, and supportive care to manage the patient's symptoms and prevent complications.",Success

A blood smear shows schistocytes. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?""",C,"The correct answer is C. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea, followed by pallor, lethargy, and laboratory findings, are consistent with HUS.
* The laboratory results show:
	+ Anemia (Hemoglobin 8.5 g/dL) with a normal mean corpuscular volume, suggesting hemolysis.
	+ Thrombocytopenia (Platelet count 45,000/mm3).
	+ Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, indicating hemolysis.
	+ Schistocytes on the blood smear, which are a hallmark of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.
	+ Elevated serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, indicating acute kidney injury.
* The patient's history of recent travel to Mexico and exposure to contaminated food or water increases the likelihood of HUS, which is often caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) or Shigella.
* The other options do not fit the patient's presentation and laboratory findings as well as HUS:
	+ A. Henoch-Schönlein Purpura is a vasculitis that typically presents with palpable purpura, arthritis, and abdominal pain, but it does not typically cause hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia.

"A 17-year-old girl is referred by her dentist for a suspected eating disorder. She has been visiting the same dentist since childhood and for the past 2 years has had at least 2 visits for dental caries. She eventually admitted to him that she regularly induces vomiting by putting her fingers down her throat. She says she has been doing this for the last few years and purging at least once a week. More recently, she has been inducing emesis more often and even looked into diuretics as she feels that she is gaining more and more weight compared to her ‘skinny friends’. Her BMI is at the 50th percentile for her age and sex. Which of the following features is most consistent with this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is C. Patients can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia.

This patient's symptoms are consistent with Bulimia Nervosa (BN). The key features of BN include:

* Recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by purging or compensatory behaviors (in this case, inducing vomiting and considering diuretics)
* Self-evaluation unduly influenced by body shape and weight
* Frequency of purging at least once a week

The patient's BMI at the 50th percentile for her age and sex suggests that she is not underweight, which is consistent with BN. In contrast, Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is characterized by a significantly low body mass index (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2).

Option C is correct because it is not uncommon for individuals to have a history of both AN and BN. Some people may start with AN and then develop BN, or vice versa.

Option A is incorrect because BN can be sub-typed into purging type (using laxatives, diuretics, or self-induced vomiting) and non-purging type (exercising excessively or fasting).

Option B is incorrect because while it's true that some patients with eating disorders may not initiate treatment, many do seek help, especially if they are experiencing physical or emotional distress.

Option D is incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, BN is not characterized by a low BMI. In fact, individuals with BN may have a normal or even overweight BMI.

Option E is incorrect because while BN can have significant medical complications (such as electrolyte imbalances, gastrointestinal problems, and tooth decay), not all patients with BN will experience these complications.",Success
"A 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her father because of fever, chills, abdominal pain, and profuse non-bloody diarrhea.

Her temperature is 39.3°C (102.8°F). Examination shows diffuse abdominal tenderness and mild hepatosplenomegaly. There is a faint salmon-colored maculopapular rash on her trunk and abdomen. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",D,"The correct answer is D. Salmonella typhi.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including fever, chills, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, are consistent with enteric fever, which is a systemic infection caused by Salmonella typhi or Salmonella paratyphi. The patient's travel history to Indonesia, where typhoid fever is endemic, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

The patient's initial symptoms of low-grade fever and constipation, followed by the development of diarrhea, are also consistent with the typical progression of typhoid fever. The presence of a faint salmon-colored maculopapular rash on the trunk and abdomen, known as a rose spot, is a classic feature of typhoid fever.

The other options are less likely:

A. Giardia lamblia is a parasite that causes giardiasis, which typically presents with diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and weight loss. While it's possible that the patient may have giardiasis, the presence of fever, chills, and hepatosplenomegaly makes typhoid fever a more likely diagnosis.

B. Schistosoma mansoni is a parasite that causes schistosomiasis, which typically presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and blood in the stool. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with schistosomiasis.

C. Campylobacter jejuni is a bacterium that causes campylobacteriosis, which typically presents with diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. While it's possible that the patient may have campylobacteriosis, the presence of hepatosplenomegaly and a rose spot makes typhoid fever a more likely diagnosis.

E. Clostridium perfringens is a bacterium that causes food poisoning, which typically presents with diarrhea and abdominal cramps. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with Clostridium perfringens infection.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), typhoid fever is a significant health problem in Indonesia, and travelers to this region are at increased risk of infection. The CDC recommends vaccination against typhoid fever for travelers to areas where the disease is common.",Success
"A 22-year-old female college student is treated with metronidazole after presenting to student health services with itching, discharge, and pain in her vagina. At a party shortly afterward she experiences facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps after consuming alcohol. Serum levels of which of the following are likely elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption:",A,"The correct answer is A. Acetaldehyde.

The patient is experiencing symptoms of a disulfiram-like reaction, which is a known side effect of metronidazole when combined with alcohol consumption. Metronidazole inhibits the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is responsible for breaking down acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of alcohol.

When alcohol is consumed, it is converted to acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. Normally, acetaldehyde is then broken down to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase. However, in the presence of metronidazole, the inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase leads to the accumulation of acetaldehyde, causing the symptoms observed in this patient, such as facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the interaction between metronidazole and alcohol:

* B. Uric acid is related to gout and kidney stone formation, not to the patient's symptoms.
* C. Cytochrome P-450 enzymes are a family of enzymes involved in drug metabolism, but they are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the interaction between metronidazole and alcohol.
* D. Triglycerides are a type of lipid, and elevated levels are associated with metabolic disorders, but they are not related to the patient's symptoms.
* E. Amylase is an enzyme involved in carbohydrate digestion, and elevated levels are associated with pancreatic disorders, but it is not related to the patient's symptoms.

It's essential to note that patients taking metronidazole should be advised to avoid consuming alcohol during treatment and for at least 24 hours after the last dose to prevent this interaction.",Success
"A 23-year-old primigravida presents for a regular prenatal care visit at 16 weeks gestation. She complains of increased fatigability, but is otherwise well. She takes folic acid, iron, and vitamin D supplementation. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 110/70 mm Hg; heart rate, 86/min; respiratory rate, 13/min; and temperature, 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The physical examination is unremarkable. The complete blood count results are as below:
Erythrocyte count 3.9 million/mm3
Hb 11.1 g/dL
HCT 32%
Reticulocyte count 0.2%
MCV 90 fL
Platelet count 210,000/mm3
Leukocyte count 8,100/mm3
Which of the following tests is required to investigate the cause of the patient’s laboratory findings?",D,"The correct answer is A. Serum iron level.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, as evidenced by the low hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11.1 g/dL and hematocrit (HCT) of 32%. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 90 fL suggests a normocytic anemia, which means that the red blood cells are of normal size.

Given the patient's iron supplementation, it is essential to investigate the cause of the anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is a common cause of anemia in pregnancy, especially during the second and third trimesters. A serum iron level test is necessary to determine if the patient has iron deficiency anemia.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's anemia:

B. Serum B12 level: While vitamin B12 deficiency can cause anemia, it is less likely in this patient, given her normal MCV and the absence of other symptoms suggestive of B12 deficiency.

C. Transferrin: Transferrin is a protein that binds to iron in the blood. While it can be used to assess iron status, it is not the most direct or specific test for iron deficiency anemia.

D. No tests required: This option is incorrect, as the patient's anemia needs to be investigated and managed to prevent complications during pregnancy.

E. Total bilirubin: Bilirubin levels are not directly related to the patient's anemia, and this test is not necessary to investigate the cause of her anemia.

In summary, a serum iron level test is necessary to determine if the patient has iron deficiency anemia, which is a common cause of anemia in pregnancy.",Success
"An 80-year-old man is transferred from a step-down unit to a med-surg floor in the hospital. He had undergone a successful hernia surgery 14 hours ago. Before the surgery, he was pre-treated with atropine, scopolamine, and morphine and recovered well in the PACU after the surgery. There were no complications in the step-down unit and the patient continued to recover. On the med-surg floor, his temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), the heart rate is 98/min, the respiratory rate is 15/min, the blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg, the oxygen saturation is 90%. On physical exam, he is a well-developed, obese man. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His incision site is clean, dry, and intact with an appropriate level of swelling and erythema. During the physical, the patient mentions some discomfort in his abdomen and pelvis and during a records review it is noted that he has not passed urine in the PACU, step-down unit, or since arriving on the med-surg floor. A bladder scan is inconclusive due to body habitus. What is the next best step in the treatment of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Insert a 'straight cath' into the patient's bladder.

The patient has not passed urine since the surgery, and this is a red flag for potential urinary retention. The bladder scan was inconclusive due to the patient's obesity, which makes it difficult to obtain an accurate reading. Given the patient's symptoms of abdominal and pelvic discomfort, it is likely that he has urinary retention.

Inserting a straight catheter (also known as an in-and-out catheter) is the next best step to relieve the urinary retention and assess the patient's urine output. This is a common complication after surgery, especially in older adults, and prompt intervention is necessary to prevent further complications such as urinary tract infections or kidney damage.

Option B, ultrasound of the surgical site, is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and would not address the issue of urinary retention. Option C, aggressive IV fluids, may be necessary to prevent dehydration, but it would not address the underlying issue of urinary retention. Option D, digital rectal exam, may be part of a complete physical exam, but it would not provide information about the patient's urinary retention. Option E, renal ultrasound, may be useful in evaluating kidney function, but it would not address the immediate issue of urinary retention.

It's essential to note that the patient's vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, are within normal limits, which suggests that the patient is not in distress. However, the urinary retention needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications.",Success
"A healthy 19-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of painless “blisters” in his mouth. He reports that he noticed a white film on his tongue and the sides of his mouth 2 days ago while brushing his teeth. The film was easily brushed off. He also complains of a bitter metallic taste in his mouth but otherwise denies pain, burning, dysphagia, or hoarseness. He is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. He is a competitive swimmer and has had 8 sexual partners in the past year. He intermittently uses barrier protection. On exam, he is well-appearing and in no acute distress. His oral examination demonstrates patches of white pseudomembranes that can be wiped away to reveal erythematous mucosa. A medication with which of the following mechanisms of action is most appropriate in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is C. Inhibition of 14-alpha-demethylase.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with oral candidiasis, also known as thrush. The white patches on the tongue and sides of the mouth that can be easily wiped away to reveal erythematous mucosa are characteristic of this condition.

The mechanism of action of the medication most appropriate for this patient is inhibition of 14-alpha-demethylase, which is the mechanism of action of azole antifungals such as fluconazole. Azoles work by inhibiting the enzyme 14-alpha-demethylase, which is necessary for the synthesis of ergosterol, a critical component of the fungal cell membrane. Without ergosterol, the fungal cell membrane becomes permeable, leading to cell death.

The other options are not directly related to the treatment of oral candidiasis:

A. Disruption of cell membrane permeability is a mechanism of action of amphotericin B, which is an antifungal medication, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient.

B. Disruption of microtubule formation is a mechanism of action of antimitotic agents, which are not used to treat fungal infections.

D. Inhibition of beta-glucan synthase is a mechanism of action of echinocandin antifungals, which are typically used to treat invasive fungal infections, not oral candidiasis.

E. Inhibition of squalene epoxidase is a mechanism of action of allylamine antifungals, which are used to treat dermatophyte infections, not oral candidiasis.

According to current guidelines, azole antifungals such as fluconazole are the recommended treatment for oral candidiasis.",Success
"A 56-year-old man presents to the clinic complaining of subacute back pain for the past month. The pain is described as a dull, constant ache that is worse at night. He could not recall any precipitating event except for an amateur weight-lifting competition that he participated in 2 months ago. Past medical history is significant for non-small cell lung cancer that was diagnosed and successfully treated. A PET scan 1 year ago demonstrated no recurrence. Physical exam was unremarkable except for some point tenderness along the lumbosacral area. What is the most likely imaging finding in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine.

Here's why:

The patient's history of non-small cell lung cancer and the development of subacute back pain, particularly at night, raises suspicion for metastatic disease. The point tenderness along the lumbosacral area on physical exam further supports this possibility. Lytic lesions are a common radiographic finding in metastatic bone disease, particularly in patients with lung cancer.

Option A, blastic lesions, are more commonly associated with prostate cancer metastases.

Option B, bulging disc impinging on lumbar spinal nerve, is a possible cause of back pain, but the patient's history and physical exam findings are more consistent with a malignant process.

Option D, narrowing of the lumbar disc space, is a finding more commonly associated with degenerative disc disease, which is unlikely to cause night pain.

Option E, sacroilitis and fusion of the lumbar spine, is a finding more commonly associated with inflammatory arthropathies, such as ankylosing spondylitis, which is not supported by the patient's history and physical exam findings.

The American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends that patients with a history of cancer and new-onset back pain undergo imaging with CT or MRI to evaluate for metastatic disease. In this patient, a lytic lesion on imaging would be a concerning finding for metastatic lung cancer.",Success
A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of severe abdominal pain and bilious vomiting for 6 hours. He has not had bowel movements in the past 24 hours. He appears ill. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F) and pulse is 122/min. Examination shows a distended abdomen. There is tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen; guarding and rebound tenderness are present. Bowel sounds are decreased. An x-ray of the abdomen shows dilated loops of bowel. He has been accompanied by his 14-year-old brother. The surgeon recommends an emergency laparotomy. The parents are away visiting friends and cannot be reached. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?,D,"The correct answer is D. Perform emergency laparotomy.

In this scenario, the 4-year-old boy is presenting with severe abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, and signs of peritonitis, which suggests a surgical emergency. The surgeon has recommended an emergency laparotomy, which is the most appropriate course of action to address the child's life-threatening condition.

In situations where a minor requires medical treatment, parental consent is typically necessary. However, in emergency situations where the child's life or health is at risk, medical professionals are authorized to provide necessary treatment without parental consent. This is known as ""implied consent"" or ""presumed consent.""

In this case, delaying surgery to obtain parental consent would put the child's life at risk, and it is not a viable option. Obtaining consent from the 14-year-old brother (Option A) or the patient himself (Option B) is not appropriate, as they are not legally authorized to provide consent. Obtaining a court order for surgery (Option C) would also cause unnecessary delay and is not necessary in this emergency situation.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform the emergency laparotomy (Option D) to address the child's life-threatening condition.",Success
"A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the hospital because of poor weight gain since birth. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation via normal vaginal delivery. He weighed 3005 g (6 lb, 10 oz) at birth and currently weighs 2835 g (6 lb, 4 oz). He has been latching on and breastfeeding well since birth. His mother has a history of Graves' disease and underwent near-total thyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy after her symptoms could not be controlled with antithyroid drugs. She is currently receiving L-thyroxine therapy. The patient's temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 176/min, and respirations are 42/min. He appears irritable. Examination shows a diaphoretic infant with a paucity of subcutaneous fat. There is swelling of the neck at the midline. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",C,"The correct answer is C. Transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies.

The patient's symptoms, such as poor weight gain, irritability, and diaphoresis, are consistent with neonatal thyrotoxicosis. The swelling of the neck at the midline suggests a goiter, which is a common finding in neonatal thyrotoxicosis.

The mother's history of Graves' disease and near-total thyroidectomy during pregnancy increases the risk of transplacental passage of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibodies. These antibodies can stimulate the fetal thyroid gland, leading to thyrotoxicosis in the newborn.

Option A, transplacental passage of thyroglobulin antibodies, is not typically associated with neonatal thyrotoxicosis. Thyroglobulin antibodies are often seen in autoimmune thyroiditis, but they do not stimulate the thyroid gland.

Option B, transplacental passage of thyroid peroxidase antibodies, is also not typically associated with neonatal thyrotoxicosis. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies are often seen in autoimmune thyroiditis, but they do not stimulate the thyroid gland.

Option D, transplacental viral infection, is unlikely to cause neonatal thyrotoxicosis.

Option E, opiate use in the mother, is not related to the patient's symptoms and is unlikely to cause neonatal thyrotoxicosis.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American Thyroid Association, recommend monitoring newborns of mothers with Graves' disease for signs of thyrotoxicosis, as they are at increased risk due to transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies.",Success
"A 57-year-old female with a past medical history of alcoholism presents to the emergency room vomiting bright red blood.

On physical examination, she has splenomegaly and a positive fluid wave. The remainder of her examination is within normal limits. The patient is stabilized with intravenous fluids, and her blood pressure improves. Subsequent emergent upper endoscopy reveals bleeding from the submucosal veins in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus, but no gastric bleed. In the endoscopy suite she also receives IV octreotide. After intervention and resolution of her acute bleed, which of the following pharmacologic agents is indicated?",D,"The correct answer is D. Nadolol.

The patient's symptoms and endoscopy findings are consistent with esophageal varices, a complication of portal hypertension often seen in patients with liver cirrhosis. The patient's history of alcoholism and physical examination findings of splenomegaly and a positive fluid wave support this diagnosis.

After the acute bleed is resolved, the goal of pharmacologic therapy is to prevent rebleeding. Nadolol, a non-selective beta blocker, is indicated in this scenario. Beta blockers reduce portal pressure by decreasing cardiac output and splanchnic blood flow, thereby reducing the risk of rebleeding from esophageal varices.

The other options are not indicated for this patient:

A. Phentolamine is an alpha-adrenergic blocker used to treat hypertension and pheochromocytoma, but it has no role in the management of esophageal varices.

B. Prazosin is an alpha-adrenergic blocker used to treat hypertension, but it is not indicated for esophageal varices.

C. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker used to treat hypertension and angina, but it is not indicated for esophageal varices.

E. Doxazosin is an alpha-adrenergic blocker used to treat hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia, but it is not indicated for esophageal varices.

"A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension, obesity, and alcoholic cirrhosis is seen in clinic for follow-up. He feels well and currently drinks 5 glasses of wine each night. Medications include atenolol and lisinopril. On physical exam, temperature is 98.1 deg F (36.7 deg C), blood pressure is 151/82 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, and respirations are 14/min. He has spider angiomata on his chest; no asterixis, jaundice, ascites, or peripheral edema is noted. Screening ultrasound reveals a new liver nodule, and follow up CT demonstrates a 2 cm right hepatic lobe lesion with enhancement in the arterial phase. No hypodense attenuation is seen on the venous or delayed phase. What is the next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is E. Observe and get follow-up imaging in 3 months.

Here's why:

The patient has a liver nodule that enhances in the arterial phase on CT, which is a characteristic feature of a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the lesion does not show hypodense attenuation on the venous or delayed phase, which suggests that it may not be a malignant lesion.

According to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines, a liver nodule with arterial phase enhancement and no washout on the venous or delayed phase is considered a ""probable HCC"" and should be followed up with imaging in 3-6 months to assess for growth or changes in characteristics.

Liver biopsy (Option A) is not recommended as the first step, as it carries a risk of bleeding and seeding of tumor cells. Surgical resection (Option B) and radiofrequency ablation (Option C) are treatment options for HCC, but they are not indicated at this stage without further characterization of the lesion. Sorafenib (Option D) is a systemic therapy for advanced HCC, but it is not indicated for a small, asymptomatic lesion like this one.

Therefore, the next step in management is to observe the lesion with follow-up imaging in 3 months to assess for growth or changes in characteristics, which is Option E.",Success
"A 66-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his wife due to abdominal distension and persistent somnolence for the past 2 weeks. The patient’s wife says that he has been sleeping much more than usual for the past 5 days. His bowel and bladder habit have not changed. His past medical history is significant for alcoholic liver cirrhosis. His vital signs include: pulse 76/min, respiratory rate 15/min, temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F) and blood pressure 122/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is altered and not responsive to commands. Oriented x 0. The abdomen is significantly distended. Shifting dullness is present and a positive fluid wave can be elicited. Hyperreflexia and asterixis are noted. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:

HCO3 26 mEq/L
An abdominal ultrasound shows surface nodularity compatible with cirrhosis but no other changes aside from ascites. An upper GI endoscopy is performed which shows gastric varices with no signs of active bleeding. An MRI of the brain is insignificant. What is the most likely precipitating factor that led to this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation with abdominal distension, altered mental status, and hyperreflexia suggests hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver cirrhosis. The laboratory findings support this diagnosis, particularly the elevated ammonia level (100 µg/dL, which is significantly higher than the reference range of 19-60 µg/dL). Ammonia is a byproduct of protein metabolism that is normally detoxified by the liver. In liver cirrhosis, the liver's ability to detoxify ammonia is impaired, leading to its accumulation in the blood and subsequent neurological symptoms.

The patient's abdominal examination reveals ascites, which is a common complication of liver cirrhosis. The presence of shifting dullness and a positive fluid wave on physical examination confirms this finding.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common precipitating factor for hepatic encephalopathy in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites. SBP is an infection of the ascitic fluid that can occur in the absence of any apparent source of infection. It is often caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, and can lead to a rapid deterioration of the patient's condition.

While the other options are possible complications of liver cirrhosis, they are less likely to be the primary precipitating factor in this patient's condition:

* Metabolic alkalosis (option B) is not a direct cause of hepatic encephalopathy, although it can occur as a complication of liver disease.
* Variceal gastrointestinal bleeding (option C) is a possible complication of liver cirrhosis, but the upper GI endoscopy did not show any signs of active bleeding.
* Portal vein thrombosis (option D) is a potential complication of liver cirrhosis, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms.
* Hypoglycemia (option E) is not supported by the laboratory findings, as the patient's glucose level is within normal range.

In summary, the patient's presentation and laboratory findings are consistent with hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.",Success

The patient is given 2 liters of Ringer lactate solution and morphine. Initial workup demonstrates that the patient’s pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and troponins are elevated. The patient is currently complaining of chest pain. Physical exam is notable for an uncomfortable young man with bruising over his chest wall. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Cardiac contusion.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation, including the history of a head-on collision, bruising over the chest wall, and elevated troponins, suggests a cardiac contusion. Cardiac contusion is a common injury resulting from blunt chest trauma, often seen in motor vehicle accidents. The elevated troponins indicate cardiac muscle damage, which is consistent with a cardiac contusion.

The patient's ECG showing sinus tachycardia is non-specific, but it can be seen in cardiac contusion. The elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is also consistent with cardiac contusion, as it can indicate left ventricular dysfunction.

Option B, Hemorrhage, is unlikely because the patient's blood pressure is not significantly low, and there is no mention of significant bleeding or hypovolemic shock.

Option C, Myocardial infarction, is possible but less likely. While the elevated troponins could suggest a myocardial infarction, the patient's young age and the mechanism of injury (blunt chest trauma) make cardiac contusion a more likely diagnosis.

Option D, Pulmonary contusion, is possible, given the patient's history of chest trauma, but the elevated troponins and PCWP suggest cardiac involvement, making cardiac contusion a more likely diagnosis.

Option E, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, is unlikely. While it can present with chest pain and elevated troponins, it is typically seen in postmenopausal women and is often triggered by emotional or physical stress. The patient's young age and the mechanism of injury make Takotsubo cardiomyopathy less likely.

In summary, based on the patient's presentation, including the history of blunt chest trauma, elevated troponins, and elevated PCWP, cardiac contusion is the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department for progressively worsening fatigue, malaise, fever, and abdominal pain. He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications. Which of the following will be the best treatment option for this patient?",C,"The correct answer is A. Adding dopamine to his treatment regimen.

The patient is presenting with signs of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a complication of advanced liver disease characterized by progressive renal failure, oliguria, and a low urine sodium level. The patient's history of cirrhosis, ascites, and recent infection (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) make HRS a likely diagnosis.

The key findings supporting HRS are:

1. Oliguria despite constant fluid intake
2. Low urine sodium level (<10 mmol/L)
3. Absence of proteinuria and hematuria
4. Elevated creatinine level (1.8 mg/dL) compared to admission (0.9 mg/dL)

In this scenario, adding dopamine to the treatment regimen is the best option. Dopamine is a vasopressor that can help improve renal perfusion and increase urine output in patients with HRS. It is often used in combination with albumin infusion, which the patient is already receiving.

The other options are not suitable for the following reasons:

B. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor that can worsen renal function in patients with HRS.

C. Liver transplantation is not a treatment for HRS, and the patient's current condition is not suitable for transplantation.

D. Switching cefotaxime to ceftriaxone is not relevant to the patient's current problem, which is HRS.

E. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) is a procedure used to treat portal hypertension, but it is not indicated for HRS.

The vital signs include: heart rate 110/min and blood pressure 146/78 mm Hg. The physical exam is notable for warm and slightly moist skin. She also exhibits a fine tremor in her hands when her arms are outstretched. The urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the best single treatment option for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Methimazole.

The patient's symptoms, including unintentional weight loss, feeling warm, and a fine tremor, are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The physical exam findings of warm and slightly moist skin, as well as a heart rate of 110/min, further support this diagnosis.

Methimazole is a thionamide medication that is commonly used as a first-line treatment for hyperthyroidism. It works by inhibiting the production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. Methimazole is effective in reducing symptoms and normalizing thyroid function in patients with hyperthyroidism.

Glucocorticoids (Option A) are not typically used to treat hyperthyroidism. While they may be used to treat related conditions such as Graves' ophthalmopathy, they are not a primary treatment for hyperthyroidism.

Propranolol (Option C) is a beta-blocker that may be used to treat symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tremors and palpitations, but it does not address the underlying thyroid hormone imbalance.

Radioiodine therapy (Option D) is a treatment option for hyperthyroidism, but it is typically reserved for patients who have failed medical therapy or have a contraindication to medication. It involves administering radioactive iodine to destroy part of the thyroid gland, which can lead to hypothyroidism.

Thyroidectomy (Option E) is a surgical treatment option for hyperthyroidism, but it is typically reserved for patients with large goiters or compressive symptoms.

In this case, methimazole is the best single treatment option for this patient, as it is a first-line medication for hyperthyroidism that can help reduce symptoms and normalize thyroid function.",Success
"A 21-year-old man comes to the physician because of pruritus and a hypopigmented rash on his upper body for 5 days. He first noticed the symptoms after returning from a business trip last week in the Bahamas. While he was there, he visited a couple of beaches and went hiking with some coworkers. The rash initially started as a single lesion on his upper back but since then has extended to his shoulders. He has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus controlled with an insulin pump. He works as an office manager and has no known exposure to melanocytotoxic chemicals. He has been sexually active with three female partners over the past year and uses condoms inconsistently. He is 183 cm (6 ft) tall and weighs 80 kg (176 lb); BMI is 23.9 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. A photograph of the rash is shown. One month ago, his hemoglobin A1C was 7.8%. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Potassium hydroxide preparation.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is tinea versicolor, a common fungal infection of the skin. The rash is characterized by hypopigmented macules or patches, often with a fine scale, and is commonly seen in young adults, especially in warm and humid climates.

A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation is a simple, in-office diagnostic test that can confirm the diagnosis of tinea versicolor. The test involves scraping the skin lesion with a scalpel or glass slide, mixing the scraped material with KOH, and examining it under a microscope. The presence of fungal hyphae and spores confirms the diagnosis of tinea versicolor.

The other options are not as likely to confirm the diagnosis:

A. Wood lamp examination: This test is used to diagnose conditions such as vitiligo, erythrasma, and porphyria, but it is not specific for tinea versicolor.

B. Skin culture: While a skin culture can grow the fungus, it is not a rapid or definitive diagnostic test for tinea versicolor.

D. Skin biopsy: A skin biopsy is not necessary for the diagnosis of tinea versicolor and may not show characteristic features of the condition.

E. Antinuclear antibody testing: This test is used to diagnose autoimmune conditions such as lupus, but it is not relevant to the diagnosis of tinea versicolor.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and inconsistent condom use are not directly related to the diagnosis of tinea versicolor.",Success
"A 5-year-old female is brought to a speech therapist for continuing work on improving her communication skills. She is only able to verbalize two word sentences and has generalized developmental delay. When she was born it was noticed that she had a high pitched mewing cry and subsequent physical exam revealed microcephaly, prominent epicanthal folds, and a holosystolic murmur best heard in the left 5th intercostal space near the sternum. An abnormality of which of the following chromosomes is most likely responsible for this patient's disorder?",A,"The correct answer is E. 21.

The patient's symptoms, including microcephaly, prominent epicanthal folds, and a holosystolic murmur, are consistent with Down syndrome. Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21, resulting in a total of 47 chromosomes instead of the typical 46. This is also known as trisomy 21.

The patient's high-pitched mewing cry is also a common feature of Down syndrome. Additionally, the patient's developmental delay and limited communication skills are also consistent with Down syndrome.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Chromosome 5 abnormalities are associated with Cri-du-chat syndrome, which presents with a characteristic high-pitched cry, but the other symptoms do not match.

B. Chromosome 7 abnormalities are associated with Williams syndrome, which presents with a distinctive facial appearance, but not with microcephaly or holosystolic murmur.

C. Chromosome 13 abnormalities are associated with Patau syndrome, which presents with severe intellectual disability, but not with the specific symptoms described in this patient.

D. Chromosome 18 abnormalities are associated with Edwards syndrome, which presents with severe intellectual disability, but not with the specific symptoms described in this patient.

It's worth noting that the diagnosis of Down syndrome is typically made through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and genetic testing, such as karyotyping or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).",Success
"A 62-year old female comes to the physician because of vaginal spotting and urinary urgency for the past 4 days. She has had no fever, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Menopause occurred at 52 years of age. Her last Pap smear 1 year ago was normal. She has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. Medications include atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and aspirin. She is sexually active with her husband. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 155/65 mm Hg. Pelvic exam demonstrates a 4 x 3 cm firm, immobile erythematous mass on the right inner vaginal wall. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Biopsy of the mass.

Here's why:

The patient presents with vaginal spotting and urinary urgency, and a pelvic exam reveals a 4 x 3 cm firm, immobile, erythematous mass on the right inner vaginal wall. This mass is a significant finding that requires further evaluation. Given the patient's age and menopausal status, the mass could be a benign or malignant lesion.

A biopsy of the mass is the most appropriate next step in management to determine the nature of the lesion. This will help to establish a diagnosis and guide further treatment. The biopsy can be performed in the office or in an operating room, depending on the size and location of the mass.

Option A, Pap smear, is not relevant in this scenario, as the patient's last Pap smear was normal, and the current symptoms and physical findings suggest a vaginal wall lesion rather than a cervical abnormality.

Option C, loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), is a treatment for cervical dysplasia or carcinoma in situ, which is not the primary concern in this case.

Option D, incision and drainage, is not indicated, as there is no evidence of an abscess or fluid collection that requires drainage.

Option E, urine gonorrhea and chlamydia testing, may be relevant if the patient had symptoms or signs of a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as abnormal discharge, itching, or burning. However, the patient's symptoms and physical findings are more consistent with a vaginal wall lesion than an STI.

Therefore, a biopsy of the mass is the most appropriate next step in management to determine the nature of the lesion and guide further treatment.",Success
"A 59-year-old man is evaluated for progressive joint pain. There is swelling and tenderness over the first, second, and third metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands. His hand radiograph is shown. He has had diabetes mellitus for 2 years which is not well controlled with medications. Lab studies show a transferrin saturation of 88% and serum ferritin of 1,200 ng/mL. Which of the following best represents the etiology of this patient condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Deposition of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals.

The patient's symptoms, such as swelling and tenderness over the metacarpophalangeal joints, and the radiograph findings are consistent with a diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease, also known as pseudogout. CPPD is a type of crystal-induced arthropathy characterized by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals in the joints.

The laboratory results, including an elevated transferrin saturation and serum ferritin, suggest that the patient has hemochromatosis, a genetic disorder that can increase the risk of developing CPPD. Hemochromatosis is a common comorbidity with CPPD, and the presence of both conditions in this patient supports the diagnosis.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Deposition of urate crystals would be consistent with gout, which typically affects the big toe (first metatarsophalangeal joint) rather than the metacarpophalangeal joints.

C. Degenerative joint disorder, such as osteoarthritis, would not typically cause the acute inflammation and crystal deposition seen in this patient.

D. Inflammatory rheumatological syndrome, such as rheumatoid arthritis, would typically cause more widespread joint involvement and systemic symptoms, which are not described in this patient.

E. Pathogenic inoculation of microbes would suggest an infectious etiology, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American College of Rheumatology, support the diagnosis of CPPD based on the presence of characteristic radiographic findings, joint inflammation, and laboratory evidence of crystal deposition.",Success
"A newborn is found to be extremely cyanotic immediately after birth. He then develops progressive respiratory failure and is admitted to the neonatal ICU. A single loud S2 heart sound is appreciated as well as a machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border. Radiography shows an enlarged ""egg-shaped"" heart. The newborn is then taken for a atrial septostomy to alleviate the condition pending definitive surgical correction. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this newborn's condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Transposition of great vessels.

Here's why:

* The symptoms described, such as extreme cyanosis immediately after birth and progressive respiratory failure, are consistent with a congenital heart defect that impairs oxygenation.
* The physical examination findings, including a single loud S2 heart sound and a machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border, are also consistent with transposition of the great vessels.
* The radiographic finding of an enlarged ""egg-shaped"" heart is a classic feature of transposition of the great vessels.
* The need for an atrial septostomy to alleviate the condition pending definitive surgical correction further supports this diagnosis. In transposition of the great vessels, the atrial septum is often intact, and an atrial septostomy is performed to create a communication between the atria, allowing for some mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.

The other options do not fit the clinical presentation as well:

* A. Coarctation of the aorta would not typically cause cyanosis or an ""egg-shaped"" heart.
* B. Persistent truncus arteriosus would likely cause a loud, harsh murmur, but not a machine-like murmur, and the heart shape would not be typically ""egg-shaped"".
* C. Tetralogy of Fallot would cause cyanosis, but the heart shape would not be ""egg-shaped"", and the murmur would be more likely to be a harsh, systolic murmur.
* E. Tricuspid atresia would cause cyanosis, but the heart shape would not be ""egg-shaped"", and the murmur would be more likely to be a systolic murmur.

Transposition of the great vessels is a congenital heart defect in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle, resulting in deoxygenated blood being pumped to the body and oxygenated blood being pumped to the lungs. It is a life-threatening condition that requires urgent medical attention and surgical correction.",Success
"A 25-year-old male involved in a knife fight presents with a penetrating wound to the chest. The patient is unconscious and cannot provide any further history.

On physical examination, the patient is diaphoretic and unresponsive. Extremities are pale and cool. There is a 3-inch long penetrating wound between the 3rd and 4th intercostal space on the left side of the chest, which is bleeding profusely. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. There are no apparent injuries to any coronary arteries or major branches. The patient is intubated and aggressive fluid resuscitation is initiated, including a blood transfusion. Which of the following is the best definitive surgical approach to take in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets.

The patient presents with a penetrating wound to the chest, specifically to the right ventricular free wall, which is bleeding profusely. This is a life-threatening injury that requires immediate surgical intervention. The patient is already intubated and receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation, including a blood transfusion.

The best definitive surgical approach in this scenario is to repair the penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall using interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets. This is a standard surgical technique for repairing cardiac wounds, as it provides a secure and durable closure of the injury.

Option A, immediate cardiac transplant, is not a viable option in this scenario. While the patient has a severe cardiac injury, transplantation is not a suitable solution for a penetrating wound that can be repaired surgically.

Option B, watchful waiting while resuscitative fluids are initiated, is not appropriate, as the patient's life-threatening bleeding requires immediate surgical intervention.

Option D, needle thoracostomy over the 2nd intercostal space, is not relevant to the patient's cardiac injury and would not address the bleeding from the penetrating wound.

Option E, surgical adhesive glue, is not a suitable option for repairing a penetrating cardiac wound. While surgical adhesives can be used in certain situations, they are not a substitute for suturing in this scenario.

The American College of Surgeons' Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) guidelines recommend that patients with penetrating cardiac injuries undergo immediate surgical repair. The European Society of Cardiology's guidelines for the management of cardiac trauma also recommend surgical repair as the primary treatment for penetrating cardiac injuries.",Success
"A post-mortem lung examination of a 68-year-old male overweight male with evidence of chronic lower extremity edema, a 60 pack-year smoking history and daily productive cough would be most likely to reveal:",B,"The correct answer is B. Reid Index > 50%.

Here's why:

The patient's history suggests chronic bronchitis, which is a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's symptoms, such as daily productive cough, chronic lower extremity edema, and 60 pack-year smoking history, are consistent with this diagnosis.

The Reid Index is a measure of the ratio of the thickness of the mucous gland layer to the thickness of the bronchial wall. In chronic bronchitis, the mucous gland layer is hyperplastic, leading to an increased Reid Index. A Reid Index > 50% is a characteristic feature of chronic bronchitis.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and history:

A. Hypereosinophilia is a characteristic feature of eosinophilic granuloma, a rare lung disease.

C. Non-caseating granulomas are typically seen in sarcoidosis, a systemic granulomatous disease.

D. Evidence of a necrotizing infection would suggest a severe bacterial pneumonia, which is not consistent with the patient's chronic symptoms.

E. Keratin pearls are a feature of squamous cell carcinoma, a type of lung cancer.

Therefore, based on the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely finding on post-mortem lung examination would be a Reid Index > 50%, consistent with chronic bronchitis.",Success
A 54-year-old male makes an appointment with his primary care physician due to chronic fatigue that has left him unable to hike or do other physically demanding activities with his friends. He has well-controlled hypertension and diabetes but has otherwise been healthy. He does not smoke but drinks socially with his friends. Physical exam reveals enlarged nodules that are not tender to palpation. A biopsy is obtained showing a characteristic change in chromosome 18. The regulation of which of the following proteins will be most abnormal in this patient?,B,"The correct answer is D. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, it is likely that the patient has follicular lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The characteristic change in chromosome 18 mentioned in the question is a translocation, t(14;18), which is a hallmark of follicular lymphoma.

This translocation leads to the overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2, which inhibits programmed cell death (apoptosis). As a result, the regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) is affected. CDK4 is a key regulator of the cell cycle, and its dysregulation can contribute to the development and progression of cancer.

The other options are not directly related to the characteristic change in chromosome 18 or the pathogenesis of follicular lymphoma:

A. Caspase-8 is involved in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, but it is not directly related to the t(14;18) translocation.

B. Caspase-9 is involved in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, but it is not directly related to the t(14;18) translocation.

C. CD15 is a surface antigen that is not specific to follicular lymphoma and is not directly related to the t(14;18) translocation.

E. Ras pathway transcription factors are involved in cell signaling and proliferation, but they are not directly related to the t(14;18) translocation or the pathogenesis of follicular lymphoma.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4.",Success
A 44-year-old African-American woman comes to the physician for a routine examination. She is concerned about cancer because her uncle died of metastatic melanoma 1 year ago. She has no history of serious illness and does not take any medication. She has been working in a law firm for the past 20 years and travels to the Carribean regularly with her husband. Examination of her skin shows no abnormal moles or warts. This woman is at greatest risk of which of the following types of melanoma?,C,"The correct answer is C. Acral lentiginous.

Here's why:

Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is a type of melanoma that occurs on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nail beds. It is more common in darker-skinned individuals, particularly African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, ALM accounts for 35-60% of melanoma cases in African Americans.

The patient's African American ethnicity and lack of skin examination findings increase her risk for ALM. Although she has a family history of melanoma, it is not a strong risk factor for ALM specifically.

Desmoplastic melanoma (Option A) is a rare type of melanoma that typically occurs on the head and neck of older individuals.

Nodular melanoma (Option B) is a type of melanoma that can occur anywhere on the body, but it is more common in Caucasians.

Lentigo maligna (Option D) is a type of melanoma that typically occurs on the face and ears of older individuals, often in areas exposed to the sun.

Superficial spreading melanoma (Option E) is the most common type of melanoma, but it is more common in Caucasians and typically occurs on sun-exposed areas.

The patient's travel history to the Caribbean may increase her risk of skin cancer in general, but it does not specifically increase her risk of ALM.",Success

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 65 mm/h
C-reactive protein 44 mg/dL
For which of the symptoms below should the patient be screened?",B,"The correct answer is B. Jaw claudication.

The patient's symptoms, including difficulty combing her hair in the morning, stiff neck, and bilateral shoulder tenderness, are consistent with giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis. The laboratory results, particularly the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), support this diagnosis.

Jaw claudication is a classic symptom of GCA, and patients with this condition should be screened for it. Jaw claudication is characterized by pain or fatigue in the jaw muscles when chewing, which is often relieved by rest.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Uveitis is a symptom of various conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, but it is not specifically related to GCA.

C. Heliotrope rash is a characteristic symptom of dermatomyositis, a different autoimmune condition.

D. Gastroesophageal reflux is a common symptom of various conditions, but it is not related to GCA.

E. Pink plaques with silvery scales are characteristic of psoriasis, a skin condition that is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

She has taken ibuprofen for the pain, which has provided some relief. Menses have occurred at regular 29-day intervals since menarche at the age of 14 years and last for 7 days. She is sexually active with her husband and does not use contraception. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic and bimanual examinations are normal; rectal examination is unremarkable. A hysterosalpingogram 6 months prior showed normal results. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity.

The patient's symptoms, including episodic pelvic and back pain, painful diarrhea, and difficulty conceiving, are consistent with endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside the uterus, leading to inflammation, scarring, and adhesions. This can cause pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and infertility.

The patient's history of regular menses and normal hysterosalpingogram results make options A, B, C, and E less likely. Option A, loss of fallopian tube function following infection, would likely cause irregular menses or amenorrhea, which is not seen in this patient. Option B, smooth muscle tumor arising from the myometrium, would likely cause abnormal uterine bleeding or a palpable mass, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Option C, increased secretion of prolactin, would likely cause galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and infertility, but the patient's menses are regular. Option E, increased secretion of androgens and luteinizing hormone, would likely cause hirsutism, acne, and irregular menses, which are not seen in this patient.

The medical history is also relevant for myocardial infarction 3 years ago and hypertension for the past 10 years, for which he takes lisinopril. His blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, the pulse is 82/min, the respirations are 18/minute, and the temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F). On examination, several hemorrhages are noted on the nail beds of several fingers. Which of the following findings would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is A. Thickened valve with multiple small vegetations.

The patient's symptoms, such as fever and weakness, along with the presence of hemorrhages on the nail beds (also known as Osler's nodes), suggest a diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE). IE is a serious infection of the heart valves, often caused by bacterial or fungal pathogens.

Given the patient's history of tricuspid valve replacement surgery, the most likely diagnosis is prosthetic valve endocarditis. The presence of multiple small vegetations on the valve, as described in option A, is a characteristic finding in IE. Vegetations are abnormal growths on the valve that can be seen on echocardiography or during surgery.

Option B, bicuspid valve, is a congenital heart defect that is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis. Option C, friable irregular masses attached to the valve, could be a description of vegetations, but it is not as specific or clear as option A. Option D, papillary muscle rupture, is a complication of myocardial infarction, which is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms. Option E, annular calcification, is a finding that may be seen in degenerative valve disease, but it is not specific to IE.

The diagnosis of IE is typically made based on a combination of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, including blood cultures, echocardiography, and physical examination. In this case, the presence of multiple small vegetations on the valve would be a key finding in establishing a diagnosis of IE.",Success
A previously healthy 30-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of pain during sexual intercourse for 6 months. She also reports frequent episodes of crampy pelvic pain that starts one day before menses and lasts for 7 days. Her symptoms are not relieved with pain medication. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 days. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with her husband. She uses a combined oral contraceptive pill. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows rectovaginal tenderness. Cervical and urethral swabs are negative. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,C,"The correct answer is C. Laparoscopy.

This patient's symptoms are consistent with endometriosis, a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, leading to pain, especially during menstruation and sexual intercourse. The patient's history of crampy pelvic pain starting one day before menses and lasting for 7 days, rectovaginal tenderness on physical examination, and negative cervical and urethral swabs support this diagnosis.

Laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis, as it allows for direct visualization of the pelvic cavity and identification of endometrial implants. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends laparoscopy as the most accurate diagnostic test for endometriosis.

Measuring CA-125 levels (Option A) may be useful in evaluating ovarian masses, but it is not a specific test for endometriosis and may be elevated in other conditions.

Hysterectomy (Option B) is not a suitable next step in management, as it is a major surgical procedure that is not indicated for the diagnosis or initial treatment of endometriosis.

Hysteroscopy (Option D) is a procedure that allows visualization of the inside of the uterus, but it is not useful for diagnosing endometriosis, which typically affects the pelvic cavity outside the uterus.

A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (Option E) is not necessary in this case, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with endometriosis, and a CT scan would not provide additional diagnostic information.

Therefore, laparoscopy is the most appropriate next step in management to confirm the diagnosis of endometriosis and guide further treatment.",Success

Which of the following lab abnormalities in this patient is an indication for treatment?",D,"The correct answer is D. High LDL-cholesterol.

Let's break down the patient's laboratory results and identify the abnormalities that require treatment:

* Fasting serum glucose: 105 mg/dL (normal range: 70-100 mg/dL). This is considered impaired fasting glucose, but it is not an indication for treatment at this level. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), a diagnosis of diabetes requires a fasting glucose level of ≥126 mg/dL.
* Blood pressure: 130/90 mm Hg (prehypertension). While this is an abnormality, it is not an indication for treatment at this stage. According to the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA), lifestyle modifications are recommended for patients with prehypertension, but pharmacological treatment is not initiated until the blood pressure reaches 140/90 mm Hg or higher.
* Weight: The patient is obese, but this is not a laboratory abnormality. Obesity is a risk factor for various diseases, but it is not an indication for treatment in itself.
* Triglyceride levels: 170 mg/dL (normal range: <150 mg/dL). While this is an abnormality, it is not an indication for treatment at this level. According to the National Lipid Association, triglyceride levels between 150-199 mg/dL are considered borderline high, and lifestyle modifications are recommended. Pharmacological treatment is typically reserved for patients with triglyceride levels ≥200 mg/dL.
* LDL-cholesterol: 186 mg/dL (normal range: <130 mg/dL). This is an indication for treatment. According to the ACC and the American Heart Association, an LDL-cholesterol level ≥190 mg/dL is considered high risk, and pharmacological treatment with a statin is recommended.

In summary, the patient's high LDL-cholesterol level is the laboratory abnormality that requires treatment.",Success

An x-ray of the chest shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is B. Traumatic bronchial rupture.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms and signs, such as respiratory distress, decreased breath sounds over the left lung base, and deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, suggest a significant injury to the left lung.
* The chest x-ray findings, including depression of the left mainstem bronchus and a widened mediastinum, are consistent with a bronchial rupture.
* The patient's hypoxia (oxygen saturation of 70% on room air) and tachypnea (29/min) also support this diagnosis.
* While diaphragmatic rupture (Option A) can cause respiratory distress, it would typically present with abdominal contents in the chest cavity, which is not mentioned in this scenario.
* Thoracic aortic rupture (Option C) can cause a widened mediastinum, but it would typically present with more severe hypotension and potentially cardiac tamponade, which is not the primary presentation in this case.
* Cardiac tamponade (Option D) would typically present with more severe hypotension, jugular venous distension, and muffled heart sounds, which are not mentioned in this scenario.
* Tension pneumothorax (Option E) would typically present with more severe respiratory distress, tracheal deviation, and decreased breath sounds on the affected side, but the x-ray findings do not support this diagnosis.

On physical exam, the patient is mildly diaphoretic. The skin is warm and the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged with thyroid bruits. Laboratory studies are significant for a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.01 µU/mL (normal is 0.5-5.0 µU/mL) and an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) that is inappropriate for her pregnancy. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Propylthiouracil.

The patient is presenting with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as anxiety, trouble sleeping, palpitations, and fatigue, which are consistent with an overactive thyroid gland. The physical exam findings of a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with thyroid bruits and a mildly diaphoretic skin also support this diagnosis. The laboratory results, including a suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) level, confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.

In pregnancy, the treatment of hyperthyroidism is critical to prevent complications for both the mother and the fetus. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommends that pregnant women with hyperthyroidism be treated with antithyroid medications, specifically propylthiouracil (PTU), during the first trimester.

Propylthiouracil is the preferred medication during pregnancy because it has a lower risk of birth defects compared to methimazole. Methimazole (option A) is not recommended during the first trimester due to its association with a higher risk of birth defects, such as aplasia cutis and choanal atresia.

Observation (option B) is not a suitable option, as untreated hyperthyroidism during pregnancy can lead to complications such as preterm labor, low birth weight, and fetal distress.

Radioiodine therapy (option D) is contraindicated during pregnancy, as it can cause fetal thyroid damage and is not recommended for women of childbearing age.

Thyroidectomy (option E) may be considered in some cases, but it is not the first-line treatment for hyperthyroidism during pregnancy. Surgery carries risks, and medical therapy with antithyroid medications is generally preferred.

Therefore, the best treatment option for this patient is propylthiouracil (option C).",Success

The liver is firm and palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpable just below the left costal margin. Her leukocyte count is 12,800/mm3 (12% eosinophils). Stool culture shows several oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines. Microscopic examination of a liver biopsy specimen shows granulomatous inflammation with periportal fibrosis. Exposure to which of the following is most likely to have played a role in the development of this patient's symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is E. Freshwater snails.

The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and liver biopsy findings are consistent with a diagnosis of schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma species. The presence of oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines in the stool culture is a characteristic feature of Schistosoma mansoni, a species commonly found in Africa, including Uganda.

Schistosomiasis is typically acquired through contact with contaminated freshwater, such as lakes, rivers, or ponds, where infected freshwater snails (Biomphalaria species) release cercariae, which penetrate human skin. The patient's recent immigration from Uganda and exposure to freshwater sources in that region make it likely that she acquired the infection through contact with contaminated water.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and diagnosis:

A. Tsetse flies are vectors of trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), not schistosomiasis.

B. Undercooked pork meat is associated with trichinosis, not schistosomiasis.

C. Undercooked fish meat is associated with various parasitic infections, such as anisakiasis or diphyllobothriasis, but not schistosomiasis.

D. Dog feces are associated with toxocariasis, a parasitic infection caused by Toxocara species, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.

It is essential to note that schistosomiasis is a significant public health problem in many parts of the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Healthcare providers should be aware of the risk factors and diagnostic features of this infection to provide appropriate diagnosis and treatment.",Success
"A 3-month-old girl is brought to a pediatrician by her parents. She has central cyanosis without signs of respiratory distress or signs of heart failure. An echocardiogram reveals severe pulmonary outflow obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy, a ventricular septal defect, and an overriding of the aorta. An elective primary surgical repair is planned at 4 months of age. Which of the following statements is true about this girl’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Normal hemoglobin in patients with tetralogy of Fallot does not rule out iron deficiency anemia.

The patient's symptoms and echocardiogram findings are consistent with tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect characterized by pulmonary outflow obstruction, ventricular septal defect, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta.

Option B is correct because patients with tetralogy of Fallot are at risk of iron deficiency anemia due to chronic hypoxia, which can lead to increased red blood cell production and increased iron demand. Even with normal hemoglobin levels, iron deficiency anemia can still occur.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. The most common valve affected by bacterial endocarditis in uncorrected tetralogy of Fallot is the pulmonary valve, not the tricuspid valve.

C. Cerebral venous thrombosis is more common than cerebral arterial thrombosis in patients with tetralogy of Fallot, particularly in those with polycythemia (increased red blood cell count) secondary to chronic hypoxia.

D. Refractory heart failure is not a common complication of tetralogy of Fallot, especially if surgical repair is performed early in life. Heart failure can occur if the defect is left uncorrected, but it's not a typical complication of the condition.

E. The most common age of presentation for brain abscess in patients with tetralogy of Fallot is typically later in childhood, often between 2-5 years of age, not between 6-12 months.

It's essential to note that tetralogy of Fallot is a complex condition, and patients require close monitoring and follow-up care to prevent and manage potential complications.",Success
"Six days after undergoing surgical repair of a hip fracture, a previously healthy 79-year-old woman is agitated and confused. She is unarousable during the day, but then is awake and impulsive during the night, requiring frequent reorientation. Her husband says that she usually drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly. Her only current medication is oxycodone for pain. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is distressed and oriented to person but not to place or time. Neurologic examination shows inattentiveness but no focal deficits. Urine dipstick is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her current condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Delirium.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as agitation, confusion, disorientation to place and time, inattentiveness, and fluctuating levels of consciousness, are consistent with delirium. Delirium is a common complication in older adults, especially after surgery, and is often triggered by factors such as pain, medication, and environmental changes.

Option A, dementia, is unlikely because the patient's symptoms are acute and reversible, whereas dementia is a chronic and progressive condition. While the patient may have some underlying cognitive impairment, the sudden onset of symptoms suggests a different cause.

Option B, alcohol withdrawal, is also unlikely because the patient's wine consumption is minimal, and her symptoms do not match the typical presentation of alcohol withdrawal, which often includes autonomic instability, tremors, and hallucinations.

Option C, opioid intoxication, is possible but less likely because the patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and her symptoms are more consistent with delirium than opioid overdose.

Option E, urinary tract infection, is also unlikely because the patient's urine dipstick is normal, and her symptoms are not typical of a UTI.

The diagnosis of delirium is supported by the patient's acute onset of symptoms, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and inattention, which are all characteristic features of delirium. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), delirium is a neurocognitive disorder characterized by a disturbance in attention and awareness, accompanied by a change in cognition or perceptual disturbance that develops over a short period of time.",Success
"A 54-year-old woman with a past medical history of mental retardation, hypertension, and diabetes presents to the emergency department with a change in her behavior. Her caretakers state that the patient’s gait suddenly became ataxic, and she became less responsive than her normal non-verbal baseline. Her temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 125/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an unremarkable HEENT exam with normal facial features and no signs of airway compromise. Neurological exam is remarkable for new onset spasticity. The patient has 3+ reflexes and a positive Babinski sign. Musculoskeletal exam is only notable for symmetric swelling and deformities of the patient’s hands bilaterally. Additionally, there is a ""clunk"" when posterior force is applied to the head while anterior force is applied to the cervical spine. Which of the following is the most likely risk factor that predisposed this patient to this condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Rheumatoid arthritis.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is atlanto-axial instability (AAI) secondary to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The ""clunk"" when posterior force is applied to the head while anterior force is applied to the cervical spine is a positive ""clunk test,"" which is indicative of AAI.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a well-known risk factor for atlanto-axial instability due to the erosive and inflammatory nature of the disease, which can lead to destruction of the ligaments and joints in the cervical spine. This can result in instability and subluxation of the atlanto-axial joint, leading to compression of the spinal cord and brainstem.

The other options are not directly related to the development of atlanto-axial instability:

A. Cerebral palsy is a neurological disorder that affects muscle tone and movement, but it is not typically associated with atlanto-axial instability.

B. Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that can cause a range of complications, but it is not a known risk factor for atlanto-axial instability.

C. Down syndrome is a genetic disorder that can cause a range of physical and intellectual disabilities, but it is not typically associated with atlanto-axial instability.

D. Hypertension is a cardiovascular disorder that can cause a range of complications, but it is not a known risk factor for atlanto-axial instability.

It's worth noting that the patient's mental retardation and symmetric swelling and deformities of the hands bilaterally are likely related to her underlying rheumatoid arthritis, which can cause joint deformities and disability.",Success
"A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after he sustained a stab wound to the left chest just below the clavicle. On arrival, he has rapid, shallow breathing and appears anxious. His pulse is 135/min, respirations are 30/min and shallow, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 80 mm Hg. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. Five minutes later, his pulse is 133/min and blood pressure is 82/45 mm Hg. Examination shows no active external bleeding. There is a 2.5-cm single stab wound to the left chest at the 4th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Cardiovascular examination shows muffled heart sounds and jugular venous distention. Breath sounds are normal. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",C,"The correct answer is C. A drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition that occurs when fluid accumulates in the pericardial space and compresses the heart. The stab wound to the left chest has likely caused bleeding into the pericardial space, leading to tamponade.

The physical examination findings that support this diagnosis include:

* Muffled heart sounds: This is due to the fluid accumulation in the pericardial space, which dampens the heart sounds.
* Jugular venous distension: This is caused by the increased pressure in the thoracic cavity, which impedes venous return to the heart.
* Normal breath sounds: This suggests that the patient's respiratory symptoms are not due to a pulmonary injury or pneumothorax.

The Beck's triad, which consists of hypotension, jugular venous distension, and muffled heart sounds, is a classic presentation of cardiac tamponade.

Option C, a drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration, is a key finding in cardiac tamponade. This is known as pulsus paradoxus, which is a decrease in systolic blood pressure during inspiration due to the increased pressure in the thoracic cavity.

The other options are not directly related to cardiac tamponade:

* A. Tracheal deviation toward the right side would suggest a tension pneumothorax, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.
* B. Hemoptysis would suggest a pulmonary injury, which is not supported by the patient's normal breath sounds.
* D. Herniation of the stomach into the chest would suggest a diaphragmatic injury, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.
* E. Paradoxical motion of part of the chest with breathing would suggest a flail chest, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.",Success
"A 40-year-old man presents to his primary-care doctor for a follow-up of his hypertension. He is asymptomatic at his office visit and denies any new complaints. He has a 10-year history of hypertension that remains poorly controlled on maximum doses of lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and amlodipine. His past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. He has no smoking history, drinks alcohol occasionally, and denies any illicit drug use. His father required a kidney transplant in his forties. The physical exam is notable for palpable flank masses bilaterally. Laboratory studies show a creatinine of 2.5. The physician orders a renal ultrasound, and the results are shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate test to screen for additional complications of this patient's condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. MR angiography of the brain.

The patient's presentation with palpable flank masses bilaterally and a creatinine of 2.5 suggests a diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). The renal ultrasound results likely show bilateral kidney cysts, which is a hallmark of PKD.

PKD is a genetic disorder that can affect multiple organs, including the brain. One of the common complications of PKD is intracranial aneurysms, which can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Therefore, screening for intracranial aneurysms is recommended in patients with PKD.

MR angiography of the brain is a non-invasive imaging modality that can detect intracranial aneurysms with high sensitivity and specificity. It is the most appropriate test to screen for this complication in this patient.

The other options are not directly related to the complications of PKD:

A. Colonoscopy: While PKD can increase the risk of colon cancer, there is no indication for colonoscopy in this patient.

B. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy: There is no indication for esophagogastroduodenoscopy in this patient, as PKD is not typically associated with gastrointestinal complications.

C. Liver function tests: While PKD can affect the liver, liver function tests are not a screening test for complications of PKD.

E. Serum amylase and lipase: These tests are used to diagnose pancreatitis, which is not a common complication of PKD.

It's worth noting that the patient's family history of kidney transplant in his father also supports the diagnosis of PKD, which has a genetic component.",Success
"A 17-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her father because she has been experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain. She says that the chest pain is worse when she breathes or coughs. Furthermore, on the way to the hospital she noticed that there were specks of blood on a tissue that she coughed into. She has no previous medical history and does not recall anything that could have provoked these symptoms. On presentation her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 107/65 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, respirations are 21/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Further testing shows a large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels, and the patient is started on an appropriate treatment intravenously. After drug administration, the effects of the drug are monitored using a standard blood test. Surprisingly, the test results come back within normal parameters. The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms has which of the following modes of inheritance?",A,"The correct answer is D. X-linked dominant.

Based on the patient's symptoms and the presence of a large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels, it is likely that the patient has pulmonary embolism (PE). The fact that the patient is started on an appropriate treatment intravenously and the effects of the drug are monitored using a standard blood test suggests that the treatment is anticoagulation therapy, likely with heparin or a low-molecular-weight heparin.

The standard blood test used to monitor the effects of anticoagulation therapy is the partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The fact that the test results come back within normal parameters suggests that the patient has a deficiency of antithrombin III, a protein that helps to regulate the clotting cascade.

Antithrombin III deficiency is an inherited disorder that has an X-linked dominant mode of inheritance. This means that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition, and it is more common in females than males.

Autosomal dominant inheritance (Option A) would require a single copy of the mutated gene to cause the condition, but it would not explain the X-linked pattern of inheritance. Autosomal recessive inheritance (Option B) would require two copies of the mutated gene to cause the condition, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Autosomal partial dominance (Option C) is not a recognized mode of inheritance. X-linked recessive inheritance (Option E) would require two copies of the mutated gene to cause the condition in females, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.",Success
"A 26-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with complaints of burning with urination, penile discharge, and intermittent fevers. A urethral smear shows gram negative diplococci within white blood cells. The organism grows well when cultured on Thayer-Martin agar. The patient is prescribed a course of ceftriaxone and the infection resolves without further complication. One year later, the patient returns with the same infection. Which of the following best explains this lack of lasting immunity?",B,"The correct answer is B. Antigenic variation.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, also known as gonorrhea. The gram-negative diplococci within white blood cells on the urethral smear and the growth on Thayer-Martin agar are characteristic of N. gonorrhoeae.

The lack of lasting immunity in this patient is due to antigenic variation, which is a key feature of N. gonorrhoeae. This bacterium has a high degree of genetic variability, particularly in its outer membrane proteins, which allows it to evade the host's immune system and reinfect the same individual multiple times. This means that even if the patient develops antibodies against a specific strain of N. gonorrhoeae, these antibodies may not be effective against subsequent infections with different strains.

The other options are not directly related to the lack of lasting immunity in this scenario:

A. Exotoxin release is a mechanism used by some bacteria to cause disease, but it is not relevant to the lack of immunity in this case.

C. Polysaccharide capsule is a feature of some bacteria, including N. meningitidis, but it is not the primary reason for the lack of immunity to N. gonorrhoeae.

D. Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a lack of immunoglobulins, but it is not a likely explanation for the patient's recurrent infections.

E. Lack of necessary vaccination is not applicable, as there is no vaccine available against N. gonorrhoeae.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emphasize the importance of antibiotic treatment and partner notification for gonorrhea, but do not provide a vaccine or guarantee lasting immunity against the infection.",Success
"A 37-year-old man with no significant past medical history is rear-ended in a motor vehicle accident. He reported significant neck pain to emergency responders, but otherwise denies weakness, numbness or tingling in his extremities. His vitals on presentation to the ED are HR 90, BP 140/80, RR 20, SpO2 98%. What is the most appropriate next step upon presentation to the emergency room?",C,"The correct answer is C. Cervical immobilization.

Here's why:

The patient has reported significant neck pain after a motor vehicle accident, which raises concerns about potential cervical spine injury. The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) guidelines recommend that patients with suspected cervical spine injury should be immobilized to prevent further injury.

Cervical immobilization is a crucial step in the initial management of patients with potential cervical spine injury. It involves stabilizing the neck using a cervical collar or other immobilization devices to prevent movement and reduce the risk of further injury.

While imaging studies such as lateral cervical film (Option A) or three-view cervical spine series (Option B) may be necessary to evaluate the cervical spine, they should not be performed until the patient is properly immobilized.

IV methylprednisolone (Option D) is not indicated in this scenario, as there is no evidence of spinal cord injury or neurological deficit.

Observation overnight (Option E) may be necessary depending on the patient's clinical course, but it is not the most appropriate next step upon presentation to the emergency room.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to immobilize the patient's cervical spine to prevent further injury.",Success
"A 43-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia, currently controlled with medication, comes in for an appointment with his internist. He is concerned about abnormal discharge from both nipples over the past 3 months. The fluid is white, and he wonders if it could be milk. On further review of systems, he endorses a diminished sexual drive. The physician suspects that one of the patient's medications may be the culprit for these symptoms. Which of the following medications is NOT likely to be the cause?",C,"The correct answer is C. Bromocriptine.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, specifically galactorrhea (abnormal milk discharge from the nipples) and decreased libido, are consistent with hyperprolactinemia (elevated prolactin levels). This is often caused by medications that block dopamine receptors, leading to increased prolactin secretion.

Metoclopramide (A) is a dopamine antagonist, commonly used to treat gastrointestinal disorders, which can cause hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea.

Haloperidol (B) and Fluphenazine (D) are both antipsychotic medications that can also cause hyperprolactinemia due to their dopamine-blocking effects.

Risperidone (E) is an atypical antipsychotic that can also increase prolactin levels, although to a lesser extent than typical antipsychotics like haloperidol and fluphenazine.

Bromocriptine (C), on the other hand, is a dopamine agonist, which means it stimulates dopamine receptors. It is often used to treat hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea caused by other medications. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms.

In summary, the patient's symptoms are consistent with hyperprolactinemia, and all the options except bromocriptine are medications that can cause this condition due to their dopamine-blocking effects.",Success

Serum
Bilirubin, total 11.3 mg/dL
Direct 0.3 mg/dL
Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?""",E,"The correct answer is C. Anti-D antibodies.

Here's why:

The patient is a 2-day-old newborn with jaundice, and the laboratory studies show a total bilirubin level of 11.3 mg/dL, with a direct bilirubin level of 0.3 mg/dL. This suggests an indirect hyperbilirubinemia, which is consistent with hemolysis.

The presence of anti-Rh antibody titer in the mother's blood and the fact that the fetal blood group is Rh-negative suggest that the mother has developed antibodies against the Rh antigen, which can cause hemolysis in the newborn. This is known as hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) or erythroblastosis fetalis.

The other options can be ruled out:

A. RBC enzyme deficiency: This would not cause hemolysis in the first 2 days of life, and the reticulocyte count is elevated, which suggests that the bone marrow is responding to hemolysis.

B. RBC sickling: The patient's brother has sickle cell disease, but this is not relevant to the patient's current condition. The patient's hemoglobin level is 11 g/dL, which is normal, and there is no evidence of sickling on the complete blood count (CBC).

D. Biliary duct malformation: The direct bilirubin level is normal, which suggests that there is no obstruction of the biliary ducts.

E. Anti-B antibodies: The mother's blood group is 0, and the fetal blood group is B, but there is no evidence of anti-B antibodies in the mother's blood.

In summary, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is hemolytic disease of the newborn due to anti-D antibodies.",Success
"A 65-year old man presents with gradually worsening rigidity of his arms and legs and slowness in performing tasks. He says he has also noticed hand tremors, which increase at rest and decrease with focused movements. On examination, the patient does not swing his arms while walking and has a shortened, shuffling gait. An antiviral drug is prescribed which alleviates the patient’s symptoms. Which of the following drugs was most likely prescribed to this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Amantadine.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as rigidity, slowness, hand tremors, and a shuffling gait, are consistent with Parkinson's disease. Amantadine is an antiviral drug that is sometimes used to treat Parkinson's disease, particularly in the early stages. It has been shown to improve motor symptoms, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slowness of movement).

Amantadine's mechanism of action in Parkinson's disease is not fully understood, but it is thought to increase the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is depleted in Parkinson's disease.

The other options are not likely to be prescribed for this patient:

* Ribavirin (B) is an antiviral drug used to treat viral infections such as hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
* Acyclovir (C) is an antiviral drug used to treat herpes simplex and herpes zoster infections.
* Levodopa (D) is a dopamine precursor used to treat Parkinson's disease, but it is not an antiviral drug.
* Zidovudine (E) is an antiretroviral drug used to treat HIV infection.

It's worth noting that while amantadine can be used to treat Parkinson's disease, it is not a first-line therapy and is often used in combination with other medications. Additionally, the patient's symptoms should be regularly monitored, and the medication regimen may need to be adjusted over time.",Success
The patient is given prophylactic labetalol and magnesium sulfate. Examination shows absent deep tendon reflexes bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?,A,"The correct answer is A. Stop magnesium sulfate and give calcium gluconate.

Here's why:

The patient is experiencing absent deep tendon reflexes bilaterally, which is a sign of magnesium toxicity. Magnesium sulfate is commonly used as a prophylactic medication to prevent eclampsia in pregnant women, but it can cause muscle weakness, respiratory depression, and loss of deep tendon reflexes as side effects.

Calcium gluconate is the antidote for magnesium toxicity, and it can help reverse the effects of magnesium on the neuromuscular system. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to stop the magnesium sulfate infusion and administer calcium gluconate.

Option B, stopping labetalol, is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and is not the primary concern. Labetalol is an antihypertensive medication used to control blood pressure, and it is not related to the patient's absent deep tendon reflexes.

Option C, stopping magnesium sulfate and giving lorazepam, is also not correct. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be used to treat anxiety or seizures, but it is not indicated for magnesium toxicity.

Option D, performing nerve conduction studies, is not necessary at this point. While nerve conduction studies can be used to diagnose neuromuscular disorders, they are not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and would not change the management of magnesium toxicity.

Option E, performing an emergency cesarean section, is not indicated based on the patient's symptoms. While the patient is pregnant and receiving prophylactic medications, the absent deep tendon reflexes are a sign of magnesium toxicity, which needs to be addressed first.

In summary, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to stop the magnesium sulfate infusion and administer calcium gluconate to reverse the effects of magnesium toxicity.",Success

Here's why:

The patient's presentation is consistent with myxedema coma, a life-threatening complication of hypothyroidism. The key findings that support this diagnosis are:

1. Altered mental status and decorticate posturing, indicating severe neurological impairment.
2. Hypothermia (temperature 33.0°C or 91.4°F), which is a hallmark of myxedema coma.
3. Bradycardia (pulse 40/min) and hypotension (blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg), which are common in hypothyroidism.
4. Dry, coarse, and waxy skin, as well as non-pitting edema around the face and extremities, which are characteristic of myxedema.
5. Laboratory results showing severely elevated TSH (110.0 µU/mL) and low T4 (1.2 µg/dL) and T3 (70 ng/dL) levels, indicating severe hypothyroidism.

B. Pheochromocytoma crisis is unlikely due to the absence of hypertension, tachycardia, and other symptoms typical of this condition.

C. Septic shock is unlikely due to the absence of fever, tachycardia, and other signs of infection.

D. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is unlikely due to the normal calcium level (9.0 mg/dL) and the absence of other signs and symptoms of hyperparathyroidism.

E. Thyroid storm is unlikely due to the patient's hypothyroid state, as evidenced by the low T4 and T3 levels, and the absence of symptoms such as fever, tachycardia, and tremors.

In addition, an S3 heart sound is also present. Bounding pulses are palpated at the radial arteries bilaterally. Which of the following diagnoses is most likely in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Aortic regurgitation.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, particularly with exertion, suggest cardiac-related dyspnea.
* The physical examination findings are crucial in making a diagnosis:
	+ The early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border is consistent with aortic regurgitation.
	+ The midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border may indicate aortic stenosis, but the presence of a diastolic murmur takes precedence.
	+ The late diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex suggests mitral stenosis, but this is less likely given the prominent aortic regurgitation murmur.
	+ The S3 heart sound indicates left ventricular dysfunction, which is often seen in aortic regurgitation.
	+ Bounding pulses at the radial arteries bilaterally are a classic sign of aortic regurgitation, as the regurgitant flow into the left ventricle increases the stroke volume and pulse pressure.

Aortic regurgitation is the most likely diagnosis based on the combination of these physical examination findings. The patient's age, hypertension, and lack of other significant medical history also support this diagnosis.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* A. Mitral regurgitation: While the patient has a late diastolic rumbling murmur, the prominent aortic regurgitation murmur and bounding pulses suggest aortic regurgitation is the primary diagnosis.
* B. Mitral stenosis: The late diastolic rumbling murmur could suggest mitral stenosis, but the aortic regurgitation murmur and bounding pulses are more prominent.
* D. Aortic stenosis: The midsystolic murmur could suggest aortic stenosis, but the early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur and bounding pulses are more consistent with aortic regurgitation.
* E. Mitral prolapse: This diagnosis is unlikely given the lack of a midsystolic click or late systolic murmur, and the presence of aortic regurgitation murmurs and bounding pulses.",Success

2. Emotional dysregulation: She exhibits intense emotional shifts, alternating between sobbing and anger, which is a hallmark of BPD.
3. Manipulative behavior: The patient's attempt to manipulate her boyfriend's feelings by attempting suicide and her behavior towards hospital staff (spitting at them) suggest a pattern of manipulative behavior.
4. Unstable relationships: The patient has a history of turbulent relationships, both romantic and familial, which is a common feature of BPD.
5. Lack of significant past medical history: This rules out other potential causes for her behavior, such as a underlying medical condition or substance abuse.

While the other options are plausible, they do not fit the patient's presentation as well as BPD:

A. Histrionic personality disorder is characterized by excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behavior, but it does not typically involve self-harming behavior or impulsivity to the same extent as BPD.

C. Dependent personality disorder is marked by an excessive need for others to take care of one's emotional and physical needs, which is not evident in this patient's behavior.

D. Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by social withdrawal and fear of rejection, which is not consistent with the patient's impulsive and manipulative behavior.

E. Narcissistic personality disorder is marked by grandiosity, entitlement, and a lack of empathy, which is not evident in this patient's presentation.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), the diagnostic criteria for BPD include a pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and emotions, as well as marked impulsivity. The patient's behavior and history are consistent with these criteria, making BPD the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 50-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor following an inguinal hernia repair. The patient reports no pain in his lower abdomen or groin, no constipation, and states that he enjoys his usual diet. He denies any use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. He has returned to work as a cruise ship attendant. Preoperative workup included chest radiography which demonstrated an opacification in his right middle lobe. The patient agrees to undergo computed tomography (CT) of his chest without contrast for further evaluation. The radiologist reports an 8 mm nodule in the patient's peripheral right middle lobe that has regular margins and appears calcified. One year later, the patient obtains another chest CT without contrast that reports the nodule size as 10 mm with similar characteristics. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is A. CT chest without contrast in 12 months.

Here's why:

The patient has a small, calcified nodule in the right middle lobe, which is likely a benign lesion. The Fleischner Society guidelines for the management of incidental pulmonary nodules recommend follow-up imaging for nodules <8 mm in diameter. Since the nodule has grown from 8 mm to 10 mm over a year, it's essential to continue monitoring its size and characteristics.

Option A, CT chest without contrast in 12 months, is the most appropriate next step. This will allow for continued surveillance of the nodule's growth rate and morphology, which will help determine if it's benign or malignant.

Option B, CT chest without contrast in 24 months, is not appropriate because the nodule has already demonstrated growth, and a longer follow-up period may delay diagnosis or treatment if the nodule is malignant.

Option C, PET scan of the chest now, is not necessary at this stage. PET scans are typically used to evaluate the metabolic activity of a lesion, which is not required for a small, calcified nodule.

Option D, right middle lobectomy now, is not justified based on the current findings. Surgery is usually reserved for nodules that are highly suspicious for malignancy or have shown significant growth.

Option E, bronchoscopy-guided biopsy now, is also not necessary. Bronchoscopy is typically used to evaluate central airway lesions or to obtain tissue samples for diagnosis. In this case, the nodule is peripheral, and a biopsy is not warranted at this stage.

By choosing option A, the patient will undergo continued surveillance, and the healthcare provider can reassess the nodule's growth rate and characteristics, making it possible to determine the best course of action in the future.",Success
"A 29-year-old man comes in for evaluation of infertility. He has been trying to conceive for over 2 years with his wife and previous evaluation of his wife's fertility revealed no abnormalities. Physical exam reveals a tall man with long extremities, sparse body hair, gynecomastia, and small testes. Laboratory studies reveal increased serum follicle-stimulating hormone concentration and an increased estradiol:testosterone ratio. Genetic studies reveal a cytogenetic abnormality. If this abnormality was inherited from the patient's father, at which stage of spermatogenesis did this error most likely occur?",A,"The correct answer is D. Spermatogonium.

The patient's physical exam and laboratory findings are consistent with Klinefelter syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome (47, XXY). This is confirmed by the presence of a cytogenetic abnormality.

Klinefelter syndrome is typically caused by a non-disjunction event during meiosis, which is the process by which gametes (sperm or eggs) are formed. In this case, the error occurred during spermatogenesis in the patient's father.

The correct stage of spermatogenesis where this error occurred is during the formation of spermatogonia, which are the diploid stem cells that give rise to sperm. Specifically, the error occurred during the meiotic division of the spermatogonia in the father, resulting in a sperm with an extra X chromosome.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Primary spermatocyte: This stage occurs after the spermatogonia have undergone DNA replication and entered meiosis. The error had already occurred by this stage.

B. Secondary spermatocyte: This stage occurs after the first meiotic division, and the error had already occurred by this stage as well.

C. Spermatid: This stage occurs after meiosis is complete, and the error had already occurred earlier in the process.

E. Spermatozoon: This is the mature sperm, and the error had already occurred during the formation of the sperm, not during the final stages of sperm maturation.

It's worth noting that Klinefelter syndrome can also occur due to a non-disjunction event during oogenesis (egg formation) in the mother, but in this case, the question states that the abnormality was inherited from the patient's father, making spermatogonium the correct answer.",Success
"A 13-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with severe knee, hip, and groin pain. The patient has a past medical history notable only for obesity and asthma. His temperature is 98°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 124/65 mmHg, pulse is 128/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an inability of the patient to bear weight on his left leg and limited range of motion of the left hip. Which of the following is the best management for this patient?",E,"The correct answer is D. Surgical drainage of the hip.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is septic arthritis of the hip, specifically a hip joint infection. The patient's severe pain, inability to bear weight, and limited range of motion are all consistent with this diagnosis.

Septic arthritis is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent long-term joint damage and potential systemic complications. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) recommend urgent surgical drainage of the hip joint to remove the infected fluid and debris.

The other options are not appropriate for the management of septic arthritis:

A. Casting and crutches would not address the underlying infection and could potentially worsen the condition.

B. Immobilization of the hip in a Pavlik harness is used for developmental dysplasia of the hip, not septic arthritis.

C. Supportive therapy and observation would delay definitive treatment and increase the risk of complications.

E. Surgical pinning of the femoral head is not indicated for septic arthritis and may be necessary for other conditions, such as a femoral neck fracture.

It's essential to note that septic arthritis requires prompt antibiotic therapy in addition to surgical drainage. The patient should be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and then transitioned to targeted therapy based on culture results.",Success
"A 28-year-old man comes to the physician because of diarrhea and crampy abdominal pain for 5 weeks. He has had up to 4 bowel movements per day. Several times he noticed mucoid strings with the stool. He has abdominal bloating. Over the past month, has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss. He has not had fever, cough, or bloody stools. He had a painful rash on his lower extremity 3 weeks ago that resolved spontaneously. He works as a pharmacy technician. His temperature is 37.3°C (98.8°F), pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 115/77 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft and nontender. His hemoglobin concentration is 11.9 g/dL, MCV is 79 fL, ferritin is 106 ng/dL, and platelet count is 410,000/mm3; serum concentrations of glucose, creatinine, and electrolytes are within the reference range. This patient's condition is most likely associated with which of the following findings?",C,"The correct answer is E. Normal intestinal mucosa.

The patient's symptoms, including diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, mucoid strings in the stool, and weight loss, are consistent with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically ulcerative colitis. The presence of a painful rash on the lower extremity that resolved spontaneously suggests a possible extraintestinal manifestation of IBD, such as erythema nodosum.

The laboratory results, including a normal complete blood count (CBC), electrolyte panel, and renal function tests, do not suggest any alternative diagnoses. The elevated platelet count may be a reactive thrombocytosis due to chronic inflammation.

Option E, normal intestinal mucosa, is the correct answer because ulcerative colitis is characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the colonic mucosa, but the mucosa can appear normal between episodes of active inflammation. This is in contrast to Crohn's disease, which often involves transmural inflammation and can lead to fibrosis and stricture formation.

Option A, mucosal lactase deficiency, is unlikely because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with lactose intolerance, and lactase deficiency is typically diagnosed with a hydrogen breath test or lactose tolerance test.

Option B, increased serum VIP, is associated with VIPoma, a rare pancreatic tumor that causes watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Option C, stool leukocytes, is not a characteristic finding in ulcerative colitis, which typically presents with bloody stools or mucus, but not leukocytes.

Option D, melanosis coli, is a condition characterized by brown or black pigmentation of the colonic mucosa due to the accumulation of anthraquinone, a component of certain laxatives. It is not related to the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with ulcerative colitis, and the correct answer is E, normal intestinal mucosa.",Success
"A 51-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, abdominal pain, and confusion. His wife states that he has been unable to recall his birthday or her name. He was diagnosed with hepatitis C 3 years ago but refused treatment. He has been treated twice in the past year for acute pancreatitis. There is no family history of serious illness. His only medication is a calcium supplement. He emigrated from India 15 years ago. He appears ill. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 104/68 mm Hg. He is confused and oriented only to person. Examination shows scleral icterus and spider angiomas. There are fine tremors of the hands bilaterally. The abdomen is distended and shifting dullness is present. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding. Bowel sounds are absent. Laboratory studies show:

Paracentesis is performed. Ascitic fluid analysis shows an albumin concentration of 0.8 g/dL, glucose concentration of 62 mg/dL, and a leukocyte count of 1900/mm3 with 60% neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""",D,"The correct answer is D. Bacterial translocation.

Here's why:

The patient presents with fever, abdominal pain, and confusion, which suggests a severe infection. The physical examination reveals scleral icterus, spider angiomas, and fine tremors of the hands, indicating liver disease. The abdominal examination shows distension, shifting dullness, and diffuse tenderness, consistent with ascites.

The laboratory studies show:

* Low albumin levels, indicating liver dysfunction
* Elevated total bilirubin levels, indicating liver disease
* Mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, which can be seen in liver disease
* Normal AST and ALT levels, which is unusual in liver disease, but can be seen in cases of liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension

The paracentesis results are crucial in making the diagnosis:

* Low ascitic fluid albumin concentration (<1 g/dL) suggests a high protein gradient between the serum and ascitic fluid, consistent with portal hypertension
* Elevated ascitic fluid leukocyte count (>250/mm3) with a high percentage of neutrophils (>50%) suggests an infectious process

Given the patient's history of liver disease (hepatitis C) and the presence of portal hypertension, the most likely explanation for these findings is bacterial translocation. Bacterial translocation occurs when bacteria from the gut lumen migrate through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream, causing infection. This is a common complication of cirrhosis, particularly in patients with portal hypertension.

The other options are not supported by the clinical and laboratory findings:

A. Pancreatic fluid leakage would not explain the patient's fever, confusion, and ascitic fluid findings.

B. Aseptic peritoneal inflammation would not explain the elevated ascitic fluid leukocyte count and neutrophilia.

C. Neoplastic growth would not explain the patient's acute presentation and ascitic fluid findings.

E. Perforated viscus would typically present with more severe abdominal tenderness, guarding, and a higher ascitic fluid leukocyte count.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for these findings is bacterial translocation, which is a common complication of cirrhosis.",Success
"An 18-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department because of a cough that her parents are worried about. She has had a runny nose and a low-grade fever for the past 2 days, with some hoarseness and a rough-sounding cough that started this afternoon. This evening she began making some high-pitched sounds when taking breaths, and she seemed to be having some trouble breathing. She is alert and does not appear to be in acute distress. She has a temperature of 38.0°C (100.4 °F), with a respiratory rate of 50/min and O2 saturation of 97%. There is audible inspiratory stridor that worsens when she starts to cry during the examination. She has an occasional barking cough. Her pharynx is mildly erythematous with normal tonsils and no exudate. A frontal X-ray of the upper chest airways is obtained (shown in the image). Which of the following is the best step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Racemic epinephrine and intramuscular corticosteroid therapy.

This patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of croup, a viral infection that causes inflammation of the upper airway, particularly the subglottic region. The characteristic features of croup include:

* Hoarseness
* Barking cough
* Inspiratory stridor
* Low-grade fever
* Mild respiratory distress

The frontal X-ray of the upper chest airways shows the classic ""steeple sign,"" which is a narrowing of the tracheal air column, consistent with subglottic narrowing.

The best step in management is to administer racemic epinephrine and intramuscular corticosteroid therapy. Racemic epinephrine helps to reduce airway edema and relieve symptoms, while corticosteroids reduce inflammation and swelling in the airway.

Option A, obtaining additional radiographs of the neck, is not necessary at this point, as the diagnosis of croup is already suspected based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination.

Option B, intubation, is not indicated unless the patient's respiratory distress worsens or they show signs of impending respiratory failure.

Option D, intravenous antibiotics, is not necessary, as croup is typically a viral infection and antibiotics would not be effective.

Option E, a trial of bronchodilator therapy and oral steroids, may be considered in some cases of croup, but racemic epinephrine and intramuscular corticosteroid therapy are the more effective and recommended treatments.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend the use of racemic epinephrine and corticosteroids as the primary treatment for croup.",Success
"A 43-year-old woman presents with complaints of retrosternal burning associated with eating. It has persisted for the past several years but has been getting worse. Her past medical history is unknown and this is her first time seeing a doctor. She states she is otherwise healthy and review of systems is notable for episodic hand pain that is worse in the winter as well as a chronic and severe cough with dyspnea which she attributes to her smoking. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 174/104 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a young appearing woman with coarse breath sounds. Laboratory studies and urinalysis are ordered and currently pending. Which of the following is the pathophysiology of this patient's chief complaint?",B,"The correct answer is A. Decreased lower esophageal tone.

The patient's symptoms of retrosternal burning associated with eating are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) fails to close properly, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus, causing symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation.

Decreased lower esophageal tone, or relaxation of the LES, is the primary pathophysiological mechanism underlying GERD. This relaxation allows the stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus, causing the symptoms. The other options are not directly related to the pathophysiology of GERD:

* B. Esophageal fibrosis is a condition characterized by scarring of the esophagus, which is not typically associated with GERD.
* C. Increased lower esophageal tone would actually prevent GERD, as a tighter LES would prevent stomach acid from flowing back into the esophagus.
* D. Spastic cricopharyngeal muscle is related to dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and is not directly related to GERD.
* E. Uncoordinated esophageal peristalsis is related to dysmotility disorders, such as achalasia, which is a different condition from GERD.

It's worth noting that the patient's other symptoms, such as hand pain and chronic cough with dyspnea, may be related to other underlying conditions, such as Raynaud's disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively. However, these symptoms are not directly related to the patient's chief complaint of retrosternal burning.",Success

Hemoglobin 8.6 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 90 μm3
Reticulocyte count 0.5%
Serum
Ferritin 325 ng/mL
Urea nitrogen 45 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.2 mg/dL
The patient is prescribed a drug to treat the cause of his current symptoms. The drug's mechanism of action directly involves which of the following signaling pathways?""",D,"The correct answer is D. JAK/STAT.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest anemia, which is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. The patient's hemoglobin level is 8.6 g/dL, indicating anemia. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 90 μm3, which is normal, ruling out microcytic anemia. The reticulocyte count is 0.5%, indicating inadequate red blood cell production.

Given the patient's history of chronic kidney disease and anemia, the most likely cause of his symptoms is erythropoietin (EPO) deficiency. EPO is a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates red blood cell production in the bone marrow. In chronic kidney disease, the kidneys may not produce enough EPO, leading to anemia.

The drug prescribed to treat the patient's anemia is likely an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA), such as epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa. These drugs work by binding to the EPO receptor on red blood cell precursors, stimulating their proliferation and differentiation. The EPO receptor is a transmembrane receptor that activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, leading to the transcription of genes involved in red blood cell production.

The other options are not directly related to the mechanism of action of ESAs:

A. PI3K/Akt/mTOR is a signaling pathway involved in cell survival and growth, but it is not directly related to EPO signaling.

B. cAMP is a second messenger involved in various signaling pathways, but it is not directly related to EPO signaling.

C. MAP kinase is a signaling pathway involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, but it is not directly related to EPO signaling.

E. IP3 is a second messenger involved in calcium signaling, but it is not directly related to EPO signaling.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. JAK/STAT.",Success
"A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of muscle cramping, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. He says that these symptoms came on rapidly but does not recall anything that may have triggered the episode. He has never experienced these symptoms before. His past medical history is significant for obesity, sleep apnea, and type 2 diabetes that is well controlled on metformin. He also has gastroesophageal reflux disease for which he occasionally takes antacids. On presentation he is found to have fast, shallow breathing and abdominal pain that is poorly localized. Basic labs as well as an arterial blood gas are obtained and the results are shown below:

Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 106 mEq/L
HCO3-: 11 mEq/L
pH: 7.25
pCO2: 22 mmHg

Which of the following is the most likely cause of the changes seen in this patient's labs?",D,"The correct answer is C. Diarrhea.

Let's break down the lab results and the patient's symptoms to justify this choice:

* The patient presents with diarrhea, which is a key symptom in this scenario.
* The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a metabolic acidosis, characterized by a low pH (7.25) and low bicarbonate (HCO3-) level (11 mEq/L).
* The anion gap, which is calculated by subtracting the sum of chloride and bicarbonate from the sodium level, is normal (approximately 12-15 mEq/L). This suggests that the acidosis is not due to an accumulation of unmeasured anions, such as lactate or ketones.
* The patient's chloride level is low (106 mEq/L), which is consistent with a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.
* The patient's symptoms, including muscle cramping, decreased appetite, and diarrhea, are consistent with a gastrointestinal cause of the acidosis.

Given these findings, the most likely cause of the changes seen in this patient's labs is diarrhea, which has led to a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis due to the loss of bicarbonate-rich fluids. This is supported by the patient's symptoms and the lab results.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:

* A. Antacids: While antacids can affect acid-base balance, they would not cause a metabolic acidosis with a normal anion gap.
* B. Anxiety: Anxiety would not cause a metabolic acidosis, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with an anxiety-related disorder.
* D. Metformin: Metformin is not typically associated with metabolic acidosis, and the patient's diabetes is well-controlled.
* E. Sleep apnea: Sleep apnea can cause respiratory acidosis, but the patient's ABG results show a metabolic acidosis, which is not consistent with sleep apnea.",Success
"A scientist is studying the properties of myosin-actin interactions in a sample of human muscle tissue. She has identified a drug that selectively inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head. If she gives this drug to a sample of human muscle tissue under physiologic conditions, which of the following steps in cross-bridge cycling will most likely be blocked?",E,"The correct answer is E. Power stroke.

Here's why:

In the cross-bridge cycling of muscle contraction, the myosin head binds to actin, undergoes a conformational change (cocking), and then releases phosphate, which triggers the power stroke. The power stroke is the movement of the myosin head along the actin filament, generating force and shortening the muscle.

If the drug selectively inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head, it will prevent the power stroke from occurring. Without phosphate release, the myosin head will not undergo the conformational change necessary for the power stroke, and muscle contraction will be blocked.

The other options are not directly affected by the inhibition of phosphate release:

A. Myosin head release from actin: This step occurs after the power stroke, so it's not directly affected by the drug.

B. Myosin head cocking: Cocking occurs before phosphate release, so the drug won't prevent it.

C. Exposure of myosin-binding sites on actin: This step occurs before myosin head binding, so it's not related to phosphate release.

D. Myosin head binding to actin: Binding occurs before phosphate release, so the drug won't prevent it.

By inhibiting phosphate release, the drug specifically blocks the power stroke, which is the critical step in generating muscle force and contraction.",Success

Neurological examination shows decreased strength in the right lower leg with normal strength in the other extremities. Fundoscopic examination shows several multinodular, calcified lesions in the retina bilaterally. A photograph of his skin findings is shown. This patient's condition is most likely due to a mutation in which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is D. TSC1 gene on chromosome 9.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). The key features that support this diagnosis are:

1. Seizure disorder: TSC is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by seizures, intellectual disability, and benign tumors in various organs.
2. Cognitive delay: Intellectual disability is a common feature of TSC.
3. Right lower extremity weakness: This suggests a neurological deficit, which is consistent with TSC.
4. Holosystolic murmur: Cardiac rhabdomyomas are common in TSC, and a murmur may be audible.
5. Multinodular, calcified lesions in the retina: These are characteristic of retinal hamartomas, which are seen in TSC.
6. Skin findings: The photograph likely shows hypopigmented macules (ash leaf spots) or Shagreen patches, which are typical skin manifestations of TSC.

TSC is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9 or the TSC2 gene on chromosome 16. The TSC1 gene is responsible for encoding the protein hamartin, which is involved in regulating cell growth and differentiation.

The other options are not correct because:

A. NF1 gene on chromosome 17: This is associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1, which is characterized by café-au-lait spots, neurofibromas, and optic gliomas.

B. NF2 gene on chromosome 22: This is associated with Neurofibromatosis type 2, which is characterized by bilateral vestibular schwannomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas.

C. GNAQ gene on chromosome 9: This is associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome, which is characterized by a port-wine stain, glaucoma, and leptomeningeal angiomas.

E. VHL gene on chromosome 3: This is associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease, which is characterized by hemangioblastomas, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytomas.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is Tuberous Sclerosis Complex due to a mutation in the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9.",Success

Cl-: 99 mEq/L
K+: 4.8 mEq/L
HCO3-: 11 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 177 mg/dL
Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's laboratory derangements?",D,"The correct answer is D. Metformin.

The patient's laboratory results show a metabolic acidosis with a low bicarbonate level (11 mEq/L) and an elevated anion gap (calculated anion gap = 141 - 99 - 11 = 31, which is elevated). The patient's creatinine level is also elevated at 3.1 mg/dL, indicating renal impairment.

Metformin, an oral hypoglycemic agent, is known to cause lactic acidosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment. The patient's elevated creatinine level and history of diabetic nephropathy increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting are also consistent with lactic acidosis.

The other options are less likely to be the cause of the patient's laboratory derangements:

A. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat genital herpes, but it is not typically associated with metabolic acidosis or elevated creatinine levels.

B. Atorvastatin is a statin medication used to treat dyslipidemia, but it is not typically associated with metabolic acidosis or elevated creatinine levels.

C. Insulin is used to treat diabetes, but it would not typically cause metabolic acidosis or elevated creatinine levels.

E. Metoprolol is a beta blocker used to treat hypertension, but it is not typically associated with metabolic acidosis or elevated creatinine levels.

It's worth noting that the patient's symptoms improved after an enema and multiple bowel movements, which suggests that the patient's abdominal pain may have been related to constipation rather than a metabolic derangement.

The lung volumes show a total lung capacity of 110% of predicted value, a residual volume of 115% of predicted value, and a DLCO of 60% of predicted value. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath and weight loss, are consistent with COPD.
* The patient's history of smoking (36-pack-year history) is a significant risk factor for COPD.
* The pulmonary function test (PFT) results support the diagnosis of COPD:
	+ The FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% indicates airflow obstruction, which is a hallmark of COPD.
	+ The FEV1 of 50% of predicted value suggests moderate airflow obstruction.
	+ The lung volumes show a total lung capacity of 110% of predicted value and a residual volume of 115% of predicted value, which is consistent with hyperinflation, a characteristic of COPD.
	+ The DLCO of 60% of predicted value suggests some impairment of gas exchange, but it is not severely reduced, which is consistent with COPD rather than interstitial lung disease.

The other options are less likely based on the patient's symptoms and PFT results:

* A. Asbestosis: While the patient has a history of working in a steel mill, which may have exposed him to asbestos, the PFT results do not suggest restrictive lung disease, which is typical of asbestosis.
* B. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: The patient's BMI is 31 kg/m2, which is obese, but the PFT results do not suggest hypoventilation, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with COPD.
* C. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: The PFT results do not suggest restrictive lung disease, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with COPD.
* D. Bronchiectasis: While the patient's symptoms could be consistent with bronchiectasis, the PFT results do not suggest the characteristic pattern of airflow obstruction and hyperinflation seen in COPD.

According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines, a diagnosis of COPD can be made based on a combination of symptoms, medical history, and spirometry results showing airflow obstruction.",Success
"A 25-year-old zookeeper presents to the office complaining of a dry cough, fever, and chills for the past month. He states that the symptoms come in episodes at the end of the workday and last a few hours. He also mentions that he is fatigued all the time. His job includes taking care of various types of birds. He is otherwise fine and denies recent travel or trauma. Medical history is unremarkable and he does not take any medications. He does not smoke cigarettes or drinks alcohol. Allergies include peanuts, dust, and pollen. Childhood asthma runs in the family. Chest X-ray reveals diffuse haziness in both lower lung fields. A PPD skin test is negative. What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Avoid exposure to birds.

Here's why:

Based on the patient's symptoms, occupation, and radiological findings, the most likely diagnosis is Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP), also known as Bird Fancier's Lung. HP is an inflammatory lung disease caused by repeated exposure to antigens, in this case, avian proteins.

The patient's symptoms, such as dry cough, fever, chills, and fatigue, are consistent with HP. The episodic nature of the symptoms, occurring at the end of the workday, suggests an occupational exposure. The chest X-ray findings of diffuse haziness in both lower lung fields support this diagnosis.

The PPD skin test is negative, which rules out tuberculosis. The patient's allergies to peanuts, dust, and pollen, as well as the family history of childhood asthma, are not directly related to the current symptoms.

Avoiding exposure to birds (option C) is the most appropriate treatment for this patient. This may involve removing the patient from their current job or taking measures to reduce exposure to avian antigens, such as wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) or improving ventilation in the work environment.

Thoracocentesis (option A) is not indicated, as there is no evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Inhaled beclomethasone (option B) may be used to manage symptoms, but it is not a definitive treatment for HP. Isoniazid (option D) is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis, which has been ruled out by the negative PPD skin test. Reassurance (option E) is not sufficient, as the patient requires specific treatment and management to prevent further exposure and disease progression.",Success
"A 60-year-old female presents to her gynecologist with vaginal bleeding. She underwent menopause ten years prior. She has a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. On physical examination, her uterus is uniformly enlarged. Ultrasound reveals a thickened endometrial stripe and tissue biopsy reveals neoplastic endometrial cells. A workup for metastatic disease is negative and the gynecologist recommends a laparoscopic hysterectomy. During the procedure, the surgeon ligates multiple vessels in order to remove the entire uterus. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient develops left-sided flank pain and oliguria. Serum creatinine is found to be 1.4 mg/dl whereas it was 1.0 mg/dl prior to the operation. Renal ultrasound is normal. Urinalysis is notable for hematuria. Ligation of which of the following vessels most likely contributed to this patient’s condition?",D,"The correct answer is B. Ovarian artery.

Here's why:

The patient developed left-sided flank pain and oliguria after the laparoscopic hysterectomy, suggesting a possible injury to the left ureter. The urinalysis result showing hematuria supports this suspicion. The renal ultrasound was normal, which rules out any intrinsic kidney damage.

During a hysterectomy, the surgeon ligates multiple vessels to remove the uterus. The ovarian artery is a possible culprit in this scenario because it is a common site for ureteral injury during hysterectomy. The ovarian artery is located near the ureter and can be inadvertently ligated or injured during the procedure, leading to ureteral obstruction and subsequent renal damage.

The other options are less likely to contribute to this patient's condition:

A. Artery of Sampson: This artery supplies the fallopian tube and is not typically involved in ureteral injury.

C. Superior vesical artery: This artery supplies the bladder and is not directly related to the ureter.

D. Uterine artery: While the uterine artery is ligated during a hysterectomy, it is not typically associated with ureteral injury.

E. Inferior vesical artery: This artery supplies the bladder and urethra, but is not commonly involved in ureteral injury during hysterectomy.

It's essential to note that ureteral injury is a known complication of hysterectomy, and surgeons take precautions to avoid it. However, in this scenario, ligation of the ovarian artery is the most likely cause of the patient's condition.",Success
"A 40-year-old man presents to the physician with progressive weight loss for the last 3 months. He also says he frequently sweats profusely at night and has a recurring low-grade fever, for which he takes acetaminophen. The patient denies any symptoms like cough, breathlessness, or gastrointestinal symptoms. His temperature is 37.1ºC  (98.8ºF), pulse is 76/min, blood pressure is 116/78 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 13/min. On physical examination, he has generalized pallor. Bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy is present. Examination of his abdomen reveals non-tender hepatosplenomegaly in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory evaluation confirms the diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Which of the following viral infections is most likely to have played a role in the pathogenesis of this patient’s malignancy?",B,"The correct answer is B. Epstein-Barr virus.

Hodgkin's lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the immune system, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been implicated as a potential causative agent in its pathogenesis. EBV is a member of the herpesvirus family and is commonly found in the human population. It is known to infect B cells, which are a type of immune cell, and can lead to the development of lymphoma.

Studies have shown that EBV is present in the malignant cells of approximately 40-50% of Hodgkin's lymphoma cases, particularly in the mixed cellularity subtype. The virus is thought to contribute to the development of lymphoma by infecting B cells and promoting their proliferation and survival.

The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's lymphoma:

A. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common viral infection that can cause a range of symptoms, but it is not typically associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma.

C. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that can cause adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, but it is not typically associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma.

D. Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, a type of cancer that occurs in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS.

E. Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is associated with certain types of cancer, including cervical and oropharyngeal cancer, but it is not typically associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Therefore, based on the available evidence, Epstein-Barr virus is the most likely viral infection to have played a role in the pathogenesis of this patient's Hodgkin's lymphoma.",Success
"A 28-year-old gravida 1 at 32 weeks gestation is evaluated for an abnormal ultrasound that showed fetal microcephaly. Early in the 1st trimester, she had fevers and headaches for 1 week. She also experienced myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash. The symptoms resolved without any medications. A week prior to her symptoms, she had traveled to Brazil where she spent most of the evenings hiking. She did not use any mosquito repellents. There is no personal or family history of chronic or congenital diseases. Medications include iron supplementation and a multivitamin. She received all of the recommended childhood vaccinations. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. The IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis were negative. Which of the following is the most likely etiologic agent?",E,"The correct answer is E. Zika virus.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash, are consistent with a viral infection. The fact that she traveled to Brazil, where Zika virus is endemic, and did not use mosquito repellents, increases the likelihood of Zika virus exposure.

Fetal microcephaly is a well-known complication of Zika virus infection during pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have established a strong link between Zika virus infection and microcephaly.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

A. Dengue virus: While dengue fever can cause similar symptoms, it is not typically associated with microcephaly or congenital anomalies.

B. Bartonella henselae: This bacterium is the causative agent of cat-scratch disease, which is not typically associated with the described symptoms or microcephaly.

C. Rubella virus: Rubella infection during pregnancy can cause congenital rubella syndrome, which may include microcephaly. However, the patient's symptoms do not match the typical presentation of rubella, and she reported receiving all recommended childhood vaccinations, including the MMR vaccine, which protects against rubella.

D. Toxoplasmosis: The patient's IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis were negative, making it unlikely that toxoplasmosis is the cause of the microcephaly.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms, travel history, and the presence of fetal microcephaly, Zika virus is the most likely etiologic agent.",Success
"A 41-year-old G3P1 woman presents with a sudden onset throbbing headache, tinnitus, nausea, and left-sided weakness. Patient has no significant past medical history and takes no medications.  Her last two pregnancies ended with spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation. No significant family history. Her vital signs include: blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg, pulse 58/min, respiratory rate 11/min, and temperature 36.8℃ (98.2℉). GCS is 14/15. Physical examination shows 3+ deep tendon reflexes and increased muscle tone in the left upper and lower extremities. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Platelet count 230,000/mm3
Fibrinogen 3.5 g/L
Activated partial thromboplastin time  70 s
Thrombin time 34 s
 A non-contrast CT of the head is performed and shown in the picture. Which of the following would be the next best diagnostic step in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Mixing study.

Here's why:

The patient presents with a sudden onset of symptoms, including a throbbing headache, tinnitus, nausea, and left-sided weakness, which suggests a possible cerebral ischemic event. The physical examination reveals increased muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes on the left side, consistent with a focal neurological deficit. The non-contrast CT of the head shows a hyperdense lesion in the right posterior cerebral artery territory, suggesting a possible cerebral infarction.

The laboratory findings are significant for a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 70 seconds, which is longer than the normal range. This suggests a possible coagulopathy or inhibitor affecting the intrinsic pathway of coagulation.

Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the next best diagnostic step would be to perform a mixing study to evaluate for the presence of a coagulation inhibitor, such as lupus anticoagulant. A mixing study involves mixing the patient's plasma with normal plasma and measuring the aPTT. If the aPTT corrects to normal, it suggests a coagulation factor deficiency. However, if the aPTT remains prolonged, it suggests the presence of a coagulation inhibitor.

The other options are not the next best diagnostic steps for the following reasons:

B. INR (International Normalized Ratio) is used to monitor warfarin therapy and is not relevant in this scenario.

C. D-dimer is a test used to diagnose venous thromboembolism, which is not the primary concern in this patient.

D. Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation test is used to diagnose platelet function disorders, such as von Willebrand disease, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms or laboratory findings.

E. Clot retraction study is used to evaluate platelet function and is not relevant in this scenario.

"A obstetrician is working in a developing country to help promote maternal health and fetal well being. While there, he delivers a baby who he suspects has congenital hypothyroidism, most likely caused by inadequate maternal iodine intake. Which of the following signs and symptoms would NOT be expected to be observed in this child?",B,"The correct answer is B. Diarrhea.

Congenital hypothyroidism, particularly due to maternal iodine deficiency, typically presents with a range of signs and symptoms. These may include:

* Hypotonia (A): Newborns with congenital hypothyroidism often exhibit hypotonia, or low muscle tone, which can manifest as floppiness or lethargy.
* Umbilical hernia (C): Congenital hypothyroidism is associated with an increased risk of umbilical hernia, which is a protrusion of the intestine or other tissue through the belly button.
* Mild jaundice (D): Jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and eyes, is a common finding in newborns with congenital hypothyroidism, particularly if the condition is untreated or undertreated.
* Macroglossia (E): Macroglossia, or an enlarged tongue, is another characteristic feature of congenital hypothyroidism.

However, diarrhea is not typically associated with congenital hypothyroidism. In fact, constipation is a more common gastrointestinal symptom in these patients, likely due to the decreased metabolic rate and slowed gut motility.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines for congenital hypothyroidism do not mention diarrhea as a common symptom of the condition. Therefore, option B, diarrhea, is the correct answer.",Success
"A 33-year-old nurse is referred to an infectious disease specialist after she exhibited a PPD skin test with 17 mm of induration. She denies any cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, weight loss, fatigue, fevers, or night sweats over the last several months. Her temperature is 97.0°F (36.1°C), blood pressure is 120/81 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. An initial chest radiograph is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Isoniazid.

Here's why:

The patient has a positive PPD skin test with 17 mm of induration, which indicates latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, a positive PPD skin test is defined as ≥10 mm of induration in individuals with no prior Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, and ≥15 mm of induration in individuals with prior BCG vaccination. Since the patient is a healthcare worker, she is considered to be at high risk for TB exposure, and a positive PPD skin test in this population is defined as ≥10 mm of induration.

Given the patient's positive PPD skin test and lack of symptoms, the most appropriate management is to initiate treatment for LTBI. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend isoniazid (INH) therapy for 9 months as the preferred regimen for treating LTBI in adults.

Option B is incorrect because the patient requires management for LTBI to prevent the development of active TB.

Option C is incorrect because Quantiferon Gold is an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) used to diagnose TB infection, but it is not a treatment option.

Option D is incorrect because repeating the PPD skin test in 1 week is not necessary, as the patient has already had a positive test result.

Option E is incorrect because the combination of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol is a treatment regimen for active TB, not LTBI.

In summary, the patient requires treatment for LTBI, and isoniazid therapy for 9 months is the most appropriate management option.",Success
"An 81-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room by her son after witnessing the patient fall and hit her head. The son reports that the patient was in her usual state of health until she complained of chest palpitations. This startled her while she was climbing down the stairs and lead to a fall. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Medications are lisinopril, metoprolol, and warfarin. Temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 152/96 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 12/min, and pulse oximetry is 98% on room air. On physical examination, she is disoriented and at times difficult to arouse, the left pupil is 6 mm and non-reactive to light, and the right pupil is 2 mm and reactive to light. A right-sided visual field defect is appreciated on visual field testing. There is 1/5 strength on the right upper and lower extremity; as well as 5/5 strength in the left upper and lower extremity. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head is shown. Which of the following most likely explains this patient’s symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Herniation of the uncus.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a left-sided posterior fossa lesion, specifically a left-sided subdural hematoma (SDH) as seen on the CT scan. The patient's atrial fibrillation and warfarin use increase her risk of bleeding.

The key findings that point to herniation of the uncus are:

1. **Pupillary asymmetry**: The left pupil is 6 mm and non-reactive to light, indicating compression of the left oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) by the herniating uncus.
2. **Right-sided visual field defect**: This is consistent with compression of the left posterior cerebral artery, which supplies the visual cortex.
3. **Hemiparesis**: The patient has 1/5 strength on the right upper and lower extremities, indicating compression of the left cerebral peduncle or corticospinal tract.

Herniation of the uncus, also known as uncal herniation, occurs when the medial aspect of the temporal lobe (uncus) herniates through the tentorial notch, compressing the brainstem and cranial nerves. This can cause the characteristic pupillary asymmetry, visual field defects, and hemiparesis seen in this patient.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

B. Herniation of the cingulate gyrus is not consistent with the patient's pupillary asymmetry and visual field defect.

C. Occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery would not cause the pupillary asymmetry and visual field defect seen in this patient.

D. Occlusion of the basilar artery would cause a more extensive brainstem syndrome, which is not seen in this patient.

E. Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery would not cause the pupillary asymmetry, visual field defect, and hemiparesis seen in this patient.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with herniation of the uncus, likely due to a left-sided subdural hematoma.",Success
"A 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after the results of serum protein electrophoresis showed monoclonal gammopathy. A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Which of the following best describes this class of immune cells?",D,"The correct answer is D. Natural killer cells.

Here's why:

The scenario describes a patient with monoclonal gammopathy, which is a condition characterized by the presence of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow. The bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells, which is a relatively low percentage. The fact that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells suggests that they may be able to evade immune surveillance.

Natural killer (NK) cells are a type of immune cell that can recognize and lyse abnormal cells, including tumor cells and virally infected cells, without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. They do this through the recognition of certain surface molecules, including the absence of class I major histocompatibility molecules. This is known as ""missing-self"" recognition.

NK cells are important in preventing the proliferation of abnormal cells, including cancer cells and virally infected cells. In this scenario, the NK cells would normally recognize the monoclonal plasma cells as abnormal due to the downregulation of class I major histocompatibility molecules and eliminate them.

The other options are not correct because:

A. CD8+ T lymphocytes require priming and activation by antigen-presenting cells before they can recognize and lyse target cells.

B. Bone marrow-derived macrophages are involved in phagocytosis and antigen presentation, but they do not have the same ability to recognize and lyse abnormal cells as NK cells.

C. CD4+ T lymphocytes are involved in helper functions and activation of other immune cells, but they do not have direct cytotoxic activity against abnormal cells.

E. Band neutrophils are a type of immature neutrophil that is not involved in immune surveillance or recognition of abnormal cells.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Natural killer cells.",Success

Serum
Creatine kinase 212 U/L
Lactate dehydrogenase 164 U/L
AST 34 U/L
ALT 35 U/L
Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""",A,"The correct answer is C. Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy.

The patient's symptoms, such as progressive muscle weakness in the shoulders and hips, difficulty with swallowing solid foods, and laboratory results showing elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, suggest a diagnosis of polymyositis, an inflammatory muscle disease.

Option C, perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy, is a characteristic histopathological feature of polymyositis. This finding would confirm the diagnosis of polymyositis.

Option A, intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy, is more consistent with a diagnosis of neurogenic disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Option B, inflammation of synovial spaces on ultrasound, is not a characteristic feature of polymyositis.

Option D, positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies, is more consistent with a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction.

Option E, dystrophin gene mutation on genetic analysis, is associated with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, a genetic disorder that affects muscle function. While the patient's family history is notable for a maternal uncle with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest this diagnosis.

Therefore, option C is the most likely to confirm the diagnosis of polymyositis.",Success

Cranial nerve exam is notable for fixed pupillary dilation, and difficulty depressing both eyes. The remainder of his exam is normal. Which of the following is the pathogenesis of this patient’s presentation?",A,"The correct answer is A. Decreased acetylcholine release.

The patient's symptoms, including sudden onset of blurry vision, diplopia (seeing double), and fixed pupillary dilation, suggest a diagnosis of botulism. The history of eating food from a picnic, particularly homemade pickles, increases the suspicion of botulism. Botulinum toxin, produced by Clostridium botulinum, is a potent neurotoxin that inhibits the release of acetylcholine from nerve terminals. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in neuromuscular transmission and autonomic nervous system function.

The inhibition of acetylcholine release leads to a range of symptoms, including:

* Blurred vision and diplopia due to impaired neuromuscular transmission in the extraocular muscles
* Fixed pupillary dilation due to impaired parasympathetic innervation of the iris
* Difficulty swallowing and speaking due to impaired neuromuscular transmission in the bulbar muscles
* Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, due to impaired autonomic nervous system function

The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of botulism:

* B. Overactivation of adenylate cyclase is associated with cholera toxin, which causes a different type of foodborne illness.
* C. Release of interferon-gamma is associated with immune responses, not botulism.
* D. Degradation of phospholipids is not a known mechanism of botulism.
* E. Inhibition of GABA release is associated with certain neurological disorders, but not botulism.

It's essential to note that botulism is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment with antitoxin and supportive care.",Success

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Biliary atresia.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as increasing jaundice, pale stools, and elevated direct bilirubin, suggest a diagnosis of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is typically caused by a liver or biliary tract disorder.

The laboratory results support this diagnosis:

* Elevated direct bilirubin (12.3 mg/dL) indicates conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
* Alkaline phosphatase is significantly elevated (2007 U/L), which is consistent with a biliary tract disorder.
* γ-Glutamyl transferase (154 U/L) is also elevated, which further supports a biliary tract disorder.
* AST and ALT are mildly elevated, but not significantly, which suggests that the liver parenchyma is not severely damaged.

Given the patient's age, symptoms, and laboratory results, biliary atresia is the most likely diagnosis. Biliary atresia is a congenital disorder characterized by the absence or obstruction of the extrahepatic bile ducts, leading to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, jaundice, and pale stools.

The other options can be ruled out:

* A. Galactosemia is a metabolic disorder that typically presents with vomiting, diarrhea, and liver dysfunction in the first few weeks of life. The laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.
* C. Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects bilirubin metabolism, but it typically presents with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, not conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
* D. Breast milk jaundice is a common condition that affects breastfed infants, but it typically presents with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and resolves with breastfeeding cessation or supplementation with formula. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.
* E. Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects bilirubin excretion, but it typically presents with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and a characteristic black pigment in the liver. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.

"A 43-year-old man comes to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and progressive perioral numbness for the past 24 hours. 3 days ago, he underwent a total thyroidectomy for treatment of papillary thyroid cancer. His only medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes a spasm in the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck. Which of the following ECG findings are most likely in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. QT prolongation.

The patient's symptoms, particularly perioral numbness, muscle spasms, and fatigue, are suggestive of hypocalcemia (low calcium levels). This is a common complication of total thyroidectomy, as the parathyroid glands, which regulate calcium levels, may be inadvertently damaged or removed during the surgery.

Hypocalcemia can cause a range of ECG changes, including QT prolongation. This is because calcium plays a crucial role in the regulation of cardiac ion channels and the repolarization of the cardiac action potential. When calcium levels are low, the QT interval may become prolonged, increasing the risk of arrhythmias.

The other options are not directly related to hypocalcemia or the patient's symptoms:

A. Torsade de pointes is a type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that can occur in the setting of QT prolongation, but it is not a primary ECG finding in this scenario.

C. U waves are typically seen in hypokalemia (low potassium levels), not hypocalcemia.

D. Peaked T waves are more commonly associated with hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), not hypocalcemia.

E. PR prolongation is not a typical ECG finding in hypocalcemia.

It's essential to note that the patient's symptoms and ECG findings should prompt further evaluation, including laboratory tests to confirm hypocalcemia and guide treatment.",Success

Lymphocytes 11%
Monocytes 0%
Platelet count 380,000/mm³
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Diverticulitis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as left lower quadrant pain that worsens with defecation, are consistent with diverticulitis. The ""crampy"" nature of the pain also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's age (68 years old) and history of mild constipation for several years increase the likelihood of diverticulitis.

The laboratory results also support this diagnosis. The elevated white blood cell count (16,000/mm³) with a predominance of neutrophils (89%) suggests an inflammatory response, which is consistent with diverticulitis. The presence of bands (5%) also indicates an acute inflammatory response.

While adenocarcinoma of the colon (option C) is a possibility, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are more consistent with an inflammatory process like diverticulitis rather than a malignant process.

Hypothyroidism (option B) is unlikely given the patient's normal vital signs and lack of symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism.

Chronic inflammatory bowel disease (option D) is also unlikely given the patient's lack of symptoms suggestive of chronic diarrhea, weight loss, or other systemic symptoms.

Irritable bowel syndrome (option E) is possible, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are more consistent with an inflammatory process like diverticulitis rather than a functional disorder like IBS.

According to the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines, the diagnosis of diverticulitis is based on a combination of clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings. The guidelines recommend that patients with suspected diverticulitis undergo imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, to confirm the diagnosis.",Success

He also endorses deep and burning buttock and hip pain when walking, which is relieved by rest. The patient states that he does not have erections at night or in the morning. His past medical history is notable for diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypertension, and he has a 40 pack-year smoking history. Physical exam is notable for weak lower extremity and femoral pulses. Which of the following is the most specific etiology of this patient’s symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Aortoiliac atherosclerosis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms of erectile dysfunction, deep and burning buttock and hip pain when walking (relieved by rest), and weak lower extremity and femoral pulses are highly suggestive of aortoiliac atherosclerosis. This condition is characterized by the buildup of plaque in the aorta and iliac arteries, leading to stenosis or occlusion of these vessels. The symptoms are consistent with Leriche syndrome, a variant of aortoiliac atherosclerosis that affects the distal aorta and iliac arteries, causing erectile dysfunction, buttock and hip pain, and leg claudication.

The other options are not as specific to the patient's symptoms:

A. Anxiety is not a direct cause of erectile dysfunction, although it can contribute to it. The patient's symptoms are more suggestive of a physical rather than psychological etiology.

C. Diabetic neuropathy can cause erectile dysfunction, but it would not typically cause the buttock and hip pain or weak pulses seen in this patient.

D. Spinal stenosis can cause leg pain and weakness, but it would not typically cause erectile dysfunction or weak femoral pulses.

E. Vascular claudication is a symptom of peripheral artery disease, which can cause leg pain with exercise, but it would not typically cause erectile dysfunction or weak femoral pulses.

The patient's risk factors, including smoking history, diabetes, and hypertension, also increase his risk for aortoiliac atherosclerosis.",Success
A 55-year-old man with a history of chronic glomerulonephritis due to IgA nephropathy presents to your office with bone pain. Which of the following laboratory findings would you most expect upon analysis of this patient's serum?,A,"The correct answer is A. Increased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, decreased calcitriol.

Here's why:

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common complication of IgA nephropathy, and it can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. As kidney function declines, the body's ability to excrete phosphate is impaired, leading to hyperphosphatemia (increased phosphate levels). This, in turn, can cause hypocalcemia (decreased calcium levels) as phosphate binds to calcium in the bloodstream.

In response to hypocalcemia, the parathyroid glands produce more parathyroid hormone (PTH) to stimulate calcium release from bones. However, in CKD, the kidneys are also unable to convert vitamin D into its active form, calcitriol, which is necessary for calcium absorption and bone health. As a result, calcitriol levels are often decreased in CKD patients.

Therefore, the expected laboratory findings in this patient would be:

* Increased PTH (in response to hypocalcemia)
* Decreased calcium (due to hyperphosphatemia and impaired calcium absorption)
* Increased phosphate (due to impaired excretion)
* Decreased calcitriol (due to impaired kidney function and vitamin D conversion)

The other options do not accurately reflect the expected laboratory findings in this patient:

* Option B is incorrect because PTH would not be decreased in response to hypocalcemia.
* Option C is incorrect because calcium levels would not be increased in the presence of hyperphosphatemia and impaired calcium absorption.
* Option D is incorrect because PTH would not be decreased in response to hypocalcemia, and calcitriol levels would be decreased, not increased.
* Option E is incorrect because the patient's laboratory findings would not be normal given the presence of CKD and secondary hyperparathyroidism.",Success
"A medical researcher is studying the physiology of the immune system in order to better understand the effects of HIV on patients. He isolates a group of cells that are shown by flow cytometry to be positive for the cell surface marker CD8. He then mixes this cell population with a group of infected cells, crosslinks extracellular interactions, and immunoprecipitates the CD8 protein. He identifies a protein bound to CD8 that is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell. Which of the following best describes the primary function of the protein that was most likely identified?",C,"The correct answer is C. Binds endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel.

Here's why:

The researcher isolated CD8+ cells, which are cytotoxic T cells that play a crucial role in cell-mediated immunity. The CD8 protein is a cell surface marker that helps these cells recognize and bind to infected cells or tumor cells.

By crosslinking extracellular interactions and immunoprecipitating the CD8 protein, the researcher likely identified a protein that interacts with CD8 on the surface of the infected cells. Given the context of HIV infection and the involvement of CD8+ cells, the most likely protein identified is the MHC class I molecule.

MHC class I molecules are composed of two chains (heavy chain and β2-microglobulin) and are expressed on the surface of infected cells. They bind to endogenous peptides that are generated from the proteasomal degradation of viral proteins and are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum by the TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) channel. These peptide-MHC class I complexes are then recognized by CD8+ T cells, which triggers an immune response against the infected cells.

The other options are not directly related to the interaction between CD8+ cells and MHC class I molecules:

A. Complement proteins are involved in the innate immune response and are not directly related to CD8+ cells or MHC class I molecules.

B. Endogenous peptides present in the endosome are more relevant to MHC class II molecules, which are involved in antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells.

D. Exogenous peptides present in the endosome are also more relevant to MHC class II molecules and are not directly related to CD8+ cells or MHC class I molecules.

E. Exogenous peptides transported by the TAP channel are not a valid concept, as the TAP channel is involved in transporting endogenous peptides generated from the proteasomal degradation of viral proteins.",Success
"A 61-year-old Caucasian male presents to your office with chest pain. He states that he is worried about his heart, as his father died at age 62 from a heart attack. He reports that his chest pain worsens with large meals and spicy foods and improves with calcium carbonate. He denies dyspnea on exertion and an ECG is normal. What is the most likely cause of this patient's pain?",D,"The correct answer is D. Gastroesophageal junction incompetence.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as chest pain that worsens with large meals and spicy foods and improves with calcium carbonate, are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The fact that the ECG is normal suggests that the chest pain is not related to cardiac ischemia. The patient's family history of heart disease is a red herring, as the symptoms do not suggest a cardiac origin.

GERD is caused by incompetence of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which allows stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus, causing symptoms. Calcium carbonate, an antacid, would help to neutralize stomach acid and alleviate symptoms, which is consistent with the patient's report.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and presentation:

A. Partially occluded coronary artery would be expected to cause cardiac ischemia, which would likely be accompanied by ECG changes and possibly dyspnea on exertion.

B. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that typically presents with dysphagia, weight loss, and other symptoms not mentioned in the case.

C. Umbilical hernia is a type of abdominal hernia that would not typically cause chest pain.

E. Intestinal metaplasia at the gastroesophageal junction is a precursor to Barrett's esophagus, a condition that increases the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. While it may be associated with GERD, it is not the primary cause of the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and presentation, the most likely cause of his pain is gastroesophageal junction incompetence, or GERD.",Success
"A 36-year-old woman comes to the clinic because of tearing and a foreign body sensation in her eyes bilaterally, which has gradually worsened over the last several weeks. She also notes having occasional palpitations, nervousness, sweating, and heat intolerance. Her past medical history is unremarkable. She reports a 20-pack-year smoking history and is currently a daily smoker. Physical examination shows an anxious, trembling woman. She has eyelid retraction bilaterally, with an inability to fully close her eyes. Her extraocular motility is limited on upgaze. There is no thyromegaly, and no thyroid nodules are noted. Laboratory studies reveal a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.1 μU/mL and total T4 of 42 μg/dL. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin is positive. CT scan of the orbits shows proptosis and marked enlargement of the extraocular muscle with sparing of the tendons. Which of the following would most likely transiently worsen this patient’s eye symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is E. Treatment with radioactive iodine.

This patient is presenting with symptoms of Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism. The laboratory results, including a low TSH level and elevated T4 level, support this diagnosis. The presence of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) further confirms the diagnosis. The eye symptoms, including tearing, foreign body sensation, eyelid retraction, and limited extraocular motility, are consistent with Graves' ophthalmopathy.

Radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment is often used to treat Graves' disease by destroying part of the thyroid gland and reducing hormone production. However, in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy, RAI treatment can transiently worsen eye symptoms in up to 15% of cases. This is thought to be due to the release of inflammatory cytokines and thyroid antigens from the damaged thyroid tissue, which can exacerbate the orbital inflammation.

In contrast, the other options are not likely to worsen the patient's eye symptoms:

A. External orbital radiation is a treatment for Graves' ophthalmopathy that can help reduce inflammation and improve eye symptoms.

B. Selenium supplementation has been shown to improve eye symptoms in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy, possibly by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation.

C. Smoking cessation is important for overall health, but it is not directly related to the worsening of eye symptoms in this patient.

D. Systemic corticosteroids can be used to treat Graves' ophthalmopathy by reducing inflammation and swelling in the orbits. They are often used in conjunction with other treatments, such as orbital radiation or RAI, to manage eye symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is E. Treatment with radioactive iodine.",Success
"A 7-year-old boy is brought to a pediatrician by his parents for evaluation of frequent bed wetting during the night. A detailed history reveals that there has been no history of urinary incontinence during the day since the boy was 4 years of age, but that he has never been dry at night continuously for 1 week. There is no history of urinary tract infections, urgency, frequency, or hesitancy. On physical examination, the boy’s vital signs are stable. His neurologic and abdominal examinations are completely normal. His laboratory investigations are as follows:
Urine-specific gravity (first-morning sample) 1.035
Urine red blood cells Absent
Urine pus cells Absent
Urine culture Negative
Which of the following is the next step in the management of this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Reassuring the parents and use of an enuresis alarm.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms are consistent with nocturnal enuresis, also known as bedwetting. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends a step-wise approach to managing nocturnal enuresis.

Given the patient's normal physical examination, laboratory results, and lack of symptoms suggestive of underlying urinary tract infections or neurological disorders, the next step would be to reassure the parents and initiate behavioral therapy.

Enuresis alarms are a recommended first-line treatment for nocturnal enuresis. These alarms detect moisture and alert the child to wake up and use the bathroom, helping to train the child to respond to the sensation of a full bladder during sleep.

Options A and B are not indicated at this stage, as there is no evidence to suggest any underlying anatomical or structural abnormalities. Ultrasonography or MRI may be considered if there are signs of underlying urinary tract abnormalities or neurological disorders, which are not present in this case.

Options D and E are pharmacological interventions that may be considered if behavioral therapy is unsuccessful. Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic medication that can help reduce bladder contractions, while imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that has been used off-label to treat nocturnal enuresis. However, these medications are not recommended as first-line treatments and may have potential side effects.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Reassuring the parents and use of an enuresis alarm, which is a recommended initial approach to managing nocturnal enuresis in this patient.",Success
"A 52-year-old man with a history of gastric cancer that was treated with subtotal gastrectomy dies in a motor vehicle collision. At autopsy, examination of the spinal cord shows unilateral atrophy of the neurons in the area indicated by the arrow. Neurological examination of the patient when he was still alive would most likely have shown which of the following findings?",D,"The correct answer is E. Decreased sense of crude touch in the contralateral arm.

The arrow in the image points to the posterior horn of the spinal cord, which is responsible for processing sensory information from the body. Unilateral atrophy of the neurons in this area would affect the transmission of sensory signals from the contralateral side of the body.

Crude touch, also known as proprioception, is a type of sensory information that is transmitted through the posterior columns of the spinal cord. Since the atrophy is unilateral, it would affect the contralateral side of the body, resulting in decreased sense of crude touch in the contralateral arm.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Decreased sense of temperature in the ipsilateral arm: Temperature sensation is transmitted through the spinothalamic tract, which is located in the anterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord, not the posterior horn.

B. Decreased strength of the contralateral leg: Motor function is controlled by the anterior horn cells, not the posterior horn cells. Atrophy of the posterior horn cells would not affect motor strength.

C. Decreased vibratory sense in the ipsilateral arm: Vibratory sense is transmitted through the posterior columns, but since the atrophy is unilateral, it would affect the contralateral side, not the ipsilateral side.

D. Decreased positional sense in the ipsilateral leg: Positional sense, also known as proprioception, is transmitted through the posterior columns, but again, the atrophy would affect the contralateral side, not the ipsilateral side.

It's essential to understand the anatomy and function of the spinal cord to correctly answer this question. The posterior horn is responsible for processing sensory information, and unilateral atrophy would affect the contralateral side of the body.",Success
"A 24-year-old pregnant woman at 28 weeks gestation presents to the emergency department with complaints of fever with chills and pain in her knee and ankle joints for the past 2 days. She also complains of headaches and difficulty moving her neck. Further questioning reveals that she had a tick bite on her arm while gardening a few days ago. Past medical history is noncontributory. She takes a multivitamin with iron and folate every day and has been receiving regular prenatal care and the pregnancy is progressing normally. On examination, an erythematous rash is seen on her right arm, as shown in the accompanying photograph. Her obstetric examination is normal. Ultrasound of the fetus is reassuring with a normal heartbeat and no gross abnormalities. A specimen is collected to test for Lyme disease. What is the next best step for this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Amoxicillin.

This patient's symptoms, including fever, chills, joint pain, headache, and difficulty moving her neck, are consistent with early Lyme disease. The erythematous rash on her right arm, which is likely a bull's-eye rash (erythema migrans), further supports this diagnosis. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis).

In pregnant women, the treatment of choice for Lyme disease is amoxicillin, which is effective against B. burgdorferi and is safe for use during pregnancy. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends amoxicillin 500 mg orally three times a day for 2-4 weeks for the treatment of early Lyme disease in pregnant women.

Doxycycline (option B) is not recommended during pregnancy due to its potential to cause fetal harm. Tetracycline (option C) is also not recommended during pregnancy due to its ability to cause tooth discoloration and inhibit bone growth in the fetus. Gentamicin (option E) is not effective against B. burgdorferi and is not recommended for the treatment of Lyme disease. Ibuprofen (option A) may be used to manage symptoms such as fever and joint pain, but it is not an effective treatment for Lyme disease.

It is essential to note that the patient should also receive prenatal care and monitoring to ensure the health and well-being of the fetus.",Success
"A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with a four month history of fatigue and weakness. The weakness has been progressive to the point where she cannot climb stairs and stand from a sitting position. She has only had one menstrual period in the last four months and has never been pregnant. She smokes a pack of cigarettes every day and does not take any medications. Her temperature is 98°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 15/min. She is obese with a significant pannus. Abdominal striae are present. Her laboratory workup is notable for the following:

Serum:
Na+: 142 mEq/L
Cl-: 102 mEq/L
K+: 3.9 mEq/L
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 314 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.1 mg/dL
AST: 9 U/L

24-hour urinary cortisol: 470 µg (< 300 µg)
Serum cortisol 30 µg/mL (5-23 µg/dL)
Serum adrenocorticotropin-releasing hormone (ACTH) 2 pg/mL (> 5 pg/mL)

A 48-hour high dose dexamethasone suppression trial shows that her serum cortisol levels do not decrease. What is the best next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is C. MRI of the pituitary gland.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, and oligomenorrhea, are consistent with Cushing's syndrome, which is a hormonal disorder caused by excessive levels of cortisol in the body. The laboratory results support this diagnosis, with elevated serum cortisol levels, high 24-hour urinary cortisol, and a lack of suppression of cortisol levels in response to the high-dose dexamethasone suppression trial.

The low ACTH level (< 5 pg/mL) suggests that the source of the excessive cortisol production is not from an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma (Cushing's disease). Instead, it points towards an adrenal source, such as an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma.

However, the lack of suppression of cortisol levels in response to the high-dose dexamethasone suppression trial suggests that the cortisol production is not regulated by the normal negative feedback mechanism, which is typically seen in adrenal adenomas. This finding is more consistent with an ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome, such as an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma.

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the next step in management would be to evaluate the pituitary gland to rule out a pituitary source of ACTH production, which would be an ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome. An MRI of the pituitary gland would be the most appropriate next step.

Option A, MRI of the adrenal glands, may be useful in evaluating adrenal anatomy, but it would not provide information about the pituitary gland.

Option B, MRI of the chest, is not relevant to the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome.

Option D, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test, is not necessary, as the high-dose dexamethasone suppression trial has already been performed.

Option E, inferior petrosal sinus sampling, is a procedure used to diagnose Cushing's disease by measuring ACTH levels in the petrosal sinuses, which drain the pituitary gland. While it may be useful in certain cases, it is not the next step in management for this patient, given the low ACTH level and lack of suppression of cortisol levels in response to the high-dose dexamethasone suppression trial.",Success
A 67-year-woman with non-Hodgkin lymphoma comes to the physician because of progressively increasing numbness and tingling in her fingers and toes. Her last cycle of chemotherapy with vincristine was 1 week ago. Physical examination shows decreased sensation to light touch in all distal extremities. Knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes are decreased. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s peripheral neuropathy?,A,"The correct answer is A. Inhibition of beta-tubulin polymerization.

Vincristine, a vinca alkaloid, is a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma. One of its well-known side effects is peripheral neuropathy, which is characterized by numbness, tingling, and decreased sensation in the distal extremities, as well as decreased deep tendon reflexes.

The underlying mechanism of vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy is the inhibition of beta-tubulin polymerization. Vincristine binds to tubulin, a protein that forms microtubules, which are essential for the structure and function of neurons. By inhibiting beta-tubulin polymerization, vincristine disrupts the formation of microtubules, leading to axonal degeneration and damage to the peripheral nerves. This results in the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, such as numbness, tingling, and decreased sensation.

The other options are not directly related to vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy:

B. Creation of free radicals that unwind DNA is a mechanism associated with anthracycline chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin.

C. Inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase is a mechanism associated with methotrexate, a chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits folate metabolism.

D. Formation of cross-links between strands of DNA is a mechanism associated with alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide.

E. Incorporation of false pyrimidine analogues into DNA is a mechanism associated with antimetabolite chemotherapy, such as 5-fluorouracil.

Therefore, option A, inhibition of beta-tubulin polymerization, is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's peripheral neuropathy.",Success
A 68-year-old man comes to the physician with a 1-week history of painless hematuria. A CT scan of the urinary tract shows areas of bladder wall thickening. Cystoscopy shows several sessile masses with central necrosis arising from the bladder wall. A biopsy specimen of the bladder masses shows moderately differentiated urothelial cells with abundant mitotic figures and nuclear atypia. The patient most likely has a history of exposure to which of the following?,B,"The correct answer is B. Aromatic amines.

The patient's symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with bladder cancer, specifically urothelial carcinoma. The presence of moderately differentiated urothelial cells with abundant mitotic figures and nuclear atypia suggests a malignant tumor.

Aromatic amines, such as benzidine and beta-naphthylamine, are known to be carcinogenic and have been linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer. These chemicals were commonly used in the dye and rubber industries, and exposure to them has been associated with a higher incidence of bladder cancer.

The other options are not directly related to the development of bladder cancer:

A. Ionizing radiation is a risk factor for various types of cancer, but it is not specifically associated with bladder cancer.

C. Aflatoxins are a type of mycotoxin produced by certain fungi and are known to be carcinogenic, but they are primarily associated with liver cancer.

D. Vinyl chloride is a known carcinogen, but it is primarily associated with liver cancer and angiosarcoma, not bladder cancer.

E. Radon is a radioactive gas that can accumulate in buildings and is a risk factor for lung cancer, not bladder cancer.

The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute both recognize aromatic amines as a risk factor for bladder cancer, supporting the correct answer as option B.",Success
"A 14-year-old girl comes to the physician with her father for evaluation of her short stature. She feels well overall, but is concerned because all of her friends are taller than her. Her birth weight was normal. Her father reports he had a short stature during his teenage years; he is currently 177 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall. She is at the 2ndpercentile for height and 35th percentile for weight. Breast development is Tanner stage 2. Pubic and axillary hair is absent. An x-ray of the left hand and wrist shows a bone age of 11 years. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Reassurance and follow-up.

Here's why:

The patient is a 14-year-old girl who is concerned about her short stature. She is at the 2nd percentile for height, but her weight is at the 35th percentile, indicating that she is proportionally small. Her father had a short stature during his teenage years, but he is currently 5 ft 10 in tall, suggesting that he may have had a constitutional delay in growth and development.

The patient's physical examination reveals breast development at Tanner stage 2, indicating that she is in early puberty. The absence of pubic and axillary hair suggests that she may have a delay in adrenarche (the onset of adrenal androgen production). The bone age of 11 years, as determined by an x-ray of the left hand and wrist, is consistent with a delay in skeletal maturation.

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most appropriate next step in management is reassurance and follow-up. Constitutional delay in growth and development is a common cause of short stature in adolescents, and it is often a benign condition that resolves on its own with time. The patient's bone age and pubertal development are consistent with this diagnosis.

The other options are not indicated at this time:

A. Genetic karyotyping is not necessary, as there is no indication of a chromosomal abnormality.

B. Pelvic ultrasound is not relevant to the patient's short stature.

C. Measuring serum dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels may be useful in evaluating adrenal function, but it is not necessary in this case, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with constitutional delay in growth and development.

E. MRI of the brain is not indicated, as there is no suspicion of a central nervous system abnormality.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with constitutional delay in growth and development, and the most appropriate next step in management is reassurance and follow-up.",Success

A renal biopsy of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?""",D,"The correct answer is D. Normal light microscopy findings.

This patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by proteinuria (excess protein in the urine), edema, and hypoalbuminemia (low albumin levels). The patient's urine dipstick shows 4+ protein, indicating significant proteinuria. The serum albumin level is low at 2.1 g/dL, and the patient has pitting edema in the upper and lower extremities, as well as periorbital edema.

In nephrotic syndrome, the renal biopsy often shows minimal changes on light microscopy, which is why option D is the correct answer. The glomeruli may appear normal or show minimal mesangial proliferation, but the characteristic feature is the effacement of foot processes of podocytes on electron microscopy (option E). This is a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome, particularly in minimal change disease, which is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children.

Option A, mesangial proliferation on light microscopy, is more characteristic of mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, such as IgA nephropathy. Option B, subepithelial dense deposits on electron microscopy, is seen in post-infectious glomerulonephritis. Option C, deposits of IgG and C3 at the glomerular basement membrane on immunofluorescence, is seen in immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, such as lupus nephritis.",Success

Physical examination reveals confluent scaly patches, plaques, and generalized erythroderma along the torso and lower extremities (see image). There is also a solid skin lesion with a diameter greater than 1 cm. The dermatologist suspects a malignancy and orders a biopsy. Which of the following is the most accurate description of this condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Tumor arising from cutaneous T cells.

The image and physical examination findings described in the question are consistent with Sézary syndrome, a rare and aggressive form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). CTCL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the skin and is characterized by the proliferation of malignant T cells in the skin.

The other options are not accurate descriptions of the condition:

A. Vascular tumor containing spindle cells: This description is more consistent with a diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma, a type of cancer that affects the blood vessels.

B. Tumor arising from the folliculosebaceous–apocrine germ: This description is more consistent with a diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma, a type of skin cancer that arises from the sebaceous glands.

C. Tumor arising from melanocytes: This description is more consistent with a diagnosis of melanoma, a type of skin cancer that arises from the pigment-producing cells called melanocytes.

E. Tumor arising from epidermal keratinocytes: This description is more consistent with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer that arises from the keratinocytes in the epidermis.

The diagnosis of Sézary syndrome is typically made through a combination of clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, and histopathological examination of a skin biopsy. The presence of a solid skin lesion with a diameter greater than 1 cm, along with the confluent scaly patches, plaques, and generalized erythroderma, is consistent with the clinical presentation of Sézary syndrome.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because she has been feeling very stressed over the past several months. During this period, she has found it difficult to relax. She states that her head is full of worries. She works at an accountant's office and reports difficulty in concentrating on her work. She has been working longer shifts because one of her coworkers is on vacation and reports feeling more tired than usual. She is married and frequently fights with her husband. The patient states that in order to deal with her stress, she goes shopping. While shopping, she steals small trivial items and feels immediately relieved thereafter. She discards the objects she steals and has feelings of shame and guilt about her actions. Her husband is concerned about her behavior, but she is unable to stop shoplifting. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person, place, and time. She reports feeling anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Cognitive behavioral therapy.

This patient's symptoms are consistent with kleptomania, a psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal objects that are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value. The patient experiences a sense of tension or anxiety before committing the theft, and a sense of relief or gratification after the act.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to their symptoms. In the case of kleptomania, CBT can help the patient identify triggers for their shoplifting behavior, develop coping skills to manage stress and anxiety, and learn alternative behaviors to replace the maladaptive behavior of shoplifting.

While interpersonal therapy (Option B) may be helpful in addressing relationship issues, it is not specifically targeted at treating kleptomania. Psychodynamic psychotherapy (Option C) may also be helpful in exploring underlying emotional conflicts, but it is not as focused on changing specific behaviors as CBT.

Motivational interviewing (Option E) is a technique used to help individuals resolve ambivalence about changing their behavior, but it is not a comprehensive treatment approach for kleptomania.

Lithium (Option A) is a medication typically used to treat bipolar disorder, which is not indicated in this patient's presentation.

His temperature is 98.1°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 162/103 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an elderly man who laughs inappropriately at times and who is a poor historian. When he is engaged in conversation, he exhibits word finding difficulty and is rather inattentive. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Frontotemporal dementia.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, particularly the early onset of behavioral changes, such as using foul language and grabbing people unexpectedly, are characteristic of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). FTD is a group of disorders that affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, leading to changes in personality, behavior, and language.

The patient's presentation, including:

* Inappropriate behavior
* Word-finding difficulty
* Inattention
* Poor historian
* Inappropriate laughter

are all consistent with FTD. The progression of symptoms from behavioral changes to memory impairment and difficulty with self-care also supports this diagnosis.

* Kluver-Bucy syndrome (C) is a rare condition that results from bilateral temporal lobe damage, characterized by hypersexuality, hypermetamorphosis (excessive interest in novelty), and other distinct features not seen in this patient.
* Lewy body dementia (D) often presents with fluctuating cognitive impairment, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonian symptoms, which are not prominent in this patient's presentation.
* Vascular dementia (E) is typically associated with a history of cerebrovascular disease, and the patient's symptoms do not suggest a clear vascular component.

"An 11-month-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother for a rash on his trunk, which he has had for the past 2 days. She notes that he is eating less and is more cranky than usual. His birth history is insignificant, and his immunizations are up to date. Vital signs include: temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 98/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. The rash features thin-walled, fluid-filled blisters that rupture easily. Fluid samples from the lesions are sent for analysis to a microbiology lab. The results reveal an infection by the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is diagnosed with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Which of the following is involved with the primary defense in response to the bacteria and toxins produced by this organism?",E,"The correct answer is D. Immunoglobulin- IgA.

Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is a severe skin infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which produces exfoliative toxins that cleave desmoglein 1, leading to epidermal separation and blister formation.

The primary defense against S. aureus and its toxins involves the mucosal immune system, particularly IgA. IgA is the primary immunoglobulin found in mucosal surfaces, including the skin, and plays a crucial role in neutralizing bacterial toxins and preventing their entry into the body. In the case of SSSS, IgA helps to neutralize the exfoliative toxins produced by S. aureus, preventing their binding to skin cells and reducing the severity of the infection.

IgG (Option A) is an important antibody in the secondary immune response, providing long-term immunity against infections. While it may play a role in protecting against S. aureus infections, it is not the primary defense against the toxins produced by this organism.

IgE (Option B) is primarily involved in allergic reactions and is not directly related to the defense against S. aureus or its toxins.

IgD (Option C) is an antibody found on the surface of mature B cells and plays a role in the recognition of antigens. While it may be involved in the initial recognition of S. aureus, it is not the primary defense against the toxins produced by this organism.

IgM (Option E) is the first antibody produced in response to an infection and provides immediate protection. While it may play a role in the early response to S. aureus, it is not the primary defense against the toxins produced by this organism.

Therefore, the correct answer is IgA (Option D), which is the primary immunoglobulin involved in the defense against S. aureus and its toxins in the context of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome.",Success

An x-ray of the chest shows patchy infiltrates in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?""",A,"The correct answer is A. Levofloxacin.

Justification:

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Legionnaires' disease, a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila. The patient's presentation with dry cough, shortness of breath, low-grade fever, and watery diarrhea is consistent with Legionnaires' disease. The laboratory results, including the patient's complete blood count (CBC) and electrolyte panel, do not suggest any other obvious causes of the patient's symptoms.

The chest x-ray showing patchy infiltrates in both lungs further supports the diagnosis of pneumonia.

Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is effective against Legionella pneumophila and is recommended as first-line therapy for Legionnaires' disease by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA).

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Option B) is not typically used to treat Legionnaires' disease. Amoxicillin (Option C) is not effective against Legionella pneumophila. Oseltamivir (Option D) is an antiviral medication used to treat influenza, which is not suspected in this case. Rifampin (Option E) is sometimes used in combination with other antibiotics to treat Legionnaires' disease, but it is not recommended as monotherapy.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, levofloxacin is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy.",Success
"A transvaginal ultrasound shows an intrauterine heteroechoic mass with numerous anechoic spaces and no identifiable fetus or amniotic fluid. Both the ovaries are enlarged and have multiple thin-walled, septated cysts with clear content. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the ovarian findings?",E,"The correct answer is E. Theca lutein cysts.

The ultrasound findings described in the question are consistent with a molar pregnancy, which is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease. The intrauterine heteroechoic mass with numerous anechoic spaces and no identifiable fetus or amniotic fluid suggests a complete hydatidiform mole.

The ovarian findings, specifically the presence of multiple thin-walled, septated cysts with clear content, are characteristic of theca lutein cysts. These cysts are often seen in association with molar pregnancies and are thought to be caused by the high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) produced by the molar tissue. hCG stimulates the ovaries to produce multiple follicles, which can become cystic and enlarged.

The other options are not directly related to the ovarian findings in the context of a molar pregnancy:

A. Chocolate cysts are a type of endometrioma, which is a benign cystic lesion filled with thick, dark fluid. They are not typically associated with molar pregnancies.

B. Corpus luteum cysts are functional cysts that form in the ovaries during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. While they can be multiple, they are not typically septated or associated with molar pregnancies.

C. Yolk sac tumor is a type of germ cell tumor that can occur in the ovaries, but it is not related to the ovarian findings in this scenario.

D. Luteoma of pregnancy is a rare benign tumor that can occur in the ovaries during pregnancy, but it is not typically associated with multiple thin-walled, septated cysts.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the ovarian findings in this scenario is theca lutein cysts.",Success
"A 75-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her son because of a 2-day history of fever, headache, malaise, and dry cough. The patient lives with her son and his family and her son reports that other members of the family have had similar symptoms during the past week but that he has not had any symptoms. The result of a polymerase chain reaction test confirms that the woman is infected with a virus that has a helical capsid and a segmented genome. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the son being free of symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Serum antibodies against hemagglutinin.

The patient's symptoms and the result of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test suggest that she is infected with the influenza virus, which has a helical capsid and a segmented genome.

The son's lack of symptoms despite being exposed to the virus is likely due to the presence of serum antibodies against hemagglutinin (HA), a protein on the surface of the influenza virus. Hemagglutinin is one of the two main surface proteins of the influenza virus, and it plays a crucial role in the virus's ability to infect host cells. Antibodies against HA can neutralize the virus and prevent infection.

The other options are not directly related to the son's lack of symptoms in this scenario:

B. Downregulation of ICAM-1 expression: ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1) is a receptor involved in the immune response, but its downregulation is not directly related to protection against influenza infection.

C. Protease-resistant antibodies in nasal secretions: While antibodies in nasal secretions can provide local immunity against influenza, the question asks about the son's lack of symptoms, which is more likely related to systemic immunity (i.e., serum antibodies).

D. Homozygous mutation in the CCR5 gene: This mutation is associated with resistance to HIV infection, not influenza.

E. High concentration of circulating T cells: While T cells are important in the immune response to influenza, a high concentration of circulating T cells is not a specific explanation for the son's lack of symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Serum antibodies against hemagglutinin.",Success
"A 71-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine visit. His psychiatric history is significant for major depression with psychotic features. He was diagnosed after his wife died from pancreatic cancer four years earlier. Three years ago, he deliberately overdosed on sleeping pills. Today, he feels well but still wakes up frequently at night and cannot sleep through the night. He lives alone in his apartment and has no children. He does not possess a firearm at home but has access to weapons at a local hunting club. The patient currently denies suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm. He takes sertraline and olanzapine. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for suicide in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Previous suicide attempt.

According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, a previous suicide attempt is the strongest risk factor for suicide. This patient has a history of a deliberate overdose on sleeping pills three years ago, which significantly increases his risk of future suicide attempts.

While the other options are also risk factors for suicide, they are not as strong as a previous suicide attempt:

B. History of psychosis: Psychosis can increase the risk of suicide, but it is not as strong a predictor as a previous suicide attempt.

C. Access to firearms: Access to firearms can increase the risk of suicide, especially in older adults. However, in this case, the patient does not possess a firearm at home, and his access to weapons at the local hunting club is not a guarantee of easy access.

D. Sleeping disorder: Sleep disturbances can contribute to suicidal ideation, but they are not a strong risk factor for suicide on their own.

E. Age: Older adults are at higher risk for suicide, but age alone is not as strong a predictor as a previous suicide attempt.

It's essential to note that the patient's current denial of suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm does not eliminate the risk of suicide. The patient's history of a previous suicide attempt, combined with his age and psychiatric history, warrants close monitoring and regular follow-up appointments to assess his mental health and suicide risk.",Success
"A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a generalized rash for 3 days. During this period, he has had severe itching and was not able to sleep well.

There is no cervical lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Chickenpox.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as a generalized rash, severe itching, fever, headache, and muscle pain, are consistent with chickenpox (varicella).
* The rash is described as having macules, papules, and crusted lesions, which is typical of chickenpox. The presence of fluid-filled vesicles on the abdomen and back further supports this diagnosis.
* The patient's age and attendance at a daycare center increase the likelihood of exposure to varicella-zoster virus.
* The fact that the patient had a runny nose 5 days prior, which subsided with over-the-counter medications, suggests a possible viral prodrome, which is common in chickenpox.
* The physical examination findings, including the absence of cervical lymphadenopathy, are also consistent with chickenpox.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

* A. Measles: The rash in measles typically starts on the face and spreads downward, whereas the patient's rash is described as generalized. Measles also typically presents with conjunctivitis and cough, which are not mentioned in the scenario.
* B. Urushiol-induced dermatitis: This is a contact dermatitis caused by exposure to poison ivy, oak, or sumac. While the patient did go on a camping trip, the rash is not limited to exposed areas, and the symptoms are more consistent with a viral infection.
* C. Scarlet fever: This is typically associated with a sandpaper-like rash, which is not described in the scenario. Scarlet fever is also usually accompanied by a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes, which are not mentioned.
* E. Rubella: The rash in rubella is typically mild and short-lived, and the patient's symptoms are more severe and prolonged. Rubella is also typically associated with lymphadenopathy, which is not present in this case.

Neurologic examination shows dilated pupils bilaterally and diffuse hyperreflexia. His feet are cold, and capillary refill time is 3 seconds. After the examination, the patient starts screaming and tries to bite the physician. Urine toxicology screening is positive for ethyl glucuronide. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?""",E,"The correct answer is E. Synthetic cathinone intoxication.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as unusual behavior, paranoia, agitation, and hallucinations (""The government is following me everywhere""), are consistent with a substance-induced psychotic episode. The physical examination findings, including dilated pupils, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, and cold extremities, suggest a sympathomimetic toxidrome.

The presence of ethyl glucuronide in the urine toxicology screening indicates recent ethanol consumption, but it is unlikely to be the primary cause of the patient's symptoms. The patient's medications, amitriptyline and diphenhydramine, are not typically associated with this presentation.

Synthetic cathinones, also known as ""bath salts,"" are a class of drugs that can cause a sympathomimetic toxidrome, agitation, and psychotic symptoms. They are often used recreationally and can be found at parties. The patient's symptoms, including the sudden onset of unusual behavior, are consistent with synthetic cathinone intoxication.

Brief psychotic disorder (Option A) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's physical examination findings and the presence of sympathomimetic symptoms.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (Option B) is a rare but life-threatening side effect of antipsychotic medications, characterized by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and autonomic instability. The patient's temperature is only mildly elevated, and there is no history of antipsychotic use.

Anticholinergic toxicity (Option C) can cause agitation, hallucinations, and sympathomimetic symptoms, but it is less likely given the patient's physical examination findings, such as dilated pupils and hyperreflexia, which are not typical of anticholinergic toxicity.

Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) intoxication (Option D) can cause hallucinations and altered perception, but it is less likely given the patient's sympathomimetic symptoms and physical examination findings.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are most consistent with synthetic cathinone intoxication.",Success
"A 22-year-old male presents to the emergency room complaining of neck stiffness. He reports that his neck started “locking” three hours ago. He is now unable to move it.

He speaks in full sentences and is oriented to person, place, and time. The patient’s neck is flexed and rotated to the right approximately 40 degrees. The right sternocleidomastoid and trapezius are firm and contracted. Extraocular movements are full and intact. Upon further questioning, he reports that he took more medication four hours ago because he was hearing voices. Which of the following should most likely be administered to this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Benztropine.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the acute onset of neck stiffness and inability to move his neck, are consistent with an acute dystonic reaction. This is a common adverse effect of antipsychotic medications, which are often used to treat schizophrenia. The patient's report of taking more medication four hours ago because he was hearing voices suggests that he may have taken an increased dose of his antipsychotic medication, leading to the dystonic reaction.

Benztropine is an anticholinergic medication that is commonly used to treat acute dystonic reactions. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that can contribute to muscle spasms and stiffness. Benztropine is often administered intravenously or intramuscularly in the emergency department to rapidly relieve symptoms of dystonia.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Glycopyrrolate is an anticholinergic medication, but it is not typically used to treat acute dystonic reactions.

C. Levodopa is a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease, and it is not indicated for acute dystonic reactions.

D. Dantrolene is a medication used to treat malignant hyperthermia, a rare but life-threatening condition that can occur in response to certain medications, including antipsychotics. While the patient's symptoms are concerning, there is no indication of malignant hyperthermia in this scenario.

E. Propranolol is a beta blocker that is sometimes used to treat anxiety or tremors, but it is not indicated for acute dystonic reactions.

"A 13-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. Physical examination shows hepatosplenomegaly. A venous blood sample obtained for routine screening tests is milky. After refrigeration, a creamy supernatant layer appears on top of the sample. Genetic analysis shows a mutation in the apolipoprotein C-II gene (APOC2) on chromosome 19. This patient is at greatest risk for developing which of the following complications?",A,"The correct answer is A. Acute pancreatitis.

The patient's symptoms, including hepatosplenomegaly and a milky venous blood sample that forms a creamy supernatant layer after refrigeration, are consistent with a diagnosis of familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). FCS is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the apolipoprotein C-II gene (APOC2), which is involved in the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.

One of the most significant complications of FCS is acute pancreatitis, which occurs in up to 80% of patients with the disorder. The high levels of chylomicrons in the blood can cause inflammation and damage to the pancreas, leading to recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis.

The other options are not directly related to FCS:

B. Myocardial infarction: While patients with FCS may be at increased risk for cardiovascular disease due to their lipid abnormalities, myocardial infarction is not a direct complication of the disorder.

C. Corneal arci: This is a condition characterized by a grayish or white ring around the cornea, often seen in patients with lipid disorders such as familial hypercholesterolemia. While patients with FCS may have lipid abnormalities, corneal arci is not a typical complication of the disorder.

D. Cholesterol embolization syndrome: This is a condition that occurs when cholesterol crystals break off from atherosclerotic plaques and embolize to distant tissues, causing inflammation and damage. While patients with FCS may be at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, cholesterol embolization syndrome is not a direct complication of the disorder.

E. Cerebrovascular accident: While patients with FCS may be at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular accident (stroke) is not a direct complication of the disorder.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and genetic analysis are consistent with a diagnosis of FCS, and the greatest risk for complication is acute pancreatitis.",Success
"A 41-year-old man comes to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea for the past 2 days. His abdominal discomfort is worse shortly after meals.

Aspartate aminotransferase, serum 15 U/L
Alkaline phosphatase, serum 42 U/L
Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient?""",D,"The correct answer is D. Administer calcium gluconate.

The patient's symptoms, such as perioral numbness, upper-extremity muscle cramping, and spasm of the hand, suggest hypocalcemia (low calcium levels). The patient's recent total thyroidectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery increase the risk of hypocalcemia due to potential parathyroid gland damage or malabsorption of calcium.

The laboratory results support this diagnosis, with a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 115 pg/mL, which is elevated, indicating that the parathyroid glands are responding to low calcium levels. The calcium level is not directly measured in the provided laboratory results, but the patient's symptoms and elevated PTH level suggest hypocalcemia.

Administering calcium gluconate is the most appropriate initial step in managing this patient. Calcium gluconate is a form of calcium that can be administered intravenously to rapidly correct hypocalcemia.

Option A, obtaining an abdominal CT, is not necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with hypocalcemia than an acute abdominal process.

Option B, observation only, is not appropriate, as the patient's symptoms require prompt treatment to prevent further complications.

Option C, beginning rehydration therapy, may be necessary, but it is not the most critical initial step in managing this patient's hypocalcemia.

Option E, supplementation with vitamin D, is not the most immediate concern, as vitamin D deficiency can contribute to hypocalcemia, but it is not the primary cause of the patient's symptoms in this scenario.",Success

Plasma renin activity 10 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5–3.3 ng/mL/hr)
Plasma aldosterone concentration 20 ng/dL (normal, 2–9 ng/dL)
What is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Bartter's syndrome.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as generalized weakness, increased urination, and increased thirst, suggest a disorder of electrolyte balance and fluid regulation. The physical examination findings, including short stature and low weight, are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The laboratory results provide further clues:

* Hypokalemia (low potassium levels) is a key feature of Bartter's syndrome, which is caused by a defect in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidneys. This defect leads to excessive potassium loss in the urine.
* Elevated urinary calcium excretion is also consistent with Bartter's syndrome, as the kidneys are unable to reabsorb calcium properly.
* The plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration are both elevated, which suggests that the kidneys are trying to compensate for the potassium loss by increasing the production of these hormones. This is a characteristic finding in Bartter's syndrome.

Primary hyperaldosteronism (option B) is unlikely, as it typically presents with hypertension, which is not seen in this patient. Renal artery stenosis (option A) is also unlikely, as it would not typically cause hypokalemia or elevated urinary calcium excretion. Pheochromocytoma (option D) is a rare tumor that causes excessive catecholamine production, leading to hypertension, tachycardia, and other symptoms not seen in this patient. Gitelman's syndrome (option E) is a similar disorder to Bartter's syndrome, but it typically presents with hypocalciuria (low urinary calcium excretion) rather than hypercalciuria.

Therefore, based on the combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Bartter's syndrome.",Success

Physical examination reveals slight jaundice and pale conjunctiva. The spleen is tender and easily palpable. After a complete blood count with differential and an abdominal ultrasound, the patient is found to have sickle-cell disease with splenic infarct. A partial splenectomy is performed. After the operation, the physician provides vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The picture shows a slide obtained from the resected portion of the patient’s spleen. Dysfunction of the zone marked with which number predisposes the patient to the aforementioned infections?",D,"The correct answer is E. 1, 2, and 3.

The image shows a histological section of the spleen, and the zones marked are:

1. White pulp: This is the lymphoid tissue of the spleen, responsible for immune function and filtering the blood.
2. Red pulp: This is the vascular sinusoids of the spleen, responsible for filtering the blood and removing old or damaged red blood cells.
3. Marginal zone: This is the area between the white and red pulp, responsible for trapping and removing pathogens from the bloodstream.

In the context of splenic dysfunction, particularly after a partial splenectomy, the patient is at increased risk of infections due to the impaired function of all three zones:

* White pulp (1): Impaired immune function and reduced antibody production increase the risk of infections.
* Red pulp (2): Reduced filtering capacity allows pathogens to circulate in the bloodstream, increasing the risk of infection.
* Marginal zone (3): Impaired trapping and removal of pathogens from the bloodstream increase the risk of infection.

The physician's decision to administer vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae is justified, as these pathogens are commonly associated with overwhelming infections in individuals with splenic dysfunction.

In addition to her primary diagnosis, which of the following is this patient most at risk for developing in the future?",B,"The correct answer is B. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder characterized by dry eyes and mouth, as well as inflammation of the exocrine glands. The presence of anti-Ro and anti-La autoantibodies at high titers supports this diagnosis.

Patients with Sjögren's syndrome are at increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. This is because the chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation in Sjögren's syndrome can lead to the development of malignant lymphoid cells.

The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, coughing up blood, shortness of breath, and dark urine, along with the positive anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) serologies, suggest a diagnosis of Goodpasture's syndrome. This is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the production of antibodies against the glomerular basement membrane, leading to glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage.

Linear IgG staining on immunofluorescence is a specific feature of Goodpasture's syndrome, as it indicates the presence of antibodies bound to the glomerular basement membrane. This finding is diagnostic for the condition.

"A 32-year-old man with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department by his roommate because of a 2-week history of progressively worsening headache and vomiting. Current medications include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dolutegravir, and tenofovir-emtricitabine. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F). Physical examination shows nuchal rigidity. Kernig and Brudzinski signs are present. A lumbar puncture is performed and shows an opening pressure of 32 cm H2O (N: < 20). The pathogen isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be cultured on Sabouraud agar. Further evaluation of this patient's CSF is most likely to show which of the following additional findings?",A,"The correct answer is A. Positive latex agglutination test.

The patient's symptoms, such as headache, vomiting, and nuchal rigidity, along with the presence of Kernig and Brudzinski signs, suggest meningitis. The isolation of a pathogen from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that can be cultured on Sabouraud agar points to Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus that commonly causes meningitis in immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV infection.

The latex agglutination test is a diagnostic test that detects the presence of cryptococcal antigen in the CSF. It is a sensitive and specific test for diagnosing cryptococcal meningitis. Therefore, it is likely that the patient's CSF will show a positive latex agglutination test.

The other options are not correct because:

B. HSV-2 DNA is typically associated with herpes simplex virus infections, not fungal meningitis.

C. Tachyzoites are a stage in the life cycle of Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite that can cause toxoplasmosis, but it is not typically associated with fungal meningitis.

D. Adenosine deaminase concentration is increased in viral and bacterial meningitis, but it is not a specific marker for fungal meningitis.

E. JC virus DNA is associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a demyelinating disease that affects the central nervous system, but it is not typically associated with fungal meningitis.

It's worth noting that the patient's HIV infection and the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which is also used to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, increase the risk of opportunistic infections like cryptococcal meningitis.",Success
"A 70-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of back pain. For the past six days, she has had a burning pain in her upper right back and chest. She cannot recall any recent injury and has no prior history of back pain. She has a history of hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux. The patient volunteers at an animal shelter three times a week. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Current medications include ramipril and pantoprazole. The patient appears healthy and well nourished. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.42°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. Examination shows a long erythematous rash covered with multiple clear vesicles and crusty lesions extending from her back to below her right breast. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of the disease?",A,"The correct answer is A. Viral reactivation in dorsal root ganglia.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of herpes zoster, also known as shingles. The burning pain in the upper right back and chest, accompanied by a long erythematous rash with multiple clear vesicles and crusty lesions, is a classic presentation of herpes zoster.

Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which remains dormant in the dorsal root ganglia after a primary infection with chickenpox. The virus reactivates and travels down the nerve pathways to the skin, causing the characteristic rash and pain.

Option B is incorrect because IgA deposits in the upper dermis are more consistent with a diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis, a skin condition associated with celiac disease.

Option C is incorrect because bacterial lymphatic infection of the epidermis is more consistent with a diagnosis of cellulitis or erysipelas, which would typically present with a more widespread and diffuse rash, rather than a localized, dermatomal distribution.

Option D is incorrect because infestation with bloodsucking parasites, such as fleas or ticks, would not typically cause a rash with clear vesicles and crusty lesions.

Option E is incorrect because brown recluse spider envenomation typically causes a necrotic lesion with a characteristic ""bull's-eye"" appearance, rather than a dermatomal rash with vesicles and crusty lesions.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Dermatology both support the diagnosis of herpes zoster as a viral reactivation in dorsal root ganglia.",Success
"A type of fatal adrenal cancer has an average survival rate of 3 years after the onset of clinically significant symptoms. It is determined that patients have a 4-year asymptomatic period prior to developing clinical symptoms from this adrenal cancer. A new screening test is developed, and the cancer can now be detected 2 years prior to developing clinical symptoms. A new observational case-control study of screened and unscreened patients measures the median 5-year survival of patients who decline medical and surgical treatment. The screened population has statistically better outcomes. Which step should be undertaken to prevent bias in these conclusions?",B,"The correct answer is B. Using mortality rates in the analysis.

The study is comparing the 5-year survival rates of screened and unscreened patients who decline medical and surgical treatment. However, the screening test allows for earlier detection of the cancer, which can lead to lead-time bias. Lead-time bias occurs when a screening test detects a disease earlier than it would have been clinically diagnosed, but does not actually change the course of the disease. This can result in an apparent improvement in survival rates, even if the screening test does not actually affect the outcome.

To prevent lead-time bias, it is better to analyze mortality rates rather than survival rates. Mortality rates are a more accurate measure of the effectiveness of the screening test, as they are less susceptible to lead-time bias. By using mortality rates, the study can determine if the screening test actually reduces the number of deaths from the cancer, rather than just detecting it earlier.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Using survival rates in the analysis can be misleading due to lead-time bias, as mentioned above.

C. Analyzing the results by age of diagnosis may be useful for identifying high-risk groups, but it does not address the issue of lead-time bias.

D. Increasing the number of screened individuals may provide more data, but it does not address the methodological issue of lead-time bias.

E. Decreasing the number of screened individuals is not a viable solution, as it would reduce the power of the study and make it more difficult to detect any real effects of the screening test.",Success
"A 60-year-old man presents to the office for shortness of breath. The shortness of breath started a year ago and is exacerbated by physical activity. He has been working in the glass manufacturing industry for 20 years. His vital signs include: heart rate 72/min, respiratory rate 30/min, and blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg. On physical exam, there are diminished respiratory sounds on both sides. On the chest radiograph, interstitial fibrosis with reticulonodular infiltrate is found on both sides, and there is also an eggshell calcification of multiple adenopathies. What is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Silicosis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and chest radiograph results are consistent with silicosis. The key features that point to silicosis are:

1. Occupational exposure: The patient has worked in the glass manufacturing industry for 20 years, which increases his risk of silicosis due to exposure to silica dust.
2. Interstitial fibrosis with reticulonodular infiltrate on chest radiograph: This is a characteristic finding in silicosis, indicating lung tissue scarring and inflammation.
3. Eggshell calcification of multiple adenopathies: This is a pathognomonic feature of silicosis, where the lymph nodes in the chest cavity become calcified, resembling an eggshell.

While the other options are also occupational lung diseases, they do not match the patient's presentation as closely as silicosis:

A. Berylliosis: Typically affects workers in the aerospace or electronics industries, and chest radiographs often show a more diffuse infiltrate.

C. Asbestosis: Usually associated with asbestos exposure, and the chest radiograph would typically show a more peripheral, subpleural distribution of fibrosis.

D. Talcosis: Typically seen in individuals who have inhaled talc powder, often in the context of drug abuse or occupational exposure. The chest radiograph would show a more nodular pattern.

E. Byssinosis: A disease caused by inhalation of cotton dust, typically affecting textile workers. The symptoms are often more acute, and the chest radiograph would show a more diffuse infiltrate.

The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) provide guidelines for the diagnosis and management of silicosis, which support the diagnosis in this case.",Success

An S3 heart sound and rales in the lower right and left lung lobes are heard. A 12-lead ECG shows no significant findings. Echocardiography shows an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium. The patient is stabilized and informed about the diagnosis and possible treatment options. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome. The recent loss of her husband in a car accident suggests a significant emotional stressor, which is a common trigger for this condition.

The physical examination findings, such as the S3 heart sound and rales in the lower lung lobes, suggest left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The echocardiography results showing an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium further support this diagnosis.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a condition in which intense emotional or physical stress leads to a sudden weakening of the heart muscle, resulting in symptoms similar to a heart attack. It is often seen in postmenopausal women and is typically reversible with treatment.

The other options are not as likely based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings:

A. Aortic stenosis would typically present with a systolic murmur and would not explain the patient's symptoms of chest pain and heart failure.

B. Atrial fibrillation would not explain the patient's symptoms of chest pain and heart failure, and the ECG would likely show atrial fibrillation, which is not mentioned.

C. Constrictive pericarditis would typically present with a pericardial friction rub and would not explain the patient's symptoms of chest pain and heart failure.

E. Restrictive cardiomyopathy would typically present with a restrictive filling pattern on echocardiography, which is not mentioned in the patient's results.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are most consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, making it the most likely diagnosis.",Success

At the hospital, his pulse is 95/min, the blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, the respirations are 20/min, and the oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, the unconscious man is covered in bloody vomit with small clots and food particles. He smells of alcohol. A digital exam reveals black tarry stool in the rectal vault. The patient is given oxygen, IV fluids, and an NG-tube is placed and set to intermittent suction. Labs are sent and the patient is prepared for a procedure. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in his management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Undergo upper GI endoscopy.

Here's why:

The patient presents with signs of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, including bloody vomit, black tarry stool, and a history of alcoholism. The presence of coffee ground emesis and melena (black tarry stool) suggests bleeding from the upper GI tract, likely from the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum.

Upper GI endoscopy is the most appropriate next step in management because it allows for direct visualization of the upper GI tract to identify the source of bleeding and potentially treat it endoscopically. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines recommend urgent upper GI endoscopy within 24 hours of admission for patients with acute upper GI bleeding.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps:

A. Colonoscopy is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient's symptoms suggest upper GI bleeding, not lower GI bleeding.

C. Selective mesenteric angiography may be used to diagnose and treat bleeding from the small intestine or colon, but it is not the first-line investigation for upper GI bleeding.

D. Proton pump inhibitors with anti-H. pylori regimen may be used to treat peptic ulcer disease, but it is not the most urgent step in managing this patient's acute bleeding.

E. Surgery for peptic ulcer disease may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the initial management step for this patient. Endoscopy should be performed first to identify the source of bleeding and potentially treat it endoscopically.

In summary, upper GI endoscopy is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's upper GI bleeding.",Success
"An 8-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of hematuria. Two weeks ago, she had a sore throat that resolved without treatment. Physical examination shows 1+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Urinalysis shows numerous RBCs and 3+ proteinuria. Her antistreptolysin O titer is elevated. Formation of which of the following is most likely involved in the underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Antigen-antibody complexes.

The patient's symptoms, including hematuria, edema, and proteinuria, are consistent with post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN), a complication of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection. The elevated antistreptolysin O titer supports this diagnosis.

In PIGN, the immune system responds to the streptococcal infection by producing antibodies against the bacterial antigens. These antibodies then combine with the antigens to form immune complexes, which circulate in the bloodstream and eventually deposit in the glomeruli of the kidneys. The deposition of these immune complexes triggers an inflammatory response, leading to glomerular damage and the symptoms observed in this patient.

The other options are not directly related to the underlying mechanism of PIGN:

A. Antigen-specific IgE binding to mast cells is involved in allergic reactions, not PIGN.

B. Tissue-specific antibodies are involved in autoimmune disorders, not PIGN.

C. Presensitized CD4+ helper T-cells are involved in cell-mediated immune responses, not PIGN.

E. Presensitized CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells are involved in cell-mediated immune responses, not PIGN.

The patient is being resuscitated in the trauma bay. Which of the following was most likely to be found on exam?",C,"The correct answer is C. Miosis.

The patient's presentation with altered mental status, slow respirations, and unknown past medical history suggests opioid overdose. The patient's vital signs, particularly the slow respiratory rate, support this diagnosis. Opioid overdose is commonly associated with miosis (pinpoint pupils), which is a hallmark sign of opioid toxicity.

The other options are not as likely to be found on exam in this scenario:

A. Ataxia (loss of coordination) is not typically associated with opioid overdose.

B. Conjunctival injection (redness of the eyes) is more commonly seen in allergic reactions or infectious processes, not opioid overdose.

D. Mydriasis (dilated pupils) is the opposite of miosis and is not typically seen in opioid overdose.

The patient’s previous pregnancies were uncomplicated, and she delivered three healthy babies at full term. On the ultrasound, the technician observes a male fetus with likely intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). She also notes microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, and clenched fists with overlapping fingers. The technician further notes a medium-sized ventricular septal defect (VSD). The amniotic fluid index (AFI) is 26 cm.

Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be observed in this fetus?",D,"The correct answer is B. Epicanthal folds.

Based on the ultrasound findings, the fetus is likely to have Down syndrome (Trisomy 21). The observed features, such as microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and ventricular septal defect (VSD), are all consistent with this diagnosis. Epicanthal folds, which are skin folds at the inner corner of the eyes, are a common facial feature in individuals with Down syndrome.

The other options are not as likely to be observed in this fetus:

A. Cleft palate is not a typical feature of Down syndrome, although it can occur in some cases.

C. Micropthalmia (small eyes) is not a characteristic feature of Down syndrome.

D. Prominent occiput (back of the head) is not a specific feature of Down syndrome.

E. Webbed neck is a characteristic feature of Turner syndrome, not Down syndrome.

During the evening, the patient becomes irritable. He is talking to someone despite nobody being present in the room. He is easily agitated and attempts to strike a nurse with a remote control to his TV. Subsequently, the patient keeps getting out of bed and trying to walk away despite being a fall risk. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Olanzapine.

The patient is exhibiting symptoms of delirium, a common complication in hospitalized elderly patients, particularly those with underlying infections like urosepsis. Delirium is characterized by acute changes in mental status, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered levels of consciousness.

Olanzapine, an antipsychotic medication, is a recommended treatment for delirium in hospitalized patients, especially those with hyperactive delirium, which is characterized by agitation, aggression, and restlessness, as seen in this patient. Olanzapine has been shown to be effective in reducing the severity and duration of delirium (1).

Diphenhydramine (A) is an antihistamine that can exacerbate delirium and is not recommended for its management. Lorazepam (B) is a benzodiazepine that may be used for anxiety or agitation, but it can worsen delirium in elderly patients and is not a first-line treatment for delirium. Phenobarbital (D) is a barbiturate that is not typically used to manage delirium.

Physical restraints (E) should be avoided whenever possible, as they can increase agitation and worsen delirium. Instead, non-pharmacological interventions, such as reorientation, calming measures, and ensuring a safe environment, should be attempted first. If pharmacological intervention is necessary, olanzapine is a more appropriate choice.

"A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, weight loss, and muscle aches during the past 2 months. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. Her only medication is a multivitamin. A metyrapone stimulation test is performed and the results rule out a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Which of the following changes in laboratory findings are most likely to have been observed in this patient following the administration of the drug?",A,"The correct answer is A. Increase in serum ACTH.

Here's why:

A metyrapone stimulation test is used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency, which is a condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol. Metyrapone is a medication that inhibits the enzyme 11β-hydroxylase, which is necessary for the production of cortisol in the adrenal glands. When metyrapone is administered, it blocks the production of cortisol, leading to an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion from the pituitary gland. This is because the pituitary gland senses the decrease in cortisol levels and responds by increasing ACTH production to stimulate the adrenal glands to produce more cortisol.

In a patient with normal adrenal function, the administration of metyrapone would lead to an increase in serum ACTH levels. This is because the pituitary gland is responding to the decreased cortisol levels by increasing ACTH production.

In contrast, a patient with adrenal insufficiency would not be able to increase ACTH production in response to metyrapone, as their adrenal glands are not capable of producing cortisol.

The other options are not correct because:

* B. Decrease in urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids: Metyrapone would actually increase urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids, as the blockage of cortisol production would lead to an increase in the production of 11-deoxycortisol, which is then converted to 17-hydroxycorticosteroids in the liver.
* C. Decrease in serum 11-deoxycortisol: Metyrapone would actually increase serum 11-deoxycortisol, as it blocks the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol.
* D. Increase in serum cortisol: Metyrapone would actually decrease serum cortisol, as it blocks the production of cortisol in the adrenal glands.
* E. Increase in urine metanephrines: Metyrapone is not related to the production of metanephrines, which are metabolites of catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine.",Success
An investigator conducts a study to determine whether earlier detection of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in patients increases survival time. One subset of study participants consists of asymptomatic individuals who were diagnosed with GBM after undergoing a screening MRI of the brain. The other subset of study participants was diagnosed with GBM only after they developed symptoms. Results from the study show that the asymptomatic patients who were diagnosed with screening MRI had an average survival time that was 6 weeks longer than that of the patients who were diagnosed after symptom onset. Which of the following statistical biases is most likely to have occurred as a result of the endpoint selected for this study?,E,"The correct answer is E. Lead-time bias.

In this study, the endpoint is survival time, which is the time from diagnosis to death. The asymptomatic patients who were diagnosed with screening MRI had an average survival time that was 6 weeks longer than that of the patients who were diagnosed after symptom onset. This apparent increase in survival time may be due to lead-time bias.

Lead-time bias occurs when a screening test detects a disease at an earlier stage, but the overall survival time is not actually increased. Instead, the time from diagnosis to death is simply shifted forward, giving the appearance of increased survival time. In this case, the screening MRI detected GBM earlier in the asymptomatic patients, which may have led to an apparent increase in survival time. However, it is possible that the patients would have developed symptoms and been diagnosed at the same point in the natural history of the disease, regardless of the screening test.

The other options are not directly related to the endpoint of survival time and the design of this study:

A. Observer-expectancy bias refers to the phenomenon where an investigator's expectations influence the outcome of a study.

B. Length-time bias refers to the tendency of screening tests to detect slower-growing tumors, which may have a better prognosis.

C. Confounding bias occurs when a third variable affects both the exposure and the outcome, leading to a spurious association.

D. Surveillance bias refers to the increased detection of disease in a population due to increased surveillance or screening, rather than an actual increase in disease incidence.

Therefore, lead-time bias is the most likely explanation for the apparent increase in survival time in the asymptomatic patients diagnosed with screening MRI.",Success

Decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance on percussion are noted on the left. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Needle decompression.

Here's why:

The patient presents with severe chest pain, dyspnea, and hypotension, which suggests a life-threatening thoracic injury. The physical examination reveals jugular venous distention, decreased breath sounds, and hyperresonance on percussion on the left side, indicating a tension pneumothorax. The patient's oxygen saturation is also low, which further supports this diagnosis.

Tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency that requires immediate intervention. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform a needle decompression to relieve the pressure in the chest cavity. This is a quick and effective way to stabilize the patient before further evaluation or definitive treatment.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps:

A. CT scan of the chest: While a CT scan may be useful in evaluating the extent of thoracic injuries, it is not the most urgent priority in this scenario. The patient requires immediate intervention to relieve the tension pneumothorax.

B. Bronchoscopy: Bronchoscopy is not indicated in this scenario, as it would not address the life-threatening tension pneumothorax.

C. Emergency thoracotomy: While thoracotomy may be necessary in some cases of thoracic trauma, it is not the initial management step for a tension pneumothorax. Needle decompression is a less invasive and more rapid way to relieve the pressure.

E. X-ray of the chest: While a chest X-ray may be useful in evaluating the extent of thoracic injuries, it would not provide immediate relief for the tension pneumothorax. Needle decompression is the priority.

What is the test’s overall specificity?",E,"The correct answer is E. 580 / (580 + 20).

To calculate the specificity of the test, we need to know the number of true negatives (patients without PD who test negative) and the number of false positives (patients without PD who test positive).

From the question, we know that:

* 590 patients with PD test positive (true positives)
* 20 patients without PD test positive (false positives)
* 600 patients without PD were enrolled, so 600 - 20 = 580 patients without PD test negative (true negatives)

Specificity is defined as the number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives. Therefore, the specificity of the test is:

Specificity = 580 / (580 + 20) = 580 / 600 = 0.967 or 96.7%

The patient’s knees are enlarged, bilaterally, and he has pain and crepitus on passive range of motion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Osteoarthritis.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as bilateral wrist and knee pain, morning stiffness, and joint tenderness, are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA).
* The presence of non-tender nodules on the distal interphalangeal joints, also known as Heberden's nodes, is a characteristic feature of OA.
* The tenderness at the base of both thumbs suggests involvement of the first carpometacarpal joints, which is a common site for OA.
* The bilateral knee enlargement, pain, and crepitus on passive range of motion are also consistent with OA.
* The patient's history as a professional athlete increases his risk for developing OA, particularly in weight-bearing joints like the knees.
* The absence of joint swelling, color changes, dryness of mucous membranes, and constitutional symptoms makes rheumatoid arthritis (RA) less likely. RA typically presents with more inflammatory features, such as joint swelling, redness, and warmth.
* Ankylosing spondylitis is unlikely given the lack of symptoms suggestive of axial involvement, such as back pain or stiffness.
* Gout is unlikely given the absence of acute, severe joint pain and swelling, which are characteristic of gouty attacks.
* Fibromyalgia is unlikely given the lack of widespread musculoskeletal pain and tender points.

According to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria, OA is diagnosed based on a combination of clinical features, including joint pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion, as well as radiographic evidence of joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation. In this case, the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with OA, making it the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 40-year-old businessman who was previously well is brought into the emergency department by his assistant with a complaint of left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation. He has never felt like this before. Past medical history is insignificant. His blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, pulse 86/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F). A T2-weighted MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. The patient is treated with cervical immobilization, a course of steroids, and physical therapy. What other finding will most likely be seen in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is A. Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion.

The patient's symptoms and MRI findings suggest a spinal cord injury (SCI) at the C5 level, likely caused by the chiropractic neck manipulation. The left-sided weakness and hemicord lesion on the MRI are consistent with a Brown-Séquard syndrome, which is a type of incomplete SCI.

In a Brown-Séquard syndrome, the lesion affects one half of the spinal cord, resulting in a characteristic pattern of neurological deficits. The patient will typically exhibit:

* Ipsilateral (same side as the lesion) motor weakness or paralysis at the level of the lesion, which in this case would be the left side (consistent with the patient's symptoms).
* Ipsilateral loss of proprioception and vibration sense below the level of the lesion.
* Contralateral (opposite side of the lesion) loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of the lesion.

As the patient recovers, the paralysis at the level of the lesion (C5) will likely become spastic, meaning it will be accompanied by increased muscle tone and hyperreflexia. This is because the spinal cord injury disrupts the normal inhibitory pathways, leading to an overactive stretch reflex.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and MRI findings:

* B. Right-sided Horner's syndrome is a rare complication of spinal cord injury, but it would not be directly related to the C5 hemicord lesion.
* C. Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement would result in weakness or paralysis on the opposite side of the body, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.
* D. Right-sided analgesia would be expected if the lesion were on the right side of the spinal cord, not the left.

"A previously healthy 19-year-old man comes to the physician with right-sided, dull, throbbing scrotal pain for 12 hours. He has also had a burning sensation on urination and increased urinary frequency for the past 3 days. He has not had urethral discharge. He is sexually active with one female partner and does not use condoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a tender right testicle; lifting it provides relief. The penis appears normal, with no discharge at the meatus. Laboratory studies show a normal complete blood count; urinalysis shows 3 WBC/hpf. A Gram stain of a urethral swab shows polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no organisms. Testicular ultrasound shows increased blood flow to the right testicle compared to the left. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Chlamydia trachomatis infection.

Here's why:

The patient presents with right-sided scrotal pain, burning sensation on urination, and increased urinary frequency, which suggests an inflammatory process in the genitourinary tract. The physical examination reveals a tender right testicle, and lifting it provides relief, which is consistent with epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis).

The laboratory studies show a normal complete blood count, which rules out a severe infection or inflammation. The urinalysis shows 3 WBC/hpf, indicating a mild inflammatory response. The Gram stain of a urethral swab shows polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no organisms, which suggests that the infection is not caused by a bacterial pathogen that can be detected by Gram stain.

The testicular ultrasound shows increased blood flow to the right testicle compared to the left, which is consistent with epididymitis.

Given the patient's age, sexual activity, and symptoms, Chlamydia trachomatis infection is the most likely cause of epididymitis. Chlamydia is a common cause of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in young adults, and it can cause epididymitis, urethritis, and cervicitis.

Option A, Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, is possible but less likely, as the patient does not have urethral discharge, and the Gram stain did not show any organisms.

Option B, Testicular tumor, is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with an inflammatory process, and the ultrasound does not suggest a mass.

Option C, Treponema pallidum infection (syphilis), is also unlikely, as the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of syphilis, such as a chancre or lymphadenopathy.

Option E, Varicocele, is a condition characterized by dilated veins in the scrotum, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory studies, Chlamydia trachomatis infection is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.",Success
"A 4-month-old infant is brought to the office by his parents due to sudden nose bleeding without trauma of any kind. He has a 1-month history of multiple bruising that measures 1 cm in diameter each in the hands and feet, and tiny red spots that appeared in the upper and lower extremities without any trauma either. He has no prior bleeding history nor any relevant family history. The vital signs include: heart rate 190/min, respiratory rate 40/min, blood pressure 99/42 mm Hg, and temperature 36.6 °C (97.9 °F).

The blood smear shows hypochromia, poikilocytosis, and large platelets, while a platelet aggregation test with ristocetin is normal. The overall bleeding time is increased. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is D. Bernard-Soulier disease.

Here's a breakdown of the patient's symptoms and laboratory results that support this diagnosis:

1. **Nose bleeding without trauma**: This suggests a bleeding disorder, which is consistent with Bernard-Soulier disease.
2. **Multiple bruising and petechiae**: The presence of easy bruising and petechiae (small red spots) on the skin and mucous membranes indicates a platelet disorder.
3. **Complete Blood Count (CBC) results**: The platelet count is elevated (450,000/mm3), which is not consistent with thrombocytopenia. However, the blood smear shows **large platelets**, which is a characteristic feature of Bernard-Soulier disease.
4. **Coagulation test results**: The partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT) are normal, indicating that the coagulation cascade is not affected. The fibrinogen level is also normal.
5. **Platelet aggregation test with ristocetin**: This test is normal, which rules out Von Willebrand disease.
6. **Increased bleeding time**: This suggests a platelet function disorder, which is consistent with Bernard-Soulier disease.

Bernard-Soulier disease is a rare inherited platelet disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia, large platelets, and a defect in platelet adhesion due to a deficiency of the glycoprotein complex GPIb-IX-V. The symptoms and laboratory results in this patient are consistent with this diagnosis.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

A. Von Willebrand disease: The normal platelet aggregation test with ristocetin rules out this diagnosis.

B. Glanzmann's thrombasthenia: This disorder is characterized by a defect in platelet aggregation, which is not seen in this patient.

C. Aspirin: There is no history of aspirin use, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with aspirin-induced platelet dysfunction.

E. Scurvy: This vitamin C deficiency disorder can cause bleeding symptoms, but it is not consistent with the patient's laboratory results, particularly the elevated platelet count and large platelets on the blood smear.",Success
"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of dysuria and increased urinary frequency. Vital signs are within normal limits. Urinalysis shows cloudy, red urine. This patient's clinical presentation is best explained by an infection with a virus with which of the following features?",E,"The correct answer is A. Non-enveloped with linear, single-stranded DNA.

The patient's symptoms, such as dysuria and increased urinary frequency, are consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI). The urinalysis results showing cloudy, red urine suggest the presence of blood and inflammatory cells, which is also consistent with a UTI.

The most likely cause of this UTI in a 6-year-old boy is adenovirus, which is a non-enveloped virus with linear, single-stranded DNA. Adenovirus is a common cause of UTIs in children, particularly in boys. It can cause hemorrhagic cystitis, which is characterized by blood in the urine, dysuria, and frequency.

The other options are not correct because:

* B. Non-enveloped with linear, single-stranded RNA: This describes picornaviruses, such as enteroviruses, which are not typically associated with UTIs.
* C. Enveloped with linear, double-stranded DNA: This describes herpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus, which can cause UTIs, but are not typically associated with hemorrhagic cystitis.
* D. Enveloped with linear, single-stranded RNA: This describes coronaviruses and influenza viruses, which are not typically associated with UTIs.
* E. Non-enveloped with linear, double-stranded DNA: This does not describe any common viruses associated with UTIs.

It's worth noting that bacterial UTIs are more common than viral UTIs, and the symptoms and urinalysis results could also be consistent with a bacterial UTI. However, the question specifically asks about a viral infection, and adenovirus is the most likely cause based on the symptoms and characteristics described.",Success
"A 13-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician due to a left breast lump under his nipple. He noticed it last month and felt that it has increased slightly in size. It is tender to touch but has no overlying skin changes. There is no breast discharge. The patient has cryptorchidism as an infant and underwent a successful orchiopexy. In addition, he was recently diagnosed with ADHD and is currently on methylphenidate with improvement in his symptoms. He has a family history of type I diabetes in his father and breast fibroadenoma in his mother. On exam, the patient is at the 82nd percentile for height, 79th percentile for weight, and 80th percentile for BMI. He has tanner IV pubic hair. Testicular volume is 7 mL on each side, and both testes are smooth and freely mobile. Breast exam shows a normal right breast and a 3-centimeter round, firm, and slightly tender discrete mass under the left nipple. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Glandular tissue enlargement.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with gynecomastia, which is a benign enlargement of the male breast tissue. The presence of a firm, round, and slightly tender mass under the left nipple, along with normal testicular volume and pubic hair development, suggests that the patient is experiencing a normal pubertal growth spurt.

Gynecomastia is a common condition during puberty, affecting up to 60% of boys, and is often caused by an imbalance between estrogen and testosterone levels. During puberty, boys experience a surge in estrogen levels, which can stimulate breast tissue growth.

The patient's family history of breast fibroadenoma in his mother may also contribute to his risk of developing gynecomastia.

The other options are less likely:

A. Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects testicular development and function, leading to infertility and gynecomastia. However, the patient's testicular volume and pubic hair development are normal, making this diagnosis less likely.

C. Lipomastia (pseudogynecomastia) is a condition characterized by excess fatty tissue in the breast area, which is not consistent with the patient's physical examination findings.

D. Testicular cancer is unlikely given the patient's normal testicular examination and lack of other symptoms.

E. Medication side effect is also unlikely, as methylphenidate is not typically associated with gynecomastia as a side effect.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with gynecomastia caused by glandular tissue enlargement, which is a normal variant during puberty.",Success
"A 35-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency room with unilateral leg swelling. She reports that she developed painful left-sided leg swelling and redness earlier in the day. She is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. She denies any recent prolonged travel. She experienced a similar episode affecting the opposite leg one year ago and was diagnosed with a thrombus in the right femoral vein. On examination, the left leg is erythematous and swollen. Passive dorsiflexion of the left ankle elicits pain in the left calf. Ultrasound of the leg reveals a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. A genetic workup reveals that she has an inherited condition. What is the most likely pathophysiology of this patient’s condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Resistance to clotting factor degradation.

The patient's presentation with recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in different legs, along with the genetic workup, suggests an inherited thrombophilia. The most likely pathophysiology is resistance to activated protein C (APC), also known as factor V Leiden mutation. This is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to degrade clotting factor V, leading to an increased risk of thrombosis.

Factor V Leiden is the most common inherited thrombophilia, and it is characterized by a mutation in the factor V gene that makes it resistant to degradation by activated protein C. This leads to an increased risk of thrombosis, particularly in the deep veins of the legs.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:

A. Elevated serum homocysteine is associated with hyperhomocysteinemia, which is a risk factor for thrombosis, but it is not a direct cause of the patient's condition.

B. Thrombin inhibitor deficiency is not a recognized inherited thrombophilia.

C. Deficiency in protein C is an inherited thrombophilia, but it is less common than factor V Leiden mutation.

D. Auto-antibodies directed against phospholipids are associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, which is an autoimmune disorder that can cause thrombosis, but it is not an inherited thrombophilia.

It's worth noting that the patient's symptoms, such as unilateral leg swelling, pain, and erythema, are consistent with DVT, and the ultrasound finding of a thrombus in the left popliteal vein confirms the diagnosis. The patient's history of a similar episode in the opposite leg one year ago suggests a underlying thrombophilic disorder, which is supported by the genetic workup revealing an inherited condition.",Success
"A 78-year-old man is brought to the physician by his daughter because of increasing forgetfulness over the past 5 weeks. He had been living independently but came to live with his daughter temporarily after he complained that he was unable to perform some of his daily activities. He has left the front door wide open and tap water running on multiple occasions. He does not sleep well and wakes up 6–7 times during the night. He does not leave his room and rarely makes conversation with his daughter. He says that he used to enjoy playing the piano but has not played for several months. He has hypertension treated with amlodipine. Vital signs are within normal limits. Mental status examination shows orientation to person, place, and time and psychomotor retardation. He has a blunted affect. Short- and long-term memory is impaired. Attention and concentration are impaired. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum concentration of electrolytes, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and vitamin B12 are within the reference range. He is very concerned about his memory lapses. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is A. Donepezil.

The patient's symptoms, such as increasing forgetfulness, difficulty with daily activities, and impaired short- and long-term memory, are consistent with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The patient's concern about his memory lapses and the absence of other underlying medical conditions or reversible causes of dementia (e.g., hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency) support this diagnosis.

Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor, which is a first-line treatment for Alzheimer's disease. It has been shown to improve cognitive function, particularly in the areas of memory, attention, and communication, in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The patient's symptoms and diagnosis make donepezil the most appropriate treatment option.

Fluoxetine (option B) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant, which may be used to treat depression, but it is not a primary treatment for Alzheimer's disease.

Aspirin (option C) is an antiplatelet agent that may be used to prevent cardiovascular events, but it is not a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (option D) is a surgical procedure used to treat normal pressure hydrocephalus, which is a condition characterized by enlarged ventricles in the brain. While the patient's symptoms may be similar to those of normal pressure hydrocephalus, the absence of other characteristic features, such as gait disturbance and urinary incontinence, makes this diagnosis less likely.

Memantine (option E) is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that may be used to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease. While it may be a suitable treatment option, donepezil is generally considered a first-line treatment for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, making it the more appropriate choice for this patient.",Success
"A previously healthy 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for evaluation of an abdominal mass noticed a few days ago. He appears markedly pale and lethargic. Examination shows a 6-cm, nonmobile mass in the left upper quadrant that crosses the midline. 24-hour urine collection shows elevated homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid. Further evaluation including biopsy confirms the diagnosis of intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. The physician recommends the established standard treatment, which is initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, the likelihood of unresectability without neoadjuvant treatment, and the prognosis without it, the patient's parents steadily refuse chemotherapy because they do not want their son to suffer the side effects. They prefer to take their son home for supportive care only. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",D,"The correct answer is D. Seek a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Explanation:

In this scenario, the physician has diagnosed the child with intermediate-risk neuroblastoma and recommended the established standard treatment, which includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. The parents, however, refuse chemotherapy due to concerns about side effects and prefer to take their son home for supportive care only.

As a healthcare provider, it is essential to respect the parents' autonomy and decision-making capacity. However, in this case, the refusal of chemotherapy may result in significant harm or even death to the child. Neuroblastoma is a life-threatening condition that requires timely and appropriate treatment to ensure the best possible outcome.

Given the gravity of the situation, the most appropriate action by the physician is to seek a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Option D). This approach prioritizes the child's best interests and ensures that they receive the necessary treatment to combat the disease.

The other options are not suitable in this scenario:

A. Arranging supportive care at home (Option A) would not address the underlying condition and may lead to further deterioration of the child's health.

B. Referring the patient to another oncologist (Option B) may delay treatment and is unlikely to change the parents' decision.

C. Recommending that the parents take 2 weeks to think about their decision (Option C) may also delay treatment and is not a viable solution.

E. Attempting surgical resection of the tumor without neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Option E) is not the established standard treatment for intermediate-risk neuroblastoma and may not be effective in this case.

It is essential for healthcare providers to balance respect for parental autonomy with their duty to act in the best interests of the child. In this scenario, seeking a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the most appropriate course of action to ensure the child receives the necessary treatment.",Success
"A laboratory primarily involved with studying cellular proofreading mechanisms is investigating the question of whether the ribosome can recognize a mischarged amino acid and still be incorporated into the growing peptide. In order to do so, they biochemically charge a Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine and insert the tRNA into the cell. They design an mRNA sequence that contains only codons for lysine. Which of the following will most likely occur?",C,"The correct answer is C. The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specify for lysine.

Here's why:

In this experiment, the researchers have biochemically charged a Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine, which means the tRNA molecule is carrying the wrong amino acid (valine) but still has the correct anticodon that recognizes the lysine codon on the mRNA. When this mischarged tRNA is inserted into the cell, it will bind to the ribosome and recognize the lysine codon on the mRNA.

The ribosome does not have the ability to recognize a mischarged tRNA or check the identity of the amino acid attached to the tRNA. Its primary function is to read the mRNA sequence and match the codons with the corresponding tRNA molecules. Since the mischarged tRNA has the correct anticodon, it will be incorporated into the growing peptide chain at the position specified by the lysine codon.

Option A is incorrect because the ribosome does not have a mechanism to recognize and remove a mischarged tRNA. Option B is also incorrect because the ribosome will not terminate protein translation due to a mischarged tRNA. Option D is incorrect because the proteasome is involved in protein degradation, not tRNA degradation. Option E is incorrect because the lysyl-tRNA synthetase is the enzyme responsible for charging the tRNA with the correct amino acid (lysine), but it is not involved in removing a mischarged tRNA.",Success
"A 65-year-old man with metastatic lung cancer has been experiencing severe, unremitting pain. He has required escalating doses of oral morphine, but is now having dose limiting side-effects. His pain management team recommends using a medication that can reduce his opioid need through interaction with the NMDA-receptor. Which of the following was the most likely recommended agent?",B,"The correct answer is B. Ketamine.

Here's why:

The patient is experiencing severe, unremitting pain and is requiring escalating doses of oral morphine, but is now experiencing dose-limiting side effects. The pain management team recommends using a medication that can reduce his opioid need through interaction with the NMDA-receptor. This suggests that they are looking for an agent that can potentiate the analgesic effects of opioids while reducing the required dose, thereby minimizing side effects.

Ketamine is a medication that acts as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. It has been shown to have analgesic properties, particularly in the management of chronic pain, and can reduce opioid requirements. By blocking the NMDA receptor, ketamine can decrease the development of opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia, allowing for better pain control with lower doses of opioids.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Propofol is an anesthetic agent, not typically used for pain management.

C. Fentanyl is an opioid, which would not reduce opioid need.

D. Ketorolac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), which may be used for pain management, but it does not interact with the NMDA receptor.

E. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine, typically used for sedation and anxiety, not pain management.

It's worth noting that ketamine is often used in subanesthetic doses for pain management, and its use in this context is supported by evidence-based guidelines.",Success

Although he tried several pain medications, none of the pain medications helped. He is an amateur tennis player who practices on weekends. He denies any trauma during his practice sessions. On examination of the shoulder joint, severe tenderness was present localized to the greater tuberosity of the left shoulder joint along with biceps tendon tenderness over the bicipital groove. The range of motion was limited to the left side. An X-ray of the joint showed narrowing of the acromiohumeral space with sclerosis and spurring of the acromion. Routine blood test results are normal except for the rheumatoid factor, which is positive. What is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Rotator cuff injury.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as shoulder pain that worsens when sleeping on the left side, are consistent with a rotator cuff injury.
* The physical examination findings of tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the left shoulder joint and biceps tendon tenderness over the bicipital groove also support this diagnosis.
* The X-ray findings of narrowing of the acromiohumeral space with sclerosis and spurring of the acromion are indicative of chronic rotator cuff tendinopathy or tears.
* The patient's history of being an amateur tennis player who practices on weekends suggests repetitive strain or overuse injury to the rotator cuff muscles.
* Although the rheumatoid factor is positive, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are not consistent with rheumatoid arthritis, which typically presents with symmetric polyarthritis, morning stiffness, and systemic symptoms.
* Trauma (Option A) is unlikely given the patient's denial of any traumatic event during tennis practice.
* Referred pain from the neck and back (Option B) is also unlikely given the localized tenderness and X-ray findings specific to the shoulder joint.
* Osteoarthritis (Option D) is possible, but the patient's age and lack of systemic symptoms make it less likely.

She says that she has been very stressed with school and has recently been binge eating. What other finding do you expect to see in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Erosion of tooth enamel.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest Bulimia Nervosa, a eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by purging or compensatory behaviors. The patient's history of binge eating, enlarged cheeks (likely due to parotid gland hypertrophy), and calluses on the dorsum of her hands (Russell's sign) support this diagnosis.

Erosion of tooth enamel is a common finding in patients with bulimia nervosa due to the frequent exposure of teeth to stomach acid during self-induced vomiting. This can lead to dental erosion, particularly on the lingual surfaces of the teeth.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Malar rash is a characteristic finding in systemic lupus erythematosus, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms.

B. Increased blood glucose level may be seen in patients with diabetes, but there is no indication of this in the patient's history or physical examination.

D. Enlarged thyroid is not a typical finding in bulimia nervosa, and the patient's symptoms do not suggest a thyroid disorder.

E. Elevated estrogen levels are not expected in this patient, as amenorrhea (the absence of menstruation) is often seen in women with bulimia nervosa due to hormonal imbalances, particularly low estrogen levels.

It's essential to note that a thorough evaluation, including a psychological assessment, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of bulimia nervosa and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms.",Success

He is unsure of any clear precipitating factors but thinks they may occur more often around important exams or when big school projects are due. He shares that, as these episodes continue to recur, he has had mounting anxiety about having one when he is in class or at a restaurant. As a result, he is leaving the house less and less. He has no past medical history; the physical exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is the best medication for the long-term management of this patient's condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Citalopram.

Based on the patient's symptoms, the diagnosis is likely panic disorder. The patient is experiencing recurrent panic attacks, characterized by chest discomfort, shortness of breath, shakiness, and sweating, which are triggered by stressors such as important exams or big school projects. The patient's anxiety about having a panic attack in public has led to avoidance behaviors, such as leaving the house less and less.

Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is commonly used as a first-line treatment for panic disorder. SSRIs have been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of panic attacks, as well as alleviating anxiety and depressive symptoms associated with panic disorder.

Lithium (B) is typically used to treat bipolar disorder, not panic disorder. Lorazepam (C) is a benzodiazepine that can be used as a short-term treatment for panic disorder, but it is not recommended for long-term management due to the risk of dependence and withdrawal. Propranolol (D) is a beta blocker that can be used to treat performance anxiety, but it is not typically used to treat panic disorder.

"A stillborn infant is delivered at 38 weeks' gestation to a 32-year-old woman. The mother had no prenatal care. Examination of the stillborn shows a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet. An x-ray shows the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Maternal diabetes.

The description of the stillborn infant's physical examination and x-ray findings is consistent with a diagnosis of caudal regression syndrome (CRS), a rare congenital anomaly characterized by abnormalities of the lower spine, pelvis, and limbs. CRS is strongly associated with maternal diabetes, particularly when the diabetes is poorly controlled during pregnancy.

Studies have shown that the risk of CRS is significantly increased in infants of mothers with pregestational diabetes, with a reported incidence of 1-2% compared to 0.01-0.05% in the general population. The exact mechanism by which maternal diabetes contributes to CRS is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve abnormal embryonic development and vascular disruption.

The other options are not as strongly associated with CRS:

A. Maternal oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid) is not a known risk factor for CRS.

B. Intrauterine alcohol exposure is a teratogen that can cause a range of congenital anomalies, but it is not specifically associated with CRS.

C. Chromosome 13 trisomy (Patau syndrome) is a genetic disorder that can cause various congenital anomalies, but it is not typically associated with CRS.

The authors of the study have decided to conduct a follow-up analysis on their data. They decide to stratify their results by CD4+T-lymphocyte count at the time of diagnosis. Among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, cART adherence was a significant predictor of DLBCL risk (RR = 0.52, p = 0.01). However, among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3, no relationship was found between DLBCL risk and cART adherence (RR = 0.96, p = 0.36). Which of the following explains for the difference observed between the two strata?""",E,"The correct answer is E. Effect modification.

The difference in the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk between the two strata (CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3 and above 200/mm3) suggests that the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk is modified by the CD4+ cell count at the time of diagnosis. In other words, the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk is different depending on the level of CD4+ cell count.

Effect modification occurs when the effect of a variable (in this case, cART adherence) on an outcome (DLBCL risk) is different depending on the level of another variable (CD4+ cell count). This is a common phenomenon in epidemiology and is often identified through stratified analysis, as done in this study.

The other options do not explain the difference observed between the two strata:

A. Poor generalizability refers to the limitation of a study's findings to a specific population or context, which is not relevant to the difference observed between the two strata.

B. Stratified sampling refers to a sampling method where the population is divided into subgroups based on certain characteristics, but this is not the reason for the difference observed between the two strata.

C. Random error refers to the chance variation in the data, which would not result in a systematic difference between the two strata.

D. Systematic error refers to a bias in the data collection or measurement process, which would also not result in a systematic difference between the two strata.

Therefore, the correct answer is E. Effect modification.",Success
"During a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, Th1 cells secrete a factor capable of stimulating phagosome-lysosome fusion within macrophages. In addition, the secreted factors help activate macrophages to produce mediators such as NO, which are capable of destroying the invading pathogen. Furthermore, activation of the macrophages by the secreted factor eventually leads to the formation of a tubercle. Which of the following factors is secreted by Th1 cells and responsible for these actions?",C,"The correct answer is C. IFN-gamma.

Here's why:

During a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, Th1 cells play a crucial role in activating macrophages to combat the infection. One of the key factors secreted by Th1 cells is Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), which is responsible for stimulating phagosome-lysosome fusion within macrophages. This fusion enables the macrophages to digest and eliminate the ingested bacteria.

IFN-gamma also activates macrophages to produce mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), which is toxic to M. tuberculosis and helps to destroy the invading pathogen. Additionally, the activation of macrophages by IFN-gamma leads to the formation of a tubercle, a characteristic granuloma that is a hallmark of tuberculosis.

The other options are not correct:

A. IL-4 is a cytokine secreted by Th2 cells, which is involved in allergic responses and humoral immunity, but not in the activation of macrophages against M. tuberculosis.

B. TNF-alpha is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in the immune response, but it is not specifically responsible for stimulating phagosome-lysosome fusion or activating macrophages against M. tuberculosis.

D. Histamine is a mediator released from mast cells and basophils, involved in allergic reactions, but not in the immune response to M. tuberculosis.

E. IL-17 is a cytokine involved in the recruitment of neutrophils and the development of autoimmune diseases, but it is not directly involved in the activation of macrophages against M. tuberculosis.

Current medical guidelines and research support the role of IFN-gamma in the immune response to M. tuberculosis, making option C the correct answer.",Success
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician because of abdominal pain and constipation for 3 weeks. His mother says he has been increasingly irritable recently. His vocabulary consists of 50 words and he does not use sentences. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae and abdominal tenderness. He refers to himself by name but is unable to name body parts or count to three. Peripheral blood smear shows small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling. Which of the following processes is most likely impaired in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of lead poisoning. The presence of basophilic stippling on the peripheral blood smear is a characteristic feature of lead toxicity. Lead inhibits the enzyme δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), which is necessary for the conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen in the heme biosynthetic pathway. This inhibition leads to the accumulation of δ-aminolevulinic acid and the formation of basophilic stippling in red blood cells.

The other options are not directly related to lead poisoning:

A. Conversion of ferrous iron to ferric iron is a process involved in iron metabolism, but it is not specifically related to lead poisoning.

B. Conversion of porphobilinogen to hydroxymethylbilane is a step in the heme biosynthetic pathway, but it is not the step inhibited by lead.

D. Conversion of homocysteine to methionine is a process involved in methionine metabolism, which is not directly related to lead poisoning.

E. Conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III is a step in the heme biosynthetic pathway, but it is not the step inhibited by lead.

It's worth noting that lead poisoning can cause a range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, constipation, and developmental delays, which are consistent with the patient's presentation.",Success
"A group of researchers conducted a study to determine whether there is an association between folic acid supplementation before pregnancy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. The researchers retrospectively surveyed 200 mothers with children diagnosed with ASD during the first 4 years of life and 200 mothers with healthy children. All participants were interviewed about their prenatal consumption of folic acid using standardized questionnaires. A 94% response rate was obtained from the surveys. The study ultimately found that folic acid supplementation was associated with lower rates of ASD in offspring (OR = 0.3, p < 0.01). Which of the following type of bias is most likely to have influenced these results?",C,"The correct answer is C. Recall bias.

Recall bias occurs when participants in a study (in this case, the mothers) have different abilities to recall past events or exposures (in this case, folic acid supplementation during pregnancy). This can lead to inaccurate or incomplete reporting, which can influence the study's results.

In this study, the researchers relied on maternal recall of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy, which may be subject to recall bias. Mothers of children with ASD may be more likely to remember or report not taking folic acid supplements, while mothers of healthy children may be more likely to remember or report taking them. This could lead to an overestimation of the association between folic acid supplementation and lower rates of ASD.

Interviewer bias (A) is unlikely, as the study used standardized questionnaires, which reduces the risk of interviewer influence. Latency period (B) refers to the time between exposure and disease onset, which is not directly relevant to this study. Survival bias (D) occurs when participants who survive a certain period are more likely to be included in the study, which is not applicable here. Length-time bias (E) refers to the phenomenon where faster-growing or more aggressive diseases are more likely to be detected, which is not relevant to this study.

It's worth noting that recall bias can be a significant limitation in retrospective studies like this one, and the researchers should consider using additional methods to validate the mothers' reports, such as reviewing medical records or using biomarkers, to increase the accuracy of their findings.",Success
"A student studying pharmacology is a member of a team that is conducting research related to the elimination of multiple anticoagulant medications. His duty as a member of the team is to collect serum samples of the subjects every 4 hours and send them for analysis of serum drug levels. He is also supposed to collect, document and analyze the data. For one of the subjects, he notices that the subject is eliminating 0.5 mg of the drug every 4 hours. Which of the following anticoagulants did this patient most likely consume?",A,"The correct answer is C. Dabigatran.

Here's why:

Dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, and its elimination half-life is around 12-14 hours. It is primarily eliminated by the kidneys, with approximately 80% of the dose excreted unchanged in the urine. The rate of elimination is relatively consistent, with a linear decrease in serum levels over time.

The scenario described, where the subject is eliminating 0.5 mg of the drug every 4 hours, is consistent with the pharmacokinetic profile of dabigatran. This rate of elimination is plausible for dabigatran, given its half-life and renal elimination.

In contrast:

* Warfarin (A) is a vitamin K antagonist with a long half-life (around 36-48 hours) and a complex elimination profile, making it unlikely to exhibit a consistent 0.5 mg elimination every 4 hours.
* Enoxaparin (B) is a low-molecular-weight heparin, which is primarily eliminated through renal excretion, but its half-life is around 4-5 hours, and its elimination profile is not consistent with the described scenario.
* Fondaparinux (D) is a synthetic pentasaccharide, which is also eliminated through renal excretion, but its half-life is around 17-21 hours, and its elimination profile is not consistent with the described scenario.
* Apixaban (E) is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor, which is eliminated through a combination of renal and hepatic mechanisms, with a half-life around 12 hours. While its elimination profile is more consistent with the described scenario than the other options, it is still less likely than dabigatran to exhibit a consistent 0.5 mg elimination every 4 hours.

Therefore, based on the pharmacokinetic profiles of these anticoagulants, dabigatran is the most likely culprit.",Success
"A 40-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a checkup. She has felt weaker lately and has lost some weight. She denies any urinary issues. Her BUN at her last visit 4 months ago was 45 mg/dL, and her creatinine was 2.0 mg/dL. Her laboratory studies this visit are seen below:

Hemoglobin: 8 g/dL
Hematocrit: 29%
Leukocyte count: 9,500/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 197,000/mm^3

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 5.9 mEq/L
HCO3-: 17 mEq/L
BUN: 59 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 2.3 mg/dL
Ca2+: 9.0 mg/dL

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Chronic kidney failure.

Here's why:

The patient's laboratory results show a progressive decline in renal function over the past 4 months, with an increase in BUN (from 45 mg/dL to 59 mg/dL) and creatinine (from 2.0 mg/dL to 2.3 mg/dL). This suggests chronic kidney disease (CKD) rather than acute kidney injury.

The patient's anemia (hemoglobin 8 g/dL, hematocrit 29%) is also consistent with CKD, as the kidneys play a role in erythropoiesis. The normal leukocyte count and differential rule out infection, making options B (ascending pyelonephritis) and D (obstructive uropathy) less likely.

There is no evidence of urinary issues or symptoms suggestive of obstruction, making option D (obstructive uropathy) unlikely. Option E (renal cell carcinoma) is not supported by the laboratory results, and cancer would not typically cause a gradual decline in renal function over 4 months.

Option A (acute kidney failure) is also unlikely, as the patient's creatinine has been elevated for at least 4 months, and there is no evidence of a sudden insult to the kidneys.

The patient's hyperkalemia (K+ 5.9 mEq/L) and metabolic acidosis (HCO3- 17 mEq/L) are also consistent with CKD, as the kidneys play a critical role in potassium and acid-base regulation.

Overall, the patient's laboratory results and clinical presentation are most consistent with chronic kidney failure.",Success
"A 28-year-old woman comes to the obstetrics and gynecology clinic because she has been unsuccessfully trying to conceive with her husband for the last 2 years. He has had 2 children from a previous marriage and has been tested for causes of male infertility. She has had prior abdominal surgery as well as a family history of endocrine abnormalities. Based on this history, a panel of tests are obtained and treatment is started. This treatment will be administered intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle. If the most likely drug prescribed in this case was administered in a different manner, which of the following conditions may also be treated by this drug?",E,"The correct answer is C. Polycystic ovarian syndrome.

Based on the patient's history of infertility, prior abdominal surgery, and family history of endocrine abnormalities, the most likely drug prescribed is clomiphene citrate (Clomid). Clomiphene is an ovulation inducer commonly used to treat infertility in women with ovulatory dysfunction, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

In this scenario, clomiphene is administered intermittently one week before the patient's normal menstrual cycle to stimulate ovulation. However, if clomiphene were administered in a different manner, such as continuously, it may also be used to treat PCOS, as it can help regulate menstrual cycles and improve fertility in women with PCOS.

The other options are not directly related to the use of clomiphene citrate:

A. Diabetes: Clomiphene is not used to treat diabetes.

B. Parkinson disease: Clomiphene is not used to treat Parkinson disease.

D. Premature labor: Clomiphene is not used to treat premature labor.

E. Prostate cancer: Clomiphene is not used to treat prostate cancer.

It's essential to note that clomiphene citrate is typically prescribed and monitored by a healthcare provider, and its use should be individualized based on the patient's specific medical history and needs.",Success
A 2-year-old girl with recurrent urinary tract infections is brought to the physician for a follow-up examination. Renal ultrasound shows bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis. A voiding cystourethrography shows retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition. Histologic examination of a kidney biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?,D,"The correct answer is D. Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy.

The patient's symptoms and test results are consistent with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), a condition in which urine flows backward from the bladder into the ureters and kidneys, causing recurrent urinary tract infections and kidney damage. The renal ultrasound shows bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis, which is a common finding in VUR. The voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) confirms the diagnosis by showing retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition.

Histologic examination of a kidney biopsy specimen in a patient with VUR would likely show cortical thinning with tubular atrophy, which is a result of chronic kidney damage caused by the reflux of infected urine into the kidneys. This damage can lead to scarring and loss of functional renal tissue.

The other options are not directly related to VUR or the patient's symptoms:

A. Diffuse interstitial infiltration with T lymphocytes is more characteristic of acute interstitial nephritis, an inflammatory condition that can be caused by various factors, including infections, medications, or autoimmune disorders.

B. Glomerular crescents with macrophages are typically seen in glomerulonephritis, a type of kidney inflammation that can be caused by various factors, including infections, autoimmune disorders, or vasculitis.

C. Matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation is more characteristic of mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, a type of kidney disease that can be caused by various factors, including infections, autoimmune disorders, or genetic defects.

E. Thickened glomerular capillary loops are typically seen in membranous nephropathy, a type of kidney disease that can be caused by various factors, including autoimmune disorders, infections, or cancer.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely histologic finding in a kidney biopsy specimen would be cortical thinning with tubular atrophy, which is a result of chronic kidney damage caused by VUR.",Success
"An unconscious 55-year-old man is brought to the Emergency Department by ambulance. He had recently lost his job and his house was about to begin foreclosure.

There were several empty bottles of vodka around him and one half empty container of antifreeze. A review of his medical records reveals that he was previously in good health. Upon arrival to the ED he regains consciousness.  His blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg, heart rate 120/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F). On physical exam his speech is slurred and he has difficulty following commands. His abdomen is diffusely tender to palpation with no rebound tenderness. Initial laboratory tests show an elevated serum creatinine (Cr) of 1.9 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 29 mg/dL. Which of the following findings would be expected in this patient’s urine?",B,"The correct answer is B. Calcium oxalate crystals.

The patient's history and laboratory results suggest ethylene glycol (antifreeze) poisoning. Ethylene glycol is metabolized to oxalic acid, which can cause acute kidney injury and crystalluria. Calcium oxalate crystals are a characteristic finding in the urine of patients with ethylene glycol poisoning.

Eosinophilia (A) is not typically associated with ethylene glycol poisoning. Hyaline casts (C) are a nonspecific finding that can be seen in various conditions, including urinary tract infections and kidney disease. Urine ketones (D) may be present in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis or starvation, but they are not typically associated with ethylene glycol poisoning. Urate crystals (E) are more commonly seen in patients with gout or kidney stones.

It's worth noting that the patient's abdominal tenderness and slurred speech may be related to the effects of ethanol (vodka) intoxication, but the elevated creatinine and BUN levels, as well as the presence of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine, are more consistent with ethylene glycol poisoning.",Success
"A 17-year-old girl comes to the physician because of an 8-month history of severe acne vulgaris over her face, upper back, arms, and buttocks. Treatment with oral antibiotics and topical combination therapy with benzoyl peroxide and retinoid has not completely resolved her symptoms.

This medication decreases the patient's risk developing of which of the following conditions?",B,"The correct answer is B. Ovarian cancer.

The patient is being treated with combined oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for acne vulgaris. OCPs have been shown to decrease the risk of ovarian cancer in women. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the use of OCPs for at least 5 years reduced the risk of ovarian cancer by 50% (1).

The other options are not directly related to the use of OCPs for acne treatment:

A. Hypertension: While OCPs can increase blood pressure in some women, they do not decrease the risk of hypertension.

C. Malignant melanoma: There is no established link between OCP use and the risk of malignant melanoma.

D. Cervical cancer: OCPs do not have a protective effect against cervical cancer. In fact, some studies suggest that long-term use of OCPs may increase the risk of cervical cancer (2).

E. Breast cancer: The relationship between OCP use and breast cancer risk is complex and controversial. While some studies suggest a small increase in breast cancer risk with OCP use, others have found no association (3).

"A 48-year-old female presents for a follow-up appointment to discuss her ultrasound results. She presented with a lump in her neck 2 weeks ago. On examination, a thyroid nodule was present; the nodule was fixed, immobile, and non-tender. Ultrasound showed a hypoechoic nodule with a size of 2 cm. Histological examination of a fine needle biopsy was performed and cytological examination reported a likely suspicion of neoplasia. CT scan is performed to check for any lesions in the bones and/or lungs, common metastatic sites in this condition. Treatment with radioiodine therapy is planned after near-total thyroidectomy. Considering this tumor, which of the following is the most likely initial metastatic site in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is C. Cervical lymph nodes.

The patient's presentation and ultrasound findings suggest a thyroid nodule, which was further confirmed by a fine needle biopsy showing a likely suspicion of neoplasia. The planned treatment with near-total thyroidectomy and radioiodine therapy also supports the diagnosis of thyroid cancer.

Thyroid cancer, particularly papillary thyroid carcinoma, which is the most common type, often metastasizes to cervical lymph nodes. In fact, cervical lymph node metastasis is a common presentation of thyroid cancer, and it is estimated that up to 50% of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma have cervical lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis.

The other options are not as likely to be the initial metastatic site:

A. Trachea: While thyroid cancer can invade the trachea, it is not a common site for initial metastasis.

On presentation, his temperature is 102°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 126/81 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, and respirations are 13/min. Physical exam reveals a nontender swelling of the right eyelid, lymphadenopathy, and an indurated red patch with surrounding erythema and local swelling on his left leg. Which of the following drugs should be used to treat this patient's condition?",A,"The correct answer is E. Sodium stibogluconate.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the likely diagnosis is cutaneous leishmaniasis, a parasitic infection caused by Leishmania parasites. The patient's travel history to endemic regions (Thailand, Ethiopia, and Brazil) and the presence of a painless swelling of the right eyelid, lymphadenopathy, and an indurated red patch with surrounding erythema and local swelling on his left leg support this diagnosis.

Sodium stibogluconate is an antimonial medication that is commonly used to treat cutaneous leishmaniasis. It is effective against the Leishmania parasite and has been shown to be safe and effective in treating this condition.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Benznidazole is used to treat Chagas disease, a parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi.

B. Diethylcarbamazine is used to treat lymphatic filariasis, a parasitic infection caused by Wuchereria bancrofti.

A 10-year-old Caucasian female with Turner's syndrome underwent an abdominal imaging study and was discovered that the poles of her kidneys were fused inferiorly. Normal ascension of kidney during embryological development would be prevented by which of the following anatomical structures?,C,"The correct answer is B. Superior mesenteric artery.

During embryological development, the kidneys ascend from the pelvis to their final position in the lumbar region. Normally, the kidneys rotate and ascend upwards, but in this case, the poles of the kidneys are fused inferiorly, indicating a failure of normal ascension.

The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is the anatomical structure that would prevent normal ascension of the kidney. The SMA arises from the abdominal aorta and crosses the midline, anterior to the third part of the duodenum. During embryonic development, the SMA acts as a barrier, preventing the kidneys from ascending further cranially. If the kidneys fail to ascend above the SMA, they may fuse inferiorly, resulting in a horseshoe kidney, as seen in this patient with Turner's syndrome.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Inferior vena cava: Although the inferior vena cava is a major blood vessel in the abdominal cavity, it does not play a significant role in preventing kidney ascension.

C. Inferior mesenteric artery: This artery arises from the abdominal aorta and supplies the hindgut, but it is not involved in kidney ascension.

D. Celiac artery: The celiac artery arises from the abdominal aorta and supplies the foregut, but it is not related to kidney ascension.

E. Splenic artery: The splenic artery arises from the celiac artery and supplies the spleen, but it is not involved in kidney ascension.

It's essential to note that horseshoe kidney is a common congenital anomaly, and Turner's syndrome is a genetic disorder that can increase the risk of horseshoe kidney.",Success

A FAST and abdominal CT are promptly obtained which are demonstrated in Figures A and B, respectively. Her chart demonstrates no other medical problems and vaccinations/boosters up to date. The patient is diagnosed with a Grade V splenic laceration and is immediately brought to the OR for emergent splenectomy. The splenectomy is successfully performed with removal of the damaged spleen (Figure C). Following the operation, the patient should receive which of the following vaccines: (I) H. influenzae (II) Tetanus (III) N. meningitidis (IV) S. pneumoniae (V) Hepatitis B",B,"The correct answer is B. I, III, IV.

After a splenectomy, the patient is at increased risk of infections, particularly with encapsulated bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. This is because the spleen plays a crucial role in removing encapsulated bacteria from the bloodstream.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommend that patients who have undergone a splenectomy receive vaccinations against these encapsulated bacteria.

* Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccination (Option I) is recommended to protect against Hib infections, which can be severe and life-threatening in asplenic individuals.
* Neisseria meningitidis vaccination (Option III) is recommended to protect against meningococcal infections, which can be rapidly fatal in asplenic individuals.
* Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccination (Option IV) is recommended to protect against pneumococcal infections, which can be severe and life-threatening in asplenic individuals.

Tetanus vaccination (Option II) is not specifically recommended for patients who have undergone a splenectomy, as it is not related to the increased risk of infections associated with asplenia.

Hepatitis B vaccination (Option V) is not relevant to the patient's current condition and is not recommended in this scenario.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. I, III, IV, as these vaccines are specifically recommended to protect against infections that are more likely to occur in individuals without a spleen.",Success
"Researchers are studying the inheritance pattern of mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene, the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. It is believed that, in addition to the commonly found ΔF508 mutation, a novel mutation in this gene is found in a particular population under study. Which of the following would most likely suggest that these two loci have a high probability of being closely linked?",D,"The correct answer is D. LOD Score > 3.

Linkage analysis is a statistical method used to determine whether two genetic loci (in this case, the ΔF508 mutation and the novel mutation) are closely linked, meaning they are physically close together on the same chromosome. The LOD (Logarithm of Odds) score is a measure of the likelihood of linkage between two loci.

A LOD score greater than 3 is generally considered to be strong evidence for linkage, indicating that the two loci are likely to be closely linked. This is because a LOD score of 3 corresponds to a likelihood ratio of 1000:1 in favor of linkage, which is a commonly accepted threshold for declaring linkage.

In contrast, a LOD score less than 1, 2, or 3 would suggest that the evidence for linkage is weak or inconclusive. A LOD score of 0 would indicate no evidence for linkage.

Therefore, if the researchers find a LOD score greater than 3, it would suggest that the ΔF508 mutation and the novel mutation have a high probability of being closely linked.",Success

Her past medical, family, and social histories are all non-contributory. Which of the following is the appropriate management of a newly diagnosed CIN I in a 24-year-old patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Close observation, pap smear screening at 6 and 12 months, and HPV DNA testing at 12 months.

According to the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) guidelines, the management of CIN I in a 24-year-old patient (or in this case, a 28-year-old patient) involves close observation with serial Pap smears and HPV DNA testing. This approach is recommended because CIN I is a low-grade lesion that often regresses spontaneously, and aggressive treatment may not be necessary.

The ASCCP guidelines recommend the following management strategy for CIN I:

* Repeat Pap smear at 6 and 12 months
* Perform HPV DNA testing at 12 months
* If the Pap smear is normal and HPV DNA testing is negative at 12 months, return to routine screening
* If the Pap smear is abnormal or HPV DNA testing is positive at 12 months, colposcopy is recommended

The other options are not appropriate for the management of CIN I in a 24-year-old patient:

* B. Cryotherapy ablation and C. Laser ablation are treatments for CIN II and CIN III, which are higher-grade lesions that require more aggressive management.
* D. Loop electrosurgical excision (LEEP) is a treatment for CIN II and CIN III, and may be considered for CIN I if the lesion is persistent or if the patient has other risk factors.
* E. Hysterectomy is not a recommended treatment for CIN I, as it is a low-grade lesion that can be managed with less invasive approaches.

It's essential to reassure the patient that CIN I is a common and treatable condition, and that close observation with serial Pap smears and HPV DNA testing is a reasonable approach to manage the lesion.",Success

A new drug called DN501 is developed with the same mechanism of action as darunavir but fewer side effects. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of DN501?",B,"The correct answer is C. Inhibits integration of viral genome into the host cell.

Darunavir is a protease inhibitor, which means it works by inhibiting the protease enzyme that HIV uses to cleave its polyproteins into functional proteins. However, darunavir's mechanism of action is not among the options provided.

Given that DN501 has the same mechanism of action as darunavir, we can infer that it is also a protease inhibitor. Protease inhibitors prevent the integration of the viral genome into the host cell by inhibiting the protease enzyme, which is necessary for the virus to replicate.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Prevents viral transcription: This is the mechanism of action of reverse transcriptase inhibitors, such as nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs).

B. Inhibits viral assembly: This is not a specific mechanism of action of any HIV medication.

D. Inhibits viral entry: This is the mechanism of action of entry inhibitors, such as maraviroc.

E. Prevents T-cell binding: This is not a specific mechanism of action of any HIV medication.

Examination of the oral cavity shows a single ulcer near the vermillion border. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,A,"The correct answer is A. Squamous cell carcinoma.

Here's why:

* The patient's age, smoking history, and occupation as a fruit picker (exposing him to UV radiation) increase his risk for developing squamous cell carcinoma.
* The presence of a painless ulcer near the vermillion border of the lower lip is consistent with squamous cell carcinoma, which often presents as a painless, non-healing ulcer or lesion in the oral cavity.
* The patient's history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus does not directly relate to the oral lesion, and his medications (captopril and metformin) are not typically associated with oral ulcers.

In contrast:

* Herpes labialis (B) typically presents with painful, grouped vesicles or ulcers, often accompanied by systemic symptoms like fever and lymphadenopathy, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.
* Aphthous stomatitis (C) is a common condition characterized by recurrent, painful ulcers in the oral cavity, but it is not typically associated with a single, painless ulcer near the vermillion border.
* Actinic keratosis (D) is a precancerous skin lesion that can occur on sun-exposed areas, but it is not typically found on the lip or in the oral cavity.
* Traumatic ulcer (E) is a possibility, but the patient's history does not suggest any recent trauma to the lip, and the lesion has been present for 3 months, making it less likely to be a traumatic ulcer.

"An investigator is studying the effect of drug X on the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene on chromosome 13 in endometrial cells. Endometrial cells obtained from study participants are plated on growth media and the distribution of cell cycle phase is measured with flow cytometry. Drug X, which is known to activate cyclin-dependent kinase 4, is administered to all the cells, and the distribution of cell cycle phase is measured again 1 hour later. Which of the following is most likely to result from the action of drug X on the Rb gene?",C,"The correct answer is C. Initiation of S phase.

Here's why:

The Rb gene is a tumor suppressor gene that regulates the cell cycle by inhibiting the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. When the Rb gene is functional, it prevents the cell from entering the S phase prematurely. However, when the Rb gene is inactivated or phosphorylated, it releases its inhibition on the cell cycle, allowing the cell to progress from the G1 phase to the S phase.

Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) is an enzyme that phosphorylates and inactivates the Rb gene, thereby promoting the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase. Since drug X activates CDK4, it will phosphorylate and inactivate the Rb gene, leading to the initiation of the S phase.

The other options are not correct because:

A. G1 phase arrest would occur if the Rb gene were activated, not inactivated.

B. Prophase I arrest is not related to the Rb gene or CDK4.

D. Completion of G2 phase is not directly related to the action of drug X on the Rb gene.

E. Initiation of G0 phase is not a possible outcome, as G0 is a quiescent phase, and the action of drug X would promote cell cycle progression, not quiescence.

"A 65-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck over the past week. He also says he has been having intermittent fevers and severe night sweats which require a change of bed sheets the next day. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosed 10 years ago with which he admits to not always being compliant with his antiretroviral medication. The patient reports a 20-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a 6 kg (13.2 lb) unintentional weight loss over the past 2 months. The vital signs include: temperature 37.8℃ (100.0℉) and blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, there are multiple non-tender swollen lymph nodes averaging 2 cm in diameter that is palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. Axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present on the right side. A cardiopulmonary exam is unremarkable. The spleen size is 16 cm on percussion. Laboratory studies show the following:
Hemoglobin 9 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 88 μm3
Leukocyte count 18,000/mm3
Platelet count 130,000/mm3
    Serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL
Serum lactate dehydrogenase 1,000 U/L
An excisional biopsy of a superficial axillary lymph node on the right is performed and a histopathologic analysis confirms the most likely diagnosis. Which of the following is the next best diagnostic step in the workup of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is D. Peripheral blood flow cytometry.

Here's why:

Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), specifically diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The excisional biopsy of the axillary lymph node confirms this diagnosis.

The next step in the workup would be to determine the extent of disease and assess for bone marrow involvement. Peripheral blood flow cytometry is a diagnostic test that can help identify abnormal cells in the blood and bone marrow, which is essential in staging and managing NHL.

The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis or staging of NHL:

A. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) is a test for autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, which is not relevant to this patient's presentation.

B. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies may be relevant in the context of HIV infection, but it is not a priority in this patient's workup.

C. JAK-2 mutation is a genetic test for myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as polycythemia vera, which is not suspected in this patient.

E. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test is a diagnostic test for hairy cell leukemia, which is not consistent with this patient's presentation and biopsy results.

In summary, peripheral blood flow cytometry is the next best diagnostic step to determine the extent of disease and assess for bone marrow involvement in this patient with NHL.",Success
"In order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?",E,"The correct answer is A. Lack of a comparison group.

The journal editor suggested that the study should be submitted as a case series instead of a cohort study because it lacks a comparison group. A cohort study typically involves comparing two or more groups of patients, such as a treatment group and a control group, to assess the effect of a particular intervention or exposure on outcomes. In this study, the authors only followed a single group of 14 patients who underwent cerclage wiring for femur fractures, without a control group or comparison group.

A case series, on the other hand, is a type of observational study that involves reporting on a series of patients with a particular condition or treatment, without a control group or comparison group. Since the study only reports on the outcomes of the 14 patients who underwent cerclage wiring, without comparing them to a control group, it is more accurately classified as a case series.

The other options are not correct reasons for the editor's suggestion:

B. No prevalence assessment: The study is not assessing the prevalence of a condition, but rather evaluating the outcomes of a specific treatment approach.

C. Low number of patients: While the sample size is small, it is not the primary reason for the editor's suggestion.

D. Ascertainment bias: There is no indication of ascertainment bias in the study, which refers to a systematic error in the selection or measurement of patients.

E. Lack of risk calculation: The study does report on the outcomes and complications of the treatment, so it is not lacking in risk calculation.",Success
"A 67-year-old woman presents from home hospice with a change in her mental status. She has seemed more confused lately and is unable to verbalize her symptoms. Her temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 117/65 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a right upper quadrant mass that elicits discomfort when palpated. Ultrasound is notable for pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder wall thickening without any gallstones. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Acalculous cholecystitis.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation with a change in mental status, fever, and right upper quadrant (RUQ) tenderness suggests an acute inflammatory process in the abdomen. The ultrasound findings of pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder wall thickening are consistent with acute cholecystitis. The absence of gallstones on ultrasound makes option B (calculous cholecystitis) less likely.

Acalculous cholecystitis (option A) is a type of acute cholecystitis that occurs in the absence of gallstones. It is more common in critically ill patients, those with severe trauma, or those who are immunocompromised. The patient's age, change in mental status, and presence of a RUQ mass are all consistent with this diagnosis.

Option C (choledocholithiasis) is unlikely because the ultrasound does not show any evidence of gallstones in the common bile duct. Emphysematous cholecystitis (option D) is a rare condition characterized by gas in the gallbladder wall, which is not mentioned in the patient's ultrasound findings. Hepatic adenoma (option E) is a benign liver tumor that would not typically present with RUQ tenderness and pericholecystic fluid.

The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines recommend that patients with suspected acute cholecystitis undergo urgent ultrasound evaluation to confirm the diagnosis. In this case, the ultrasound findings support the diagnosis of acalculous cholecystitis.",Success
A 35-year-old female is brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious. The patient is found to have a blood glucose level of 35 mg/dL. Hgb A1c was found to be 5.1%. C-peptide level was found to be decreased. The patient returned to her baseline after glucose replacement. She states that she has never had an episode like this before. She has no significant past medical history but reports a family history of diabetes in her mother. She states that she has been undergoing a difficult divorce over the past few months. What is the likely cause of this patient's condition?,B,"The correct answer is B. Factitious disorder.

Here's why:

* The patient's blood glucose level of 35 mg/dL indicates severe hypoglycemia, which is a life-threatening condition.
* The Hgb A1c level of 5.1% suggests that the patient does not have diabetes, as a level below 5.7% is considered normal.
* The decreased C-peptide level suggests that the patient's pancreas is not producing enough insulin, which is unusual in a non-diabetic patient.
* The patient's rapid recovery after glucose replacement suggests that the hypoglycemia was not due to an underlying medical condition, but rather an external factor.
* The patient's history of a difficult divorce and lack of significant past medical history raise suspicions of a psychological or factitious disorder.
* Factitious disorder, also known as Munchausen syndrome, is a condition in which a person intentionally produces or feigns symptoms of illness to gain attention and sympathy. In this case, the patient may have intentionally induced hypoglycemia to seek medical attention and escape from her stressful situation.

The other options are unlikely:

* A. Insulinoma is a rare tumor that produces excessive insulin, leading to hypoglycemia. However, the patient's decreased C-peptide level and rapid recovery after glucose replacement make this diagnosis less likely.
* C. Alimentary hypoglycemia is a condition that occurs when the body produces too much insulin after eating, leading to hypoglycemia. However, this condition typically occurs in people with diabetes or those who have had gastric bypass surgery, which is not the case here.
* D. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. While hypothyroidism can cause hypoglycemia, it is not a likely cause in this patient given the normal Hgb A1c level and rapid recovery after glucose replacement.
* E. Somatization disorder is a condition in which a person experiences physical symptoms without a clear medical explanation. While the patient's symptoms may be psychologically driven, the intentional production of symptoms and the patient's history of a difficult divorce suggest factitious disorder as a more likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to the physician with complaints of increased urinary frequency and decreasing volumes for the past 2 months. He does not complain of any pain during urination. He is frustrated that he has to wake up 2 or 3 times per night to urinate even though he tried reducing the amount of water he consumes before bed and made some other dietary changes without any improvement. He has no family history of prostate disease. Physical examination is negative for any suprapubic mass or tenderness, and there is no costovertebral angle tenderness. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?",D,"The correct answer is A. Urinalysis and serum creatinine.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms of increased urinary frequency and decreased volumes, particularly at night, suggest a possible underlying urinary tract issue. The absence of pain during urination and negative physical examination findings make a urinary tract infection (UTI) or kidney stone less likely. However, it's essential to rule out any underlying kidney disease or other potential causes of the patient's symptoms.

Urinalysis is a crucial diagnostic test to evaluate for signs of infection, hematuria, or proteinuria, which could indicate kidney disease. Serum creatinine is also necessary to assess kidney function and rule out chronic kidney disease.

While a digital rectal examination (DRE) may be indicated to assess the prostate, it's not the best next step in this scenario. The patient's symptoms are more suggestive of a urinary tract issue rather than prostate-related problems, and a DRE may not provide immediate insight into the underlying cause of his symptoms.

Ultrasonography may be useful in evaluating the kidneys and urinary tract, but it's not the initial diagnostic test of choice. Reassurance alone is not sufficient, as the patient's symptoms require further evaluation to determine the underlying cause.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is not relevant in this scenario, as the patient's symptoms are not suggestive of prostate cancer, and PSA is primarily used as a screening tool for prostate cancer in asymptomatic men.

Therefore, the best next step in managing this patient is to perform urinalysis and measure serum creatinine to rule out underlying kidney disease and assess kidney function.",Success
"A 48-year-old woman with chronic tension headaches comes to the physician because of several episodes of bilateral flank pain and reddish urine within the past month. Current medications include aspirin, which she takes almost daily for headaches. Her temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F) and her blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows costovertebral tenderness to percussion bilaterally. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 10.2 g/dL and serum creatinine concentration of 2.4 mg/dL. Urine studies show:
Urine
Protein
3+
RBC > 16/hpf
WBC 2/hpf
There are no casts or dysmorphic RBCs visualized on microscopic analysis of the urine. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's hematuria?""",E,"The correct answer is D. Lipid peroxidation within tubular cells.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and physical examination findings are consistent with acute kidney injury (AKI) and hematuria. The presence of bilateral flank pain, costovertebral tenderness, and reddish urine suggests a kidney-related problem. The laboratory results show a decreased hemoglobin concentration, elevated serum creatinine, and proteinuria (3+ protein in the urine).

The most likely underlying cause of this patient's hematuria is analgesic nephropathy, which is a known complication of chronic aspirin use. Aspirin can cause lipid peroxidation within tubular cells, leading to oxidative stress and damage to the renal tubules. This can result in hematuria, proteinuria, and AKI.

The other options are not supported by the patient's presentation and laboratory results:

A. Tubular lumen obstruction by protein casts is not a direct cause of hematuria and is more related to acute tubular necrosis.

B. Necrotizing inflammation of the renal glomeruli is not consistent with the patient's presentation, as there is no evidence of glomerulonephritis (e.g., no casts or dysmorphic RBCs in the urine).

C. Bacterial infection of the renal parenchyma (pyelonephritis) is unlikely, as the patient does not have fever or pyuria (only 2 WBC/hpf in the urine).

E. Vasoconstriction of the medullary vessels is not a direct cause of hematuria and is more related to prerenal azotemia.

In summary, the patient's chronic aspirin use and laboratory results point to analgesic nephropathy as the most likely underlying cause of her hematuria, which is caused by lipid peroxidation within tubular cells.",Success
"A 37-year-old primigravid woman at 12 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and dull suprapubic pain for 3 hours. She has had spotting during the last 3 days. Her medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 89/65 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a dilated cervical os and a uterus consistent in size with an 11-week gestation. Ultrasonography shows an embryo of 4 cm in crown-rump length and no fetal cardiac activity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Dilation and curettage.

Here's why:

The patient is presenting with vaginal bleeding, dull suprapubic pain, and a dilated cervical os, which suggests a diagnosis of miscarriage. The ultrasound findings of an embryo with no fetal cardiac activity confirm this diagnosis. Given the patient's symptoms and ultrasound results, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform a dilation and curettage (D&C) to evacuate the nonviable pregnancy tissue.

Misoprostol therapy (Option A) is not indicated in this scenario, as it is typically used to induce labor or treat postpartum hemorrhage, not to manage a miscarriage.

Follow-up ultrasonography (Option B) is not necessary, as the diagnosis of miscarriage has already been confirmed.

Methotrexate therapy (Option C) is used to treat ectopic pregnancies, not miscarriages.

Complete bed rest (Option E) is not a treatment for miscarriage and may not be necessary in this scenario.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), D&C is a common and effective treatment for miscarriage, especially in cases where the patient is experiencing heavy bleeding or is at risk for hemorrhage.",Success
"A 17-year-old female accidentally eats a granola bar manufactured on equipment that processes peanuts. She develops type I hypersensitivity-mediated histamine release, resulting in pruritic wheals on the skin. Which of the following layers of this patient's skin would demonstrate histologic changes on biopsy of her lesions?",E,"The correct answer is E. Dermis.

Here's why:

In type I hypersensitivity reactions, such as an allergic response to peanuts, histamine release from mast cells leads to increased permeability of blood vessels, causing fluid leakage and edema in the dermis. This results in the characteristic pruritic wheals or hives on the skin.

On biopsy, the dermis would demonstrate histologic changes, including:

1. Edema: Increased fluid in the dermal tissue, leading to swelling.
2. Inflammatory infiltrate: Presence of immune cells, such as eosinophils and lymphocytes, which are attracted to the site of the allergic reaction.
3. Dermal mast cell degranulation: Evidence of mast cell activation, with release of histamine and other mediators.

The other options are incorrect because:

A. Stratum corneum: This is the outermost layer of the epidermis, which would not show significant changes in a type I hypersensitivity reaction.

B. Stratum granulosum: This layer of the epidermis is involved in keratinocyte differentiation and would not be directly affected by the allergic reaction.

C. Stratum spinosum: This layer of the epidermis is also not directly involved in the allergic response.

D. Stratum basale: This is the innermost layer of the epidermis, which would not demonstrate significant changes in a type I hypersensitivity reaction.

The dermis is the layer of skin that would show histologic changes consistent with an allergic reaction, making option E the correct answer.",Success
"A 4-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with a persistent cough, fever, and vomiting. The past year the child has been admitted to the hospital 3 times with pneumonia. For the past 1 week, the child has been experiencing thick purulent cough and says that her chest feels ‘heavy’. Her stools have been loose and foul-smelling over the past week. Her parents are also concerned that she has not gained much weight due to her frequent hospital visits. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. On physical exam, the temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F). She appears lethargic and uncomfortable. Crackles are heard in the lower lung bases, with dullness to percussion. A small nasal polyp is also present on inspection. Which of the following is the most likely cause for the girl’s symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Dysfunction in a transmembrane regulator.

The patient's symptoms, including recurrent pneumonia, thick purulent cough, and foul-smelling stools, are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). The presence of a nasal polyp also supports this diagnosis. Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder caused by a dysfunction in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which regulates salt and water transport in the body. This leads to thick, sticky mucus accumulation in the lungs, digestive tract, and other organs, causing recurring respiratory infections, malabsorption, and malnutrition.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms:

B. Inefficient breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine is related to maple syrup urine disease, a rare genetic disorder that affects amino acid metabolism. While it can cause vomiting and lethargy, it does not typically present with respiratory symptoms or malabsorption.

C. Dysfunction in the motility of respiratory cilia is related to primary ciliary dyskinesia, a rare genetic disorder that affects the movement of cilia in the respiratory tract. While it can cause recurrent respiratory infections, it does not typically present with malabsorption or gastrointestinal symptoms.

D. Acute hypersensitivity changes and bronchospasm are related to asthma, which can cause coughing and wheezing, but it does not typically present with recurrent pneumonia, malabsorption, or foul-smelling stools.

E. Deficiency in lymphocytic activity is related to immunodeficiency disorders, which can cause recurrent infections, but it does not typically present with malabsorption or gastrointestinal symptoms.

"A 48-year-old man seeks evaluation at a clinic with a complaint of breathlessness for the past couple of weeks. He says that he finds it difficult to walk a few blocks and has to rest. He also complains of a cough for the past 3 months, which is dry and hacking in nature. The medical history is relevant for an idiopathic arrhythmia for which he takes amiodarone daily. He is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. He denies any use of illicit drugs. The vital signs are as follows: heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.6°C (99.68°F), and blood pressure 132/70 mm Hg. The physical examination is significant for inspiratory crackles over the lung bases. An echocardiogram shows a normal ejection fraction. A chest radiograph is performed and shown below. Which of the following findings will most likely be noted on spirometry?",D,"The correct answer is D. Decreased FEV1 and FVC with normal FEV1/FVC ratio.

The patient's symptoms, physical examination, and chest radiograph suggest a diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD), which is a known side effect of amiodarone therapy. The inspiratory crackles over the lung bases on physical examination and the radiographic findings of bilateral interstitial infiltrates support this diagnosis.

Spirometry is a lung function test that measures forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). In ILD, the lung parenchyma is affected, leading to a restrictive pattern on spirometry. This means that both FEV1 and FVC will be decreased, but the FEV1/FVC ratio will be normal or even increased due to the proportional decrease in both values.

Option A is incorrect because a decreased FEV1 with a normal FVC is not consistent with a restrictive pattern. Option B is incorrect because a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio is more consistent with an obstructive pattern, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Option C is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings suggest lung disease, which would not result in normal spirometry values. Option E is incorrect because an increase in FEV1 and FVC is not consistent with any lung disease.

It's important to note that the diagnosis of ILD should be confirmed with further testing, such as high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and/or lung biopsy, as spirometry alone cannot establish a definitive diagnosis.",Success
"A 2,300 g (5 lb) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this infant?",A,"The correct answer is A. Administer zidovudine.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), infants born to HIV-infected mothers should receive antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV. The recommended regimen includes zidovudine (ZDV) for 6 weeks, regardless of the mother's viral load or mode of delivery.

In this scenario, the mother received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, which is appropriate. However, the infant still requires prophylaxis to reduce the risk of transmission. The mother's viral load of 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery indicates that there is still a risk of transmission, although it is lower than if her viral load were higher.

HIV antibody testing (Option B) is not appropriate at this time, as it may detect maternal antibodies rather than the infant's own antibodies. HIV DNA testing (Option C) or HIV RNA testing (Option D) may be used to diagnose HIV infection in the infant, but they are not the next step in management. Reassurance and follow-up (Option E) are not sufficient, as the infant requires prophylaxis to prevent transmission.

The CDC and AAP recommend that zidovudine be initiated as soon as possible after birth, ideally within 6-12 hours of delivery, and continued for 6 weeks. This regimen has been shown to reduce the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV.",Success
"A 60-year-old woman presents to a physician for worsening shortness of breath and increasing abdominal distention over the last 3 months. She says that the shortness of breath is worse on exertion and improves with rest. While she could previously walk to the nearby store for her groceries, she now has to drive because she gets ''winded'' on the way. The patient was diagnosed with diabetes 5 years ago and is compliant with her medications. The medical history is otherwise unremarkable. The physical examination reveals gross ascites and visibly engorged periumbilical veins. Bilateral pitting edema is noted around the ankles. The finger-prick blood glucose level is 100 mg/dL. What is the mechanism of action of the anti-diabetic medication this patient is most likely taking?",D,"Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, I would choose option D: Increased gene expression of GLUT-4.

Here's my reasoning:

The patient's symptoms, such as worsening shortness of breath and increasing abdominal distension, suggest right-sided heart failure, which is likely caused by a underlying condition such as heart failure or constrictive pericarditis. The presence of gross ascites, engorged periumbilical veins, and bilateral pitting edema around the ankles further support this diagnosis.

Given the patient's history of diabetes, it is likely that she is taking an oral anti-diabetic medication. The mechanism of action of the medication can be inferred from the options provided.

Option D, increased gene expression of GLUT-4, is consistent with the mechanism of action of thiazolidinediones (TZDs), a class of oral anti-diabetic medications. TZDs, such as pioglitazone, work by increasing the expression of GLUT-4, a glucose transporter, in adipose tissue and muscle, thereby improving insulin sensitivity.

The other options do not match the patient's symptoms or medical history:

A. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase is the mechanism of action of metformin, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

B. Binding to the alpha subunit of the insulin receptor is not a known mechanism of action of any oral anti-diabetic medication.

C. Closure of ATP-sensitive K-channels in the pancreatic beta-cell is the mechanism of action of sulfonylureas, which would increase insulin secretion, but this is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

E. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are injectable medications that work by increasing insulin secretion and suppressing glucagon secretion, but this is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or medical history.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, I believe the patient is most likely taking a thiazolidinedione, which increases gene expression of GLUT-4, making option D the correct answer.",Success
"A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician because of episodic pelvic pain radiating to her back and thighs for 4 months. The pain occurs a few hours before her menstrual period and lasts for 2 days. She has been taking ibuprofen, which has provided some relief. Menses have occurred at regular 28-day intervals since menarche at the age of 12 years and last for 5 to 6 days. She is sexually active with two male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandin.

The patient's symptoms, such as pelvic pain radiating to her back and thighs, occurring a few hours before her menstrual period and lasting for 2 days, are consistent with dysmenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea is a common gynecological complaint characterized by painful menstrual cramps, often accompanied by other symptoms like backache, thigh pain, and nausea.

The most likely cause of dysmenorrhea is endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandin. During menstruation, the uterus contracts to expel the shed endometrial lining, leading to pain. Prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances, play a key role in this process by stimulating uterine contractions. The patient's response to ibuprofen, a prostaglandin inhibitor, supports this diagnosis.

The other options are not as likely:

B. Ascending infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, or surrounding tissue (pelvic inflammatory disease, PID) is possible given the patient's inconsistent condom use, but the symptoms are not consistent with PID, which typically presents with more severe and prolonged pelvic pain, fever, and abnormal vaginal discharge.

C. Fluid-filled sac within the ovary (ovarian cyst) may cause pelvic pain, but it is unlikely to cause cyclic pain related to menstruation.

D. Pregnancy is unlikely given the patient's regular menstrual cycles and lack of other symptoms suggestive of pregnancy.

E. Hormone-sensitive smooth muscle tumor of the myometrium (uterine leiomyoma) may cause pelvic pain, but it is typically not related to menstruation and would not respond to ibuprofen.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and response to ibuprofen, the most likely cause of her symptoms is dysmenorrhea due to endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandin.",Success
"A 25-year-old male is hospitalized for acute agitation, photophobia, and dysphagia. His parents report that he has been experiencing flu-like symptoms for one week prior to hospital admission. Five weeks ago, the patient was in Mexico, where he went on several spelunking expeditions with friends. The patient ultimately becomes comatose and dies. Autopsy of brain tissue suggests a viral infection. The likely causal virus spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) in the following manner:",C,"The correct answer is C. Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons.

The patient's symptoms, such as acute agitation, photophobia, and dysphagia, are consistent with a viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS). The history of spelunking expeditions in Mexico suggests exposure to the rabies virus, which is commonly found in bats.

Rabies virus is a neurotropic virus that spreads to the CNS through retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons. The virus enters the body through a bite wound or other skin lesions, and then travels up the nerve fibers to the CNS, where it causes inflammation and damage.

Option A, hematogenous dissemination to the meninges, is not the primary route of entry for rabies virus. Option B, entrance via cribiform plate, is not a known route of entry for rabies virus. Option D, reactivation of virus previously latent in dorsal root ganglia, is not applicable to rabies virus, which is not a latent virus. Option E, infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, is not the primary mechanism of rabies virus entry into the CNS.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) both confirm that rabies virus spreads to the CNS through retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons.",Success
A 19-year-old Caucasian male presents to your office with hypopigmented skin. He undergoes a skin biopsy and is found to have an absence of melanocytes in the epidermis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,C,"The correct answer is C. Vitiligo.

Here's why:

Vitiligo is a chronic autoimmune skin condition characterized by the destruction of melanocytes, resulting in the loss of skin pigmentation. The absence of melanocytes in the epidermis, as found in the skin biopsy, is a hallmark feature of vitiligo. This condition typically presents with hypopigmented or depigmented patches on the skin, which can appear anywhere on the body.

In contrast:

A. Tinea versicolor is a fungal infection that causes skin discoloration, but it does not involve the absence of melanocytes. Instead, it leads to an overgrowth of Malassezia furfur, a yeast that normally inhabits the skin, resulting in hypopigmented or hyperpigmented patches.

B. Albinism is a congenital condition characterized by a complete or partial absence of melanin production. While albinism can cause hypopigmentation, it is a genetic disorder that affects melanin production throughout the body, not just in the epidermis.

D. Solar lentigo, also known as age spots or liver spots, is a benign skin lesion caused by prolonged sun exposure. It is characterized by an increase in melanin production, resulting in hyperpigmented spots, not hypopigmentation.

E. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that arises from melanocytes. While melanoma can cause skin discoloration, it is not characterized by the absence of melanocytes in the epidermis.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American Academy of Dermatology, support the diagnosis of vitiligo based on the presence of hypopigmented skin and the absence of melanocytes in the epidermis.",Success

A peripheral blood smear and differential shows 92% small normocytic lymphocytes. The patient’s diagnosis in confirmed by bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry. He is monitored through regular follow-up visits. Three years after the initial diagnosis, the patient presents with swollen cervical and axillary lymph nodes, unintentional weight loss of 4.5 kg (approx. 10 lb), and “rib pain” on his right side. On physical examination, there is palpable, firm, non-tender cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy bilaterally. He also has moderate splenomegaly, which, when palpated, elicits pain. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient’s most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Fludarabine.

Based on the patient's initial presentation with a high WBC count, normocytic lymphocytosis, and a bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry confirming the diagnosis, it is likely that the patient has Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). The patient's initial management with regular follow-up visits is consistent with the ""watch and wait"" approach often employed in asymptomatic CLL patients.

However, with the development of symptoms such as swollen lymph nodes, unintentional weight loss, and ""rib pain"" (suggesting lymphadenopathy and possible bone marrow involvement), the patient has progressed to a more advanced stage of CLL. The presence of palpable, firm, non-tender cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy and moderate splenomegaly with pain further supports this diagnosis.

Fludarabine is a purine analog that is commonly used as a first-line treatment for CLL, particularly in patients with symptomatic disease. It has been shown to improve overall response rates, complete response rates, and progression-free survival in CLL patients.

The other options are not directly related to the treatment of CLL:

A. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic used in various cancer regimens, but it is not a primary treatment for CLL.

B. Bleomycin is a chemotherapy agent used to treat lymphomas, testicular cancer, and other malignancies, but it is not typically used in CLL.

C. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), but it is not effective in CLL.

E. Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid used to treat various types of cancer, including lymphomas and leukemias, but it is not a primary treatment for CLL.

Therefore, the best treatment for this patient's most likely diagnosis of CLL is fludarabine.",Success

Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows a pH of 7.28 and a HCO3- concentration of 14 mEq/L. Prolonged treatment with which of the following drugs would best explain this patient's findings?""",D,"The correct answer is A. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Here's a breakdown of the patient's laboratory results and how they relate to the correct answer:

* Serum sodium (Na+) is slightly low, which could indicate volume depletion or a mild degree of hyponatremia.
* Serum potassium (K+) is low, indicating hypokalemia.
* Serum magnesium (Mg2+) is within normal limits.
* Urine pH is 7.0, which is alkaline. This is unusual, as the body typically excretes excess hydrogen ions in the urine to compensate for metabolic acidosis.
* Arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.28, indicating metabolic acidosis. The bicarbonate (HCO3-) concentration is low, which is consistent with metabolic acidosis.

Considering the patient's laboratory results, the most likely explanation is that she has developed a type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis (RTA) due to prolonged treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. This antibiotic combination is known to cause type 1 RTA by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in the distal nephron, leading to impaired hydrogen ion secretion and bicarbonate reabsorption.

The other options do not fit the patient's laboratory results as well:

* Acetazolamide (B) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that can cause metabolic acidosis, but it would not typically cause hypokalemia or alkaline urine.
* Eplerenone (C) is a potassium-sparing diuretic that would not cause metabolic acidosis or alkaline urine.
* Amphotericin B (D) can cause hypokalemia, but it would not typically cause metabolic acidosis or alkaline urine.
* Heparin (E) is an anticoagulant that would not cause metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, or alkaline urine.

Therefore, based on the patient's laboratory results, the most likely explanation is that she has developed type 1 RTA due to prolonged treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.",Success
"A 21-year-old male presents to his primary care provider for fatigue. He reports that he graduated from college last month and returned 3 days ago from a 2 week vacation to Vietnam and Cambodia. For the past 2 days, he has developed a worsening headache, malaise, and pain in his hands and wrists. The patient has a past medical history of asthma managed with albuterol as needed. He is sexually active with both men and women, and he uses condoms “most of the time.” On physical exam, the patient’s temperature is 102.5°F (39.2°C), blood pressure is 112/66 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

Bilirubin (total): 0.8 mg/dL
Bilirubin (conjugated): 0.3 mg/dL

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is B. Dengue fever.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as headache, malaise, and joint pain, are consistent with a viral infection. The physical exam findings, including a maculopapular rash and tenderness to palpation over the metacarpophalangeal joints, also support this diagnosis.

The laboratory results are also consistent with dengue fever:

* Leukopenia (low white blood cell count) is a common finding in dengue fever.
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is also a hallmark of dengue fever.
* The patient's liver enzymes (AST and ALT) are mildly elevated, which is consistent with dengue fever.
* The patient's electrolyte levels and renal function are within normal limits, which makes other diagnoses less likely.

The patient's travel history to Vietnam and Cambodia, where dengue fever is endemic, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Chikungunya (Option A) is also a possibility, given the patient's travel history and symptoms. However, the laboratory results, particularly the thrombocytopenia, are more consistent with dengue fever.

Epstein-Barr virus (Option C) is unlikely, given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. While Epstein-Barr virus can cause fatigue, headache, and joint pain, it is not typically associated with thrombocytopenia or a maculopapular rash.

Hepatitis A (Option D) is also unlikely, given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. While hepatitis A can cause fatigue, headache, and joint pain, it is typically associated with elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels, which are not seen in this patient.

Typhoid fever (Option E) is unlikely, given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. While typhoid fever can cause fever, headache, and joint pain, it is typically associated with abdominal symptoms, such as diarrhea or abdominal pain, which are not seen in this patient.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and laboratory results, dengue fever is the most likely diagnosis.",Success

She does not use illicit drugs. Current medications include norepinephrine, ceftriaxone, and acetaminophen. She appears well. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate is 96/min, and blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. Examination of the back shows costovertebral tenderness bilaterally.

T4, free   0.9 ng/dL
Repeat blood cultures are negative. A chest X-ray shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",E,"The correct answer is B. Levothyroxine.

The patient's laboratory results show a low free T3 (triiodothyronine) level of 0.1 ng/dL, which is indicative of hypothyroidism. The normal range for free T3 is typically between 2.3 and 4.2 ng/dL. Although the free T4 (thyroxine) level is within the normal range, the low free T3 level suggests that the patient has a conversion problem from T4 to T3, which is a common phenomenon in critically ill patients.

This condition is known as non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) or euthyroid sick syndrome. It is a common phenomenon in critically ill patients, especially those with sepsis, and is thought to be an adaptive response to illness. However, it can contribute to hypotension and other symptoms.

Levothyroxine (T4) replacement is often used to treat NTIS, as it can help improve cardiovascular function and reduce mortality in critically ill patients. Therefore, option B, Levothyroxine, is the most appropriate treatment.

Option A, Bromocriptine, is a dopamine agonist that is used to treat hyperprolactinemia and other conditions, but it is not relevant to this patient's condition.

Option C, Removing toxic drugs, is not applicable, as the patient is not taking any medications that are known to cause thyroid dysfunction.

Option D, Thiamine therapy, may be useful in patients with sepsis, but it is not specifically indicated for NTIS.

Option E, Treating the underlying illness, is important, but it is not a direct treatment for the patient's hypothyroidism.

"An 11-year-old child complains of pain in the leg while playing. Blood pressure in the upper limb is 140/90 mm Hg and lower limbs are 110/70 mm Hg. There is a brachiofemoral delay in the pulse. Auscultation shows a loud S1, loud S2, and S4. There is a presence of an ejection systolic murmur in the interscapular area. Chest X-ray reveals the notching of the ribs. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Coarctation of the aorta.

Here's why:

* The patient presents with leg pain during physical activity, which suggests decreased blood flow to the lower extremities.
* The blood pressure difference between the upper and lower limbs (140/90 mm Hg in the upper limb vs. 110/70 mm Hg in the lower limb) is a hallmark of coarctation of the aorta. This is because the coarctation creates a pressure gradient, resulting in higher blood pressure in the upper body and lower blood pressure in the lower body.
* The brachiofemoral delay in the pulse is another key finding, as it indicates that the pulse is delayed in the femoral artery compared to the brachial artery. This is consistent with coarctation of the aorta, which obstructs blood flow to the lower extremities.
* The auscultation findings, including a loud S1, loud S2, and S4, are consistent with aortic stenosis or coarctation of the aorta. However, the presence of an ejection systolic murmur in the interscapular area is more suggestive of coarctation of the aorta.
* The chest X-ray finding of notching of the ribs is a classic radiographic sign of coarctation of the aorta. This notching is caused by the erosion of the ribs by the dilated intercostal arteries, which develop as collateral circulation to bypass the coarctation.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

* A. Pulmonic stenosis: This would not explain the blood pressure difference between the upper and lower limbs or the brachiofemoral delay in the pulse.
* B. Patent ductus arteriosus: This would not cause a pressure gradient between the upper and lower body, and the murmur would be continuous, not ejection systolic.
* D. Aortic stenosis: While this could explain some of the auscultation findings, it would not account for the blood pressure difference between the upper and lower limbs or the brachiofemoral delay in the pulse.
* E. Transposition of great vessels: This would not cause a pressure gradient between the upper and lower body, and the murmur would not be ejection systolic in the interscapular area.

Therefore, based on the combination of clinical findings, the most likely diagnosis is coarctation of the aorta.",Success
"A 59-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of excruciating left knee pain for 4 days. He underwent a total knee arthroplasty of his left knee joint 4 months ago. He has hypertension and osteoarthritis. Current medications include glucosamine, amlodipine, and meloxicam. His temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 118/71 mm Hg. Examination shows a tender, swollen left knee joint; range of motion is limited by pain. Analysis of the synovial fluid confirms septic arthritis, and the prosthesis is removed. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",A,"The correct answer is A. Staphylococcus epidermidis.

Justification:

Septic arthritis after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a serious complication, and the most likely causal organism in this scenario is Staphylococcus epidermidis. This is because S. epidermidis is a common skin commensal that can colonize the skin and mucous membranes, making it a frequent cause of prosthetic joint infections (PJIs).

S. epidermidis is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus that is often resistant to multiple antibiotics, making it a challenging pathogen to treat. It is estimated that S. epidermidis accounts for up to 30-40% of PJIs, particularly in the early post-operative period (within 3-6 months) after TKA.

While the other options are possible causes of septic arthritis, they are less likely in this scenario:

* Staphylococcus aureus (Option C) is also a common cause of PJIs, but it is more likely to cause acute infections, whereas S. epidermidis is more commonly associated with chronic, low-grade infections.
* Escherichia coli (Option B) is a gram-negative bacterium that can cause septic arthritis, but it is more commonly associated with urinary tract infections or intra-abdominal infections.
* Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Option D) is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause septic arthritis, but it is less common in PJIs and more commonly associated with hospital-acquired infections.
* Group B Streptococcus (Option E) is a common cause of septic arthritis in neonates and young children, but it is less likely in an adult patient with a prosthetic joint infection.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), recommend that S. epidermidis be considered a likely pathogen in the diagnosis and treatment of PJIs.",Success

On examination, he is ill-appearing, and he has a tender liver edge that is palpable approx. 2 cm below the right costal margin. Percussion and movement worsens the pain. Abdominal ultrasonography is shown. Stool is negative for Entamoeba histolytica antigen. Which of the following is the best initial step in management of this patient condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Antibiotics and drainage.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including fever, right shoulder pain, and a tender liver edge, are consistent with a diagnosis of liver abscess. The abdominal ultrasonography likely shows a liver abscess, which is a collection of pus in the liver.

Given the patient's history of diabetes mellitus and the presence of a liver abscess, the most likely cause is a bacterial infection, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae or Escherichia coli. The initial step in management should be to administer antibiotics that cover these organisms, such as a third-generation cephalosporin or a fluoroquinolone, in combination with drainage of the abscess.

Option A, metronidazole and paromomycin, is not the best initial step because these medications are typically used to treat amebic liver abscess, which is less likely given the negative stool test for Entamoeba histolytica antigen.

Option B, antifungal therapy, is not indicated because there is no evidence to suggest a fungal infection.

Option C, cholecystectomy, is not necessary at this time because the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a liver abscess than with gallbladder disease.

Option E, ERCP, is not the best initial step because it is an invasive procedure that may not be necessary for the management of a liver abscess.

According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines, the management of liver abscesses typically involves antibiotics and drainage of the abscess.",Success

Biopsy of the skin is likely to reveal bacteria that are:",B,"The correct answer is B. Acid-fast.

The image A provided likely shows a patient with lepromatous leprosy, a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The skin lesions, thickening, and loss of sensation in the extremities are all consistent with this diagnosis.

Mycobacterium leprae is an acid-fast bacterium, which means that it retains the carbol fuchsin stain even when decolorized with acid. This is a distinctive feature of mycobacteria and is used to identify them in laboratory tests.

The other options are not correct:

A. Cocci refers to a shape of bacteria, which is not specific to M. leprae.

Physical examination shows nontender, right axillary, cervical, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. His serum calcium concentration is 15.1 mg/dL and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration is 9 pg/mL. A lymph node biopsy shows granuloma formation and large CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's laboratory findings?",D,"The correct answer is E. Production of PTH-related peptide by malignant cells.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy, suggest an underlying malignancy. The biopsy results showing granuloma formation and large CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei are consistent with Hodgkin lymphoma.

The laboratory findings of elevated serum calcium (15.1 mg/dL) and normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration (9 pg/mL) are unusual. Normally, high calcium levels would suppress PTH production through negative feedback. However, in this case, the PTH level is not suppressed, suggesting that the elevated calcium is not due to primary hyperparathyroidism.

The most likely explanation is that the malignant cells in the lymphoma are producing parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), which is a protein that can mimic the effects of PTH and cause hypercalcemia. This is a common paraneoplastic syndrome associated with certain types of cancer, including Hodgkin lymphoma.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings:

A. Excessive intake of dietary ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) could cause hypercalcemia, but it would not explain the normal PTH level.

B. Increased release of PTH by parathyroid chief cells would be expected to cause hypercalcemia, but the PTH level would be elevated, not normal.

C. Induction of focal osteolysis by tumor cells could contribute to hypercalcemia, but it would not explain the normal PTH level.

D. Secretion of γ-interferon by activated T-lymphocytes is not directly related to the patient's laboratory findings.

Therefore, the correct answer is E. Production of PTH-related peptide by malignant cells.",Success

Anti-HBe Negative
Anti-HCV Negative
Which of the following best explains this patient's laboratory findings?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Active hepatitis A infection.

Here's a breakdown of the laboratory findings:

* Anti-HAV IgM Positive: This indicates the presence of IgM antibodies against the hepatitis A virus (HAV), which are typically produced early in the course of an acute infection. A positive IgM result suggests that the patient is currently infected with HAV.
* Anti-HAV IgG Negative: The absence of IgG antibodies against HAV suggests that the patient has not had a previous HAV infection or has not developed long-term immunity to HAV.
* HBsAg Negative, Anti-HBs Positive, HBcAg Negative, Anti-HBc Negative, HBeAg Negative, Anti-HBe Negative: These results indicate that the patient is not infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and has not had a previous HBV infection.
* Anti-HCV Negative: This result indicates that the patient is not infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV).

Given the presence of IgM antibodies against HAV and the absence of IgG antibodies, the most likely explanation is that the patient has an active hepatitis A infection. This is consistent with the patient's recent travel to Guatemala, where hepatitis A is endemic.

The other options are not supported by the laboratory findings:

* A. Active hepatitis B infection: The patient's HBsAg and HBcAg results are negative, indicating that they are not infected with HBV.

"A 7-month-old male infant is brought to the pediatrician by his mother. She reports that the child develops severe sunburns every time the infant is exposed to sunlight. She has applied copious amounts of sunscreen to the infant but this has not helped the problem. On examination, there are multiple areas of reddened skin primarily in sun exposed areas. The child’s corneas appear irritated and erythematous. Which of the following processes is likely impaired in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Nucleotide excision repair.

The symptoms described in the question, such as severe sunburns, reddened skin, and irritated corneas, are consistent with a diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). XP is a rare genetic disorder characterized by extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, leading to skin and eye damage.

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a DNA repair pathway that plays a crucial role in protecting against UV-induced DNA damage. In individuals with XP, the NER pathway is impaired, leading to an inability to repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation. This results in the accumulation of mutations, which can lead to skin cancer, premature aging, and other complications.

The other options are not directly related to the symptoms described in the question:

B. Non-homologous end joining is a DNA repair pathway involved in repairing double-strand breaks, but it is not specifically related to UV-induced DNA damage.

C. Homologous recombination is a DNA repair pathway involved in repairing double-strand breaks, but it is not primarily involved in repairing UV-induced DNA damage.

D. Mismatch repair is a DNA repair pathway involved in correcting mismatched bases during DNA replication, but it is not directly related to UV-induced DNA damage.

E. Base excision repair is a DNA repair pathway involved in repairing oxidative DNA damage, but it is not primarily involved in repairing UV-induced DNA damage.

In summary, the symptoms described in the question are consistent with a diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum, which is caused by an impairment in the nucleotide excision repair pathway.",Success

A biopsy of this patient's lesion would most likely demonstrate which of the following findings?",B,"The correct answer is E. Stromal amyloid deposition.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a thyroid lesion, and the family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in his maternal uncle increases the suspicion for this diagnosis. MTC is a type of thyroid cancer that arises from the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland and is often associated with amyloid deposition.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's presentation:

A. Diffuse infiltrate of lymphoid cells destroying thyroid follicles is more consistent with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune thyroid disorder.

B. Dense fibroinflammatory infiltrate is more consistent with Riedel's thyroiditis, a rare inflammatory disorder of the thyroid gland.

C. Papillary projections with dystrophically calcified regions are characteristic of papillary thyroid carcinoma, a different type of thyroid cancer.

D. Pleomorphic undifferentiated infiltrative cells with necrosis are more consistent with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, a highly aggressive and undifferentiated type of thyroid cancer.

The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue and weight gain, may be related to the underlying thyroid lesion, but they are not specific to MTC. The presence of a firm, symmetric, and stone-hard thyroid gland on physical examination is more consistent with MTC, and a biopsy would likely demonstrate stromal amyloid deposition, which is a hallmark feature of this disease.",Success
"A group of researchers decided to explore whether the estimates of incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were influenced by the number of years it took to examine administrative data. These estimates were not only based on hospital discharges, but also on physician billing codes. For study purposes, the researchers labeled incident cases at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases were those that were coded as harboring SLE at any time, with patients maintaining their diagnosis until death. Which statement is true regarding the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study?",B,"The correct answer is C. The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.

Here's why:

Incidence rate refers to the number of new cases of a disease (in this case, SLE) occurring within a specific time period. Prevalence rate, on the other hand, refers to the total number of existing cases of a disease within a specific time period.

When examining administrative data, the researchers labeled incident cases as the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases were those coded as having SLE at any time, with patients maintaining their diagnosis until death. This means that prevalent cases include both new and existing cases.

If the researchers examine shorter time periods, they will capture a higher proportion of prevalent cases, including those that may have been diagnosed before the study period. This will result in an overestimation of the prevalence rate, as they will be counting cases that are not necessarily new incidents.

In contrast, examining longer time periods will provide a more accurate estimate of prevalence, as it will capture a larger proportion of incident cases that become prevalent cases over time.

The other options are incorrect:

A. Examining successively longer time periods will result in higher prevalence estimates, not lower estimates.

B. Incidence rates may be higher or lower during shorter or longer time periods, depending on the underlying disease dynamics and data quality.

D. Attack rates refer to the proportion of a population that contracts a disease during a specific time period. Including attack rates would not necessarily increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.

Neurologic exam shows 4/5 strength in the deltoid muscles bilaterally. Diffuse dry crackles are heard on lung auscultation. A faint erythematous rash is noted on the malar cheeks, periorbital areas, lateral proximal thighs, and the elbows. Which of the following tests is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is D. Serum ANA titer.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of dermatomyositis, a type of inflammatory myopathy. The key features that support this diagnosis include:

* Progressive weakness, particularly in the proximal muscles (deltoids)
* Shortness of breath and cough, suggesting interstitial lung disease
* Characteristic skin rash, known as a heliotrope rash, on the malar cheeks, periorbital areas, lateral proximal thighs, and elbows
* Dry crackles on lung auscultation, indicating interstitial lung disease

To confirm the diagnosis, a serum ANA (antinuclear antibody) titer is the most likely test. ANA is a common autoantibody found in various autoimmune diseases, including dermatomyositis. A positive ANA titer, particularly with a high titer, supports the diagnosis of dermatomyositis.

While muscle biopsy (Option A) may be useful in confirming the diagnosis, it is an invasive procedure and not the first-line test. CT scan (Option B) may be useful in evaluating interstitial lung disease, but it is not specific to dermatomyositis. Pulmonary function tests (Option C) may be useful in assessing lung function, but they are not diagnostic for dermatomyositis. Skin biopsy (Option E) may show characteristic skin changes, but it is not as sensitive or specific as a serum ANA titer.

Auscultation of his chest reveals the presence of localized rhonchi over the interscapular region. A plain radiograph of the chest shows a coin-like opacity in the right lung. Further diagnostic evaluation confirms the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the lung. If his blood were to be sent for laboratory evaluation, which of the following proteins is most likely to be elevated in his serum?",E,"The correct answer is E. Neuron-specific enolase.

Small cell carcinoma of the lung (SCLC) is a type of lung cancer that is often associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, which are conditions caused by the production of hormones or other substances by the tumor. One of the characteristic features of SCLC is the production of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a glycolytic enzyme that is normally found in neurons and neuroendocrine cells.

Elevated levels of NSE in the serum are a common finding in patients with SCLC, particularly those with extensive disease. NSE is a useful tumor marker for SCLC, and its levels can be used to monitor response to treatment and detect recurrence.

The other options are not directly related to small cell carcinoma of the lung:

A. Bence-Jones protein is a light chain protein found in the urine of patients with multiple myeloma, a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow.

B. Calcitonin is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland that helps regulate calcium levels in the blood. While it can be elevated in certain types of cancer, such as medullary thyroid carcinoma, it is not typically associated with small cell carcinoma of the lung.

C. CA 15-3 is a tumor marker that is often elevated in breast cancer, but it is not specific to small cell carcinoma of the lung.

D. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme that is often elevated in various types of cancer, including lung cancer. However, it is not a specific marker for small cell carcinoma of the lung, and its elevation can be seen in many other conditions.

Therefore, based on the patient's diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the lung, the most likely protein to be elevated in his serum is neuron-specific enolase (NSE).",Success
"A 41-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with abdominal pain. He says that the pain “comes and goes” throughout the day and usually lasts 20-30 minutes per episode. He can point to the spot 1-2 inches above the umbilicus where he feels the pain. He denies any feeling of regurgitation or nighttime cough but endorses nausea. He reports that he used to eat three large meals per day but has found that eating more frequently improves his pain. He tried a couple pills of ibuprofen with food over the past couple days and thinks it helped. He has gained four pounds since his past appointment three months ago. The patient denies any diarrhea or change in his stools. He has no past medical history. He drinks 5-6 beers on the weekend and has a 20 pack-year smoking history. He denies any family history of cancer. On physical exam, he is tender to palpation above the umbilicus. Bowel sounds are present. A stool guaiac test is positive. The patient undergoes endoscopy with biopsy to diagnose his condition.

Which of the following is most likely to be found on histology?",B,"The correct answer is A. Mucosal defect in the stomach.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The abdominal pain, nausea, and tenderness to palpation above the umbilicus suggest a gastric or duodenal ulcer. The positive stool guaiac test indicates the presence of occult blood in the stool, which is common in PUD. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption are also risk factors for PUD.

The endoscopy with biopsy is likely to show a mucosal defect in the stomach, which is a characteristic feature of peptic ulcers. The biopsy may also show evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection, which is a common cause of PUD.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings:

* B. Urease-producing organism in the small intestine: This would be more consistent with a diagnosis of H. pylori infection in the duodenum, but the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest a gastric ulcer rather than a duodenal ulcer.
* C. PAS-positive material in the small intestine: This would be more consistent with a diagnosis of Whipple's disease, which is a rare bacterial infection that causes malabsorption. The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings do not suggest malabsorption.
* D. Noncaseating granulomas in the small intestine: This would be more consistent with a diagnosis of Crohn's disease, which is a type of inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings do not suggest inflammatory bowel disease.
* E. Crypt abscesses in the large intestine: This would be more consistent with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis, which is a type of inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings do not suggest inflammatory bowel disease.

Therefore, the most likely finding on histology is a mucosal defect in the stomach, consistent with a peptic ulcer.",Success
"A 5-year-old female presents to the pediatrician for a routine office visit. The patient is in kindergarten and doing well in school. She is learning to read and is able to write her first name. Her teacher has no concerns. The patient’s mother is concerned that the patient is a picky eater and often returns home from school with most of her packed lunch uneaten. The patient’s past medical history is significant for moderate persistent asthma, which has required three separate week-long courses of prednisone over the last year and recently diagnosed myopia. The patient’s mother is 5’7”, and the patient’s father is 5’10”. The patient’s weight and height are in the 55th and 5th percentile, respectively, which is consistent with her growth curve. On physical exam, the patient has a low hairline and a broad chest. Her lungs are clear with a mild expiratory wheeze. The patient’s abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. She has Tanner stage I breast development and pubic hair.

This patient is most likely to have which of the following additional findings?",A,"The correct answer is C. Elevated serum TSH level.

The patient's physical examination findings, such as a low hairline and a broad chest, are suggestive of Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females and is characterized by short stature, ovarian dysgenesis, and a range of physical features. One of the common endocrine abnormalities associated with Turner syndrome is hypothyroidism, which can lead to an elevated serum TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's presentation and physical examination findings:

A. Absent Barr bodies on buccal smear would be consistent with a male karyotype, which is not likely given the patient's female phenotype.

B. Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level could be related to various conditions, such as bone disorders or liver disease, but it is not a typical finding in Turner syndrome.

D. Low serum ACTH level is not a characteristic feature of Turner syndrome.

E. Mass in the sella turcica could be related to a pituitary tumor, but it is not a common finding in Turner syndrome.

It is essential to note that a definitive diagnosis of Turner syndrome requires a karyotype analysis, which would show a 45,X or mosaic karyotype. However, based on the patient's physical examination findings and growth curve, Turner syndrome is a likely diagnosis, and an elevated serum TSH level would be a common associated finding.",Success
" A 61-year-old man was started on rosuvastatin 40 mg 8 weeks ago and presents today for a follow-up. He complains of pain in his legs and general weakness. On physical exam, he has full range of motion of his extremities but complains of pain. His blood pressure is 126/84 mm Hg and heart rate is 74/min. The decision is made to stop the statin and return to the clinic in 2 weeks to assess any changes in symptoms. After stopping the statin, his muscular symptoms resolve. What is the next best course of action to take regarding his LDL control?",A,"The correct answer is C. Initiate a different statin.

Here's why:

The patient developed muscular symptoms (myalgias) after starting rosuvastatin, which is a common side effect of statins. After stopping the medication, the symptoms resolved, suggesting that the statin was the likely cause. Since the patient still requires LDL control, a different statin can be tried to minimize the risk of similar side effects.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend that if a patient experiences muscle symptoms on a statin, it is reasonable to try a different statin (Class IIa recommendation).

Option A, restarting rosuvastatin at a lower dose, may not be effective in reducing side effects and may still cause myalgias. Option B, initiating fenofibrate, is not a suitable choice as it is primarily used to treat hypertriglyceridemia, not high LDL. Option D, initiating fish oils, is not a recommended treatment for high LDL. Option E, not initiating any new lipid-lowering therapies, is not a suitable choice as the patient still requires LDL control to reduce cardiovascular risk.

Initiating a different statin (Option C) is the most appropriate next step in managing the patient's LDL levels while minimizing the risk of muscular side effects.",Success
An unidentified surgical specimen is received for histopathologic analysis. A portion of the specimen is cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The remainder is analyzed and is found to contains type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate. Which of the following structures is most likely the origin of this surgical specimen?,E,"The correct answer is B. Pinna.

Here's why:

The presence of type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate in the surgical specimen suggests that it is of cartilaginous origin. Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is composed of chondrocytes, which produce a matrix rich in type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate.

The pinna (also known as the auricle) is a cartilaginous structure that makes up the outer ear. It is composed of elastic cartilage, which is rich in type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate. This makes the pinna a likely origin for the surgical specimen.

The other options are not as likely:

A. Blood vessels are composed of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and connective tissue, but they do not contain type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate.

C. The pubic symphysis is a cartilaginous joint that connects the two pubic bones in the pelvis. While it does contain cartilage, it is a type of hyaline cartilage, which is different from the elastic cartilage found in the pinna.

D. The lens of the eye is a transparent, avascular structure composed of crystallin proteins and does not contain cartilage or type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate.

E. The larynx (voice box) does contain cartilage, but it is a type of hyaline cartilage, not elastic cartilage.

Therefore, based on the presence of type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate, the pinna is the most likely origin of the surgical specimen.",Success
"A 70-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for 1 day. Computed tomography shows a small bowel perforation. The patient is prepared for emergent exploratory laparotomy. She is sedated with midazolam, induced with propofol, intubated, and maintained on nitrous oxide and isoflurane for the duration of the surgery. A single perforation in the terminal ileum is diagnosed intraoperatively and successfully repaired. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit. The ventilator is set at an FiO2 of 50%, tidal volume of 1000 mL, respiratory rate of 12/min, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 2.5 cm H2O. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 111/50 mm Hg. She is responsive to painful stimuli. Lung examination shows bilateral rales. Abdominal examination shows a distended abdomen and intact abdominal surgical incisions. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis shows:
pH 7.44
pO2 54 mm Hg
pCO2 31 mm Hg
HCO3- 22 mm Hg
Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?""",D,"The correct answer is D. Increase PEEP.

Let's break down the patient's situation and the given options:

The patient is post-operative, intubated, and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.44, which is slightly alkalotic, but within the normal range. The pO2 is 54 mm Hg, which is low, indicating hypoxemia. The pCO2 is 31 mm Hg, which is within the normal range. The HCO3- is 22 mm Hg, which is within the normal range.

Given the patient's hypoxemia, the focus should be on improving oxygenation. The current ventilator settings are:

* FiO2: 50% (which is already relatively high)
* Tidal volume: 1000 mL (which is appropriate for an adult patient)
* Respiratory rate: 12/min (which is within the normal range)
* PEEP: 2.5 cm H2O (which is relatively low)

The patient's lung examination shows bilateral rales, which suggests the presence of pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In this scenario, increasing the PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) would be the most appropriate next step. PEEP helps to recruit alveoli, improve lung compliance, and increase oxygenation.

Increasing the FiO2 (option A) may not be effective in improving oxygenation, as the patient is already receiving a relatively high concentration of oxygen. Extubating the patient (option B) is not appropriate, given the patient's hypoxemia and need for mechanical ventilation. Increasing the tidal volume (option C) may not improve oxygenation and could potentially cause lung injury. Increasing the respiratory rate (option E) may not improve oxygenation and could lead to respiratory alkalosis.

Therefore, the best next step in the management of this patient is to increase the PEEP to improve oxygenation and lung mechanics.",Success
"A 43-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C and current intravenous drug use presents with 5 days of fever, chills, headache, and severe back pain. On physical exam, temperature is 100.6 deg F (38.1 deg C), blood pressure is 109/56 mmHg, pulse is 94/min, and respirations are 18/min. He is thin and diaphoretic with pinpoint pupils, poor dentition, and track marks on his arms and legs. A high-pitched systolic murmur is heard, loudest in the left sternal border and with inspiration. He is admitted to the hospital and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. One of the blood cultures drawn 12 hours ago returns positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is B. Repeat blood cultures 24 hours after initial cultures were drawn.

This patient's presentation is concerning for infective endocarditis (IE), given his history of intravenous drug use, fever, and a new murmur. The positive blood culture for Staphylococcus aureus 12 hours after admission supports this diagnosis. To confirm the diagnosis of IE, it is essential to obtain multiple positive blood cultures.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend that at least two sets of blood cultures be drawn 12-24 hours apart to confirm the diagnosis of IE. This is because a single positive blood culture may be due to contamination or bacteremia from another source.

Repeating blood cultures 24 hours after the initial cultures were drawn (Option B) is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of IE. This will help to determine if the initial positive culture was a true positive or a contaminant.

Options A, C, and D are incorrect because repeating blood cultures too soon (Option A) or too late (Options C and D) may not provide accurate information. Option E is also incorrect because not repeating blood cultures may lead to a missed diagnosis or delayed treatment.",Success
"A 42-year-old man with AIDS comes to the physician for intermittent fever, nonproductive cough, malaise, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and a 3.6-kg (8-lb) weight loss over the past month. He has not seen a doctor since he became uninsured 2 years ago. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F). Abdominal examination shows mild, diffuse tenderness throughout the lower quadrants. The liver is palpated 2–3 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpated 1–2 cm below the left costal margin. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 49/mm3 (N ≥ 500 mm3). Blood cultures grow acid-fast organisms. A PPD skin test shows 4 mm of induration. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Azithromycin and ethambutol.

The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and physical examination findings are consistent with disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, a common opportunistic infection in patients with advanced HIV/AIDS.

The growth of acid-fast organisms in blood cultures and the patient's low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count support this diagnosis. Although the PPD skin test result is not diagnostic for MAC infection, it suggests that the patient has been exposed to mycobacteria.

The most appropriate treatment for disseminated MAC infection is a combination of antibiotics that target MAC. The recommended regimen typically includes a macrolide antibiotic (such as azithromycin or clarithromycin) and ethambutol. This combination has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms, improving quality of life, and increasing survival in patients with disseminated MAC infection.

Option A, voriconazole, is an antifungal medication used to treat invasive aspergillosis and other fungal infections, but it is not effective against MAC.

Option B, amphotericin B and itraconazole, is a combination of antifungal medications used to treat invasive fungal infections, such as aspergillosis or histoplasmosis, but it is not indicated for MAC infection.

Option C, erythromycin, is a macrolide antibiotic, but it is not as effective as azithromycin or clarithromycin against MAC.

Option E, rifampin and isoniazid, is a combination of antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis, but it is not effective against MAC infection.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition is azithromycin and ethambutol (Option D).",Success
"A 49-year-old woman comes to the physician for a scheduled colposcopy. Two weeks ago, she had a routine Pap smear that showed atypical squamous cells. Colposcopy shows an area of white discoloration of the cervix with application of acetic acid solution. Biopsy of this area shows carcinoma-in-situ. Activation of which of the following best explains the pathogenesis of this condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. E2F transcription factors.

Here's why:

Carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) is a precursor lesion to invasive cervical cancer, and it's strongly associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV oncogenes, particularly E6 and E7, play a crucial role in the development of CIS.

E7 binds to and inactivates the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), leading to the release of E2F transcription factors. E2F transcription factors then stimulate the cell cycle, promoting cell proliferation and contributing to the development of CIS.

The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of CIS:

A. Phosphoprotein p24 is a protein associated with HIV, not cervical cancer.

B. JAK2 tyrosine kinase is involved in signaling pathways related to hematopoiesis and myeloproliferative disorders, not cervical cancer.

D. Phosphoprotein p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that's often mutated in various cancers, but it's not directly involved in the pathogenesis of CIS.

E. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, such as p21 and p27, are involved in cell cycle regulation, but they're not specifically linked to the development of CIS.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP), emphasize the importance of HPV infection and the role of E6 and E7 oncogenes in the development of cervical neoplasia, including CIS.",Success
"A research group has developed a low-cost diagnostic retinal imaging device for cytomegalovirus retinitis in a population of HIV-infected patients. In a pilot study of 50 patients, the imaging test detected the presence of CMV retinitis in 50% of the patients. An ophthalmologist slit lamp examination, which was performed for each patient to serve as the gold standard for diagnosis, confirmed a diagnosis of CMV retinitis in 20 patients that were found to be positive through imaging, as well as 1 patient who tested negative with the device. If the prevalence of CMV retinitis in the population decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, how will positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the diagnostic test be affected?",B,"The correct answer is B. PPV decreases, NPV increases.

Let's break it down:

Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is the probability that a patient with a positive test result truly has the disease. In this case, the PPV is the number of true positives (20) divided by the total number of positive test results (25), which is 20/25 = 0.8 or 80%.

Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is the probability that a patient with a negative test result truly does not have the disease. In this case, the NPV is the number of true negatives (24) divided by the total number of negative test results (25), which is 24/25 = 0.96 or 96%.

Now, if the prevalence of CMV retinitis in the population decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, the number of true positives will decrease, while the number of true negatives will increase. This means:

* The PPV will decrease because the number of false positives (5) will remain relatively constant, while the number of true positives decreases.
* The NPV will increase because the number of true negatives will increase, making the test more accurate in ruling out the disease.

Therefore, as the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases, the positive predictive value of the diagnostic test will decrease, and the negative predictive value will increase.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman is brought into the clinic by a concerned neighbor who says that the patient is often seen setting up bear traps all around her property because of an impending ‘invasion of the mole people.’ The patient has come to the clinic wearing a garlic necklace.

No significant past medical history. Although she has lived in the same community for years, she says she usually keeps to herself and does not have many friends. She holds a regular job at the local hardware store and lives alone. Which of the following is the best initial course of treatment for this patient?",A,"The correct answer is D. A brief trial of antipsychotic therapy.

The patient's behavior and beliefs, such as setting up bear traps to prevent an ""invasion of the mole people"" and wearing a garlic necklace to mask her scent, are indicative of a delusional disorder. Delusional disorders are a type of psychotic disorder characterized by the presence of non-bizarre delusions (i.e., delusions that are plausible, but not actually true) in the absence of other psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations.

The patient's lack of past psychiatric history, ability to hold a regular job, and lack of significant impairment in daily life suggest that she may be experiencing a brief psychotic episode or a delusional disorder. A brief trial of antipsychotic therapy, such as risperidone or olanzapine, may be effective in reducing the patient's delusional symptoms and improving her functioning.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) (Option A) may be a useful adjunctive treatment, but it is not the best initial course of treatment. CBT can help the patient identify and challenge her delusional beliefs, but it may not be effective in reducing symptoms quickly.

Option B is incorrect because the patient's delusional beliefs and behaviors are causing her distress and impairment, and she requires intervention.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (Option C) is not indicated for delusional disorders and is typically reserved for more severe and treatment-resistant cases of depression, catatonia, or schizophrenia.

Outpatient group therapy (Option E) may be a useful component of the patient's treatment plan, but it is not the best initial course of treatment. Group therapy can provide social support and help the patient develop coping skills, but it may not be effective in reducing her delusional symptoms quickly.",Success
A 71-year-old man complains of urinary hesitancy and nocturia of increasing frequency over the past several months. Digital rectal exam was positive for a slightly enlarged prostate but did not detect any additional abnormalities of the prostate or rectum. The patient’s serum PSA was measured to be 6 ng/mL. Image A shows a transabdominal ultrasound of the patient. Which of the following medications should be included to optimally treat the patient's condition?,B,"The correct answer is B. Finasteride.

The patient's symptoms of urinary hesitancy and nocturia, along with the digital rectal exam finding of a slightly enlarged prostate, suggest a diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The serum PSA level of 6 ng/mL is also consistent with this diagnosis.

Image A, which is not provided, likely shows an enlarged prostate on transabdominal ultrasound, further supporting the diagnosis of BPH.

Finasteride, a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, is a medication that is commonly used to treat BPH. It works by reducing the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent form of testosterone that contributes to prostate growth. By reducing DHT levels, finasteride can help to shrink the size of the prostate and alleviate symptoms of BPH.

The other options are not directly related to the treatment of BPH:

A. Clonidine is an antihypertensive medication that is not typically used to treat BPH.

C. Dihydrotestosterone is a hormone that contributes to prostate growth and is not a medication used to treat BPH.

D. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that is not typically used to treat BPH.

E. Furosemide is a diuretic that may be used to treat conditions such as heart failure or edema, but it is not typically used to treat BPH.

According to current medical guidelines, finasteride is a recommended medication for the treatment of BPH, particularly in patients with moderate to severe symptoms. The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend finasteride as a first-line therapy for BPH, along with alpha-blockers such as tamsulosin.",Success

His past medical history is noncontributory. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. The primary care provider recommends keeping a sleep journal and provides a questionnaire for the patient’s wife. The patient returns one month later to report no changes to his condition. The sleep journal reveals that the patient is getting sufficient sleep and wakes up rested. The questionnaire reveals that the patient does not snore nor does he stop breathing during his sleep. A sleep study reveals mean sleep latency of 6 minutes. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Methylphenidate.

The patient's symptoms, including excessive daytime sleepiness, falling asleep during meetings, and a mean sleep latency of 6 minutes on the sleep study, are consistent with a diagnosis of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness), and other symptoms.

Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant that is commonly used to treat narcolepsy. It helps to increase alertness and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends methylphenidate as a first-line treatment for narcolepsy.

Option B, sodium oxybate, is also used to treat narcolepsy, but it is typically reserved for patients with cataplexy, which is not mentioned in this patient's symptoms.

Option C, imipramine, is an antidepressant that may be used off-label to treat cataplexy, but it is not a first-line treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness.

Option D, increasing daytime naps, is not a recommended treatment for narcolepsy. While napping can help to improve alertness, it is not a substitute for pharmacological treatment in this case.

Option E, changing career, is not a relevant or effective treatment for narcolepsy. The patient's symptoms are not related to his job as a computer programmer, and changing careers would not address the underlying condition.

The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?",D,"The correct answer is D. Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a hydrocele, which is a fluid-filled sac surrounding the testicle. The key features that support this diagnosis are:

* The mass is soft, cystic, and nontender, which is consistent with a fluid-filled sac.
* The mass transilluminates, which means that light can pass through it, indicating that it is filled with clear fluid.
* The mass does not increase in size on coughing, which suggests that it is not related to increased abdominal pressure.
* The mass does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position, which suggests that it is not related to gravity.
* The examination of the testis shows no abnormalities, which suggests that the mass is not related to the testicle itself.

A hydrocele is caused by an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis, a layer of tissue that surrounds the testicle. This imbalance can lead to the accumulation of fluid in the space between the tunica vaginalis and the testicle, resulting in a hydrocele.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

* A patent processus vaginalis (Option A) would be associated with a hernia, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.
* Dilation of the pampiniform plexus (Option B) would be associated with varicoceles, which are enlarged veins in the scrotum, but the patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.
* Twisting of the spermatic cord (Option C) would be associated with testicular torsion, which is a surgical emergency that presents with severe pain and would not be consistent with the patient's painless symptoms.
* Impaired lymphatic drainage (Option E) is not a known cause of a hydrocele.

A 62-year-old man presents to the physician because of incomplete healing of a chest wound. He recently had a triple coronary artery bypass graft 3 weeks ago. His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the past 25 years. Clinical examination shows the presence of wound dehiscence in the lower 3rd of the sternal region. The wound surface shows the presence of dead necrotic tissue with pus. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax shows a small fluid collection with fat stranding in the perisurgical soft tissues. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of the patient?,A,"The correct answer is A. Surgical debridement.

Justification:

The patient presents with a non-healing chest wound with wound dehiscence, necrotic tissue, and pus, indicating a deep tissue infection. The CT scan shows a small fluid collection with fat stranding in the perisurgical soft tissues, suggesting a deep-seated infection. In this scenario, surgical debridement is the most appropriate next step in management.

Surgical debridement involves the removal of dead, damaged, or infected tissue from the wound to promote healing. This is especially important in this case, as the presence of necrotic tissue and pus indicates a severe infection that requires immediate attention. Debridement will help to remove the source of infection, reduce the bacterial load, and promote a clean environment for healing.

While negative pressure wound management (Option B) may be used as an adjunct therapy to promote wound healing, it is not the primary step in managing this patient's infection. Sternal dressings (Option C) are not sufficient to address the underlying infection and wound dehiscence. Sternal wiring (Option D) and sternal fixation (Option E) are surgical procedures that may be required to stabilize the sternum, but they are not the initial step in managing this patient's wound infection.

According to current medical guidelines, surgical debridement is a crucial step in the management of deep tissue infections, especially in patients with compromised wound healing, such as those with diabetes and hypertension.",Success
"The Kozak sequence for the Beta-globin gene has a known mutation which decreases, though does not abolish, translation of the Beta-globin mRNA, leading to a phenotype of thalassemia intermedia. What would the blood smear be expected to show in a patient positive for this mutation?",C,"The correct answer is C. Microcytic red blood cells.

The Kozak sequence is a region in the mRNA that serves as a binding site for ribosomes during translation initiation. A mutation in the Kozak sequence of the Beta-globin gene can lead to decreased translation of Beta-globin mRNA, resulting in a thalassemia intermedia phenotype.

Thalassemia intermedia is a genetic disorder characterized by reduced synthesis of Beta-globin chains, leading to anemia and microcytic red blood cells. The blood smear would be expected to show microcytic red blood cells, which are smaller than normal red blood cells.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Macrocytic red blood cells are typically seen in megaloblastic anemias, such as vitamin B12 deficiency or folate deficiency, not in thalassemia.

B. Hyperchromic red blood cells are not a characteristic feature of thalassemia. Hyperchromia refers to an increase in the concentration of hemoglobin within red blood cells, which is not typically seen in thalassemia.

D. Bite cells are a feature of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, not thalassemia.

E. Ringed sideroblasts are a feature of sideroblastic anemia, a disorder characterized by the accumulation of iron in the mitochondria of red blood cell precursors. This is not a characteristic feature of thalassemia.

It's essential to note that the diagnosis of thalassemia intermedia would require additional laboratory tests, including hemoglobin electrophoresis and genetic analysis, in addition to the blood smear findings.",Success
"A 68-year-old man from California presents for a routine checkup. He does not have any complaints. He says that he has tried to keep himself healthy and active by jogging and gardening since his retirement at age 50. He adds that he spends his mornings in the park and his afternoons in his garden. He has no significant medical history. The patient denies any smoking history and drinks alcohol occasionally. On physical examination, the following lesion is seen on his scalp (see image). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Actinic keratosis.

The image provided is not available, but based on the patient's history and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is actinic keratosis. Here's why:

* The patient is 68 years old, which puts him at an increased risk for skin lesions related to sun exposure.
* He spends his mornings in the park and afternoons in his garden, indicating prolonged sun exposure, especially on his scalp.
* The patient has no significant medical history, which makes it less likely that the lesion is related to an underlying condition.
* Actinic keratoses are common precancerous skin lesions that occur in sun-exposed areas, such as the scalp, face, and hands. They are often seen in older adults who have had extensive sun exposure.

While the other options are possible, they are less likely based on the patient's history and physical examination:

* A. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that typically presents with scaly, red plaques on the elbows, knees, and scalp. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest psoriasis.
* B. Seborrheic keratoses are benign skin growths that can occur anywhere on the body, but they are typically darker and more raised than actinic keratoses.
* C. Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can occur on sun-exposed areas, but it typically presents as a pearly or waxy nodule or a bleeding sore that does not heal.
* E. Squamous cell carcinoma is another type of skin cancer that can occur on sun-exposed areas, but it typically presents as a firm, red nodule or a sore that does not heal.

According to the American Academy of Dermatology, actinic keratoses are common precancerous skin lesions that can progress to squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated. Therefore, it is essential to diagnose and treat actinic keratoses promptly to prevent skin cancer.",Success
"A routine newborn screening test for phenylketonuria in a male neonate shows a serum phenylalanine concentration of 44 mg/dL (N < 20). He is started on a special diet and the hyperphenylalaninemia resolves. At a routine well-child examination 4 months later, the physician notices that he has persistent head lag. On examination, he has blue eyes, pale skin, blonde hair, and generalized hypotonia. His serum prolactin level is markedly elevated. Supplementation of which of the following substances is most likely to prevent further complications of this patient's condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Tetrahydrobiopterin.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) deficiency. BH4 is a cofactor necessary for the proper functioning of several enzymes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, including phenylalanine hydroxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, and tryptophan hydroxylase.

The elevated serum phenylalanine concentration at birth is indicative of hyperphenylalaninemia, which can be caused by phenylketonuria (PKU) or BH4 deficiency. The fact that the hyperphenylalaninemia resolved with dietary restriction suggests that the patient has BH4 deficiency rather than classic PKU.

The patient's physical characteristics, such as blue eyes, pale skin, and blonde hair, are consistent with BH4 deficiency, which is often associated with fair skin and hair. The generalized hypotonia and persistent head lag are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The elevated serum prolactin level is also a hallmark of BH4 deficiency, as BH4 is necessary for the synthesis of dopamine, which regulates prolactin secretion.

Supplementation with BH4 is likely to prevent further complications of this patient's condition, such as neurological deterioration, seizures, and intellectual disability.

Tyrosine (A) is an amino acid that is involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, but it is not a cofactor necessary for BH4-dependent enzymes. Pyridoxine (B) is a cofactor for certain enzymes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis, but it is not directly related to BH4 deficiency. Thiamine (C) is a cofactor for enzymes involved in energy metabolism, but it is not related to BH4 deficiency. Niacin (E) is a form of vitamin B3, but it is not directly related to BH4 deficiency.",Success
"A 36-year-old nursing home worker presents to the clinic with the complaints of breathlessness, cough, and night sweats for the past 2 months. She further expresses her concerns about the possibility of contracting tuberculosis as one of the patients under her care is being treated for tuberculosis. A PPD skin test is done and reads 11 mm on day 3. Chest X-ray demonstrates a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe. The standard anti-tuberculosis medication regimen is started. At a follow-up appointment 3 months later the patient presents with fatigue. She has also been experiencing occasional dizziness, weakness, and numbness in her feet. Physical exam is positive for conjunctival pallor. Lab work is significant for a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume of 68 fl. What is the most likely cause of her current symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is A. Decreased methionine synthesis.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, weakness, and numbness in her feet, along with conjunctival pallor and a low hemoglobin level (10 g/dL) and mean corpuscular volume (68 fl), suggest a diagnosis of anemia. Specifically, the patient is experiencing a microcytic anemia, which is characterized by small red blood cells.

The most likely cause of this anemia is isoniazid (INH), one of the medications used to treat tuberculosis. INH is known to cause a deficiency in vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), which is essential for the synthesis of methionine. Methionine is a crucial amino acid involved in the production of hemoglobin. Decreased methionine synthesis can lead to impaired hemoglobin production, resulting in microcytic anemia.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and the effects of INH:

B. Inhibition of ferrochelatase is related to the pathogenesis of porphyria, not tuberculosis or anemia.

C. Increased homocysteine degradation is not a known side effect of INH or a cause of microcytic anemia.

D. Increased GABA production is related to the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), which is not relevant to the patient's symptoms.

E. Decreased ALA (aminolevulinic acid) synthesis is related to the heme biosynthetic pathway, but it is not directly related to INH or microcytic anemia.

It's essential to monitor patients taking INH for signs of vitamin B6 deficiency and anemia, and to consider supplementing with vitamin B6 to prevent these complications.",Success
"A 23-year-old woman is referred to a genetic counselor. She is feeling well but is concerned because her brother was recently diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis. All first-degree relatives were encouraged to undergo genetic screening for any mutations associated with the disease. Today, she denies fever, chills, joint pain, or skin hyperpigmentation. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 123/78 mm Hg. Her physical examination is normal. Her serum iron, hemoglobin, ferritin, and AST and ALT concentrations are normal. Gene screening will involve a blood specimen. Which of the following genes would suggest hereditary hemochromatosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. HFE gene.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive iron absorption from the diet, leading to iron overload and deposition in various organs. The HFE gene, located on chromosome 6, is the primary gene associated with hereditary hemochromatosis. Mutations in the HFE gene, particularly the C282Y and H63D variants, are responsible for the majority of cases.

The HFE gene codes for a protein involved in regulating iron absorption in the small intestine. Mutations in this gene disrupt iron homeostasis, leading to increased iron absorption and subsequent iron overload.

The other options are not related to hereditary hemochromatosis:

A. BCR-ABL gene: associated with chronic myeloid leukemia

B. BRCA gene: associated with breast and ovarian cancer

C. FA gene: associated with Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic disorder

E. WAS gene: associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a rare X-linked recessive disorder affecting the immune system

In this scenario, genetic screening for HFE gene mutations would be the appropriate test to determine if the patient is at risk for hereditary hemochromatosis.",Success
"A 16-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with constant abdominal pain over the past 8 hours. The pain is in her right lower quadrant (RLQ), which is also where it began. She has had no nausea or vomiting despite eating a snack 2 hours ago. She had a similar episode last month which resolved on its own. Her menstrual cycles are 28–30 days apart with 3–5 days of vaginal bleeding. Her last menses ended 9 days ago. Her blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 78/min, the respirations are 15/min, and the temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F). Abdominal examination shows moderate pain on direct pressure over the RLQ which decreases with the release of pressure. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Reassurance.

Here's a justification for the choice:

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is mittelschmerz, a benign condition characterized by mid-cycle abdominal pain due to ovulation. The patient's history of similar episodes, particularly the timing of the pain in relation to her menstrual cycle (9 days after her last menses), supports this diagnosis.

The physical examination findings, including moderate pain on direct pressure over the RLQ that decreases with release of pressure, are consistent with mittelschmerz. The laboratory results, including a normal complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and urinalysis, do not suggest any signs of infection, inflammation, or other underlying conditions that would require further intervention.

Methotrexate (Option A) is a medication used to treat ectopic pregnancies, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms or laboratory results. Nitrofurantoin (Option B) is an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections, which is not indicated in this case. Referral for surgery (Option D) is not necessary, as the patient's symptoms are likely due to a benign condition. Tamsulosin (Option E) is a medication used to treat urinary retention, which is not relevant to the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is reassurance (Option C), as the patient's symptoms are likely due to mittelschmerz and do not require any further intervention at this time.",Success
"A 30-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a complaint of abdominal pain. The patient states he was at a barbecue around noon. Lunch was arranged as a buffet without refrigeration. Within 2 to 3 hours, he had abdominal pain with 3 episodes of watery diarrhea. On exam, vital signs are T 99.1, HR 103, BP 110/55, RR 14. Abdominal exam is significant for pain to deep palpation without any rebounding or guarding. There is no blood on fecal occult testing (FOBT). What is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?",C,"The correct answer is C. Staphylococcus aureus.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, particularly the rapid onset of abdominal pain and watery diarrhea within 2-3 hours of consuming food from a buffet without refrigeration, suggest a foodborne illness. The lack of blood on fecal occult testing (FOBT) and the absence of rebounding or guarding on abdominal exam also support this diagnosis.

Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of food poisoning, particularly in situations where food is not handled or stored properly. The bacteria produce enterotoxins that can cause symptoms within 1-6 hours of ingestion, which aligns with the patient's timeline. The symptoms are typically self-limiting and may resolve on their own within 24-48 hours.

Salmonella enteritidis (Option A) and Campylobacter jejuni (Option D) are also foodborne pathogens, but they typically have a longer incubation period (12-72 hours) and may cause more severe symptoms, including bloody diarrhea.

Listeria monocytogenes (Option B) is typically associated with more severe symptoms, including fever, headache, and stiff neck, and is more commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals or pregnant women.

Vibrio cholerae (Option E) is a bacterium that causes cholera, which is characterized by profuse, watery diarrhea and vomiting, often leading to dehydration. While it can be foodborne, it is less likely in this scenario given the patient's symptoms and the lack of severe dehydration.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the circumstances of the food consumption, Staphylococcus aureus is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation.",Success
"A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by staff of the group home where he resides because of worsening confusion for the past week.

While in the waiting room, he has a generalized, tonic-clonic seizure. Laboratory studies show a serum sodium of 119 mEq/L and an elevated serum antidiuretic hormone concentration. Which of the following sets of additional laboratory findings is most likely in this patient?
 $$$ Serum osmolality %%% Urine sodium %%% Serum aldosterone $$$",E,"The correct answer is D. ↓ ↑ ↑.

Let's break down the patient's presentation and laboratory findings to justify this choice:

* The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of ischemic stroke and major depressive disorder, taking aspirin and sertraline.
* He presents with worsening confusion, lethargy, and disorientation, which suggests a possible metabolic or electrolyte imbalance.
* The patient has a generalized tonic-clonic seizure in the waiting room, which is a red flag for a potential electrolyte disturbance.
* Laboratory studies show a serum sodium of 119 mEq/L, which is significantly low (normal range: 135-145 mEq/L). This suggests hyponatremia.
* The elevated serum antidiuretic hormone (ADH) concentration is consistent with the diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

Given these findings, we can expect the following additional laboratory results:

* Serum osmolality: ↓ (decreased) due to hyponatremia
* Urine sodium: ↑ (increased) because in SIADH, the kidneys retain sodium and water, leading to increased urine sodium excretion
* Serum aldosterone: ↑ (increased) as a response to the low serum sodium levels, which stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to increase aldosterone production

Therefore, the correct answer is D. ↓ ↑ ↑.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman presents with severe fear reactions to seeing dogs after moving into a new suburban neighborhood. She states that she has always had an irrational and excessive fear of dogs but has been able to avoid it for most of her life while living in the city. When she sees her neighbors walking their dogs outside, she is terrified and begins to feel short of breath. Recently, she has stopped picking up her children from the bus stop and no longer plays outside with her children in order to avoid seeing any dogs. Which of the following would be the best definitive treatment for this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Systematic desensitization.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with a specific phobia, specifically cynophobia (fear of dogs). Systematic desensitization is a type of exposure therapy that is highly effective in treating specific phobias. This technique involves gradually exposing the patient to the feared stimulus (in this case, dogs) in a controlled and safe environment, while teaching the patient relaxation techniques to manage their anxiety response.

Systematic desensitization is considered the definitive treatment for specific phobias because it addresses the underlying fear response and helps the patient to learn to cope with the feared stimulus. This approach has been shown to be highly effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and avoidance behaviors associated with specific phobias.

While SSRIs (option A) may be used to treat anxiety disorders, they are not a specific treatment for phobias and may not address the underlying fear response. Short-acting benzodiazepines (option B) may provide temporary relief from anxiety symptoms, but they are not a long-term solution and can be habit-forming. Cognitive behavioral therapy (option D) is a useful approach for addressing underlying thought patterns and behaviors, but it may not be as effective as systematic desensitization in treating specific phobias. Dialectical behavioral therapy (option E) is primarily used to treat borderline personality disorder and is not a specific treatment for phobias.

It's worth noting that a combination of treatments, including medication and therapy, may be necessary to effectively manage the patient's symptoms. However, systematic desensitization is a crucial component of treatment for specific phobias and should be considered the primary approach.",Success
"A 45-year-old man arrives by ambulance to the emergency room after being involved in a very severe construction accident. The patient was found unconscious with a large metal spike protruding from his abdomen by a coworker who was unable to estimate the amount of time the patient went without medical aid. Upon arrival to the ER, the patient was unconscious and unresponsive. His vital signs are BP: 80/40, HR: 120 bpm, RR: 25 bpm, Temperature: 97.1 degrees, and SPO2: 99%.He is taken to the operating room to remove the foreign body and control the bleeding. Although both objectives were accomplished, the patient had an acute drop in his blood pressure during the surgery at which time ST elevations were noted in multiple leads. This resolved with adequate fluid resuscitation and numerous blood transfusions. The patient remained sedated after surgery and continued to have relatively stable vital signs until his third day in the intensive care unit, when he experiences an oxygen desaturation of 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute. On auscultation air entry is present bilaterally with the presence of crackles. A 2/6 systolic murmur is heard. Readings from a Swan-Ganz catheter display the following: central venous pressure (CVP): 4 mmHg, right ventricular pressure (RVP) 20/5 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP): 20/5 mmHg. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP): 5 mm Hg. A chest x-ray is shown as Image A. The patient dies soon after this episode. What is the most likely direct cause of his death?",A,"The correct answer is A. Diffuse alveolar damage.

Here's a justification for the choice:

The patient's presentation in the emergency room suggests severe shock, likely due to hemorrhage from the abdominal injury. The surgical intervention and subsequent fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions helped to stabilize the patient. However, on the third day in the ICU, the patient experiences an oxygen desaturation episode, which is a critical clue.

The Swan-Ganz catheter readings provide valuable information:

* CVP (4 mmHg) is low, indicating hypovolemia or decreased right ventricular function.
* RVP (20/5 mmHg) and PAP (20/5 mmHg) are elevated, suggesting increased pulmonary vascular resistance.
* PCWP (5 mmHg) is low, which rules out left ventricular failure as the primary cause of the patient's symptoms.

The chest x-ray (Image A) likely shows bilateral infiltrates, consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Considering the patient's history of severe trauma, shock, and subsequent respiratory failure, the most likely direct cause of death is diffuse alveolar damage, which is a hallmark of ARDS. This is a common complication of severe trauma, shock, and sepsis.

The other options are less likely:

* B. Ventricular septal defect is not supported by the Swan-Ganz catheter readings or the patient's symptoms.
* C. Myocardial free wall rupture is possible, but the Swan-Ganz catheter readings and the patient's symptoms suggest a pulmonary rather than cardiac cause of death.
* D. Papillary muscle rupture is also possible, but the patient's symptoms and the Swan-Ganz catheter readings are more consistent with ARDS than a cardiac valvular problem.
* E. Myocardial reinfarction is unlikely, as the patient did not have a prior myocardial infarction, and the ST elevations during surgery were likely due to ischemia from hypovolemia and shock rather than a new infarction.",Success
"A 76-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents complaining of 3 weeks of cough and progressive dyspnea on exertion in the setting of a 20 pound weight loss. He is a 60 pack-year smoker, worked as a shipbuilder 30 years ago, and recently traveled to Ohio to visit family. Chest radiograph shows increased bronchovascular markings, reticular parenchymal opacities, and multiple pleural plaques. Labs are unremarkable except for a slight anemia. Which of the following is the most likely finding on this patient's chest CT?",E,"The correct answer is B. Honeycombing.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, medical history, and chest radiograph findings suggest a diagnosis of asbestosis, a type of interstitial lung disease caused by asbestos exposure. The presence of pleural plaques on the chest radiograph is a strong indicator of asbestos exposure, which is consistent with the patient's history of working as a shipbuilder 30 years ago.

Chest CT is a more sensitive and specific imaging modality than chest radiograph for evaluating interstitial lung disease. In asbestosis, chest CT typically shows honeycombing, which is a characteristic pattern of cystic spaces and fibrotic tissue that resembles a honeycomb. This finding is often seen in the lower lobes and is a hallmark of advanced asbestosis.

The other options are not as likely:

A. Nodular mass spreading along pleural surfaces is more consistent with malignant pleural mesothelioma, which is a rare tumor caused by asbestos exposure. While the patient's history of asbestos exposure increases his risk for this condition, the presence of pleural plaques and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with asbestosis.

C. Air bronchogram is a sign of consolidation or alveolar filling, which is not typical of asbestosis.

D. Granulomatous nodule is a feature of granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis or tuberculosis, which are not supported by the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings.

E. Lower lobe cavitary mass is more consistent with an infectious process, such as pneumonia or abscess, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and radiographic findings, honeycombing on chest CT is the most likely finding.",Success

Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilateral, a barrel-shaped chest, and measured breathing through pursed lips. A chest X-ray reveals a flattened diaphragm and no signs of consolidation. Pulmonary function testing reveals FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%. Arterial blood gases (ABG) of this patient are most likely to reveal which of the following?",B,"The correct answer is B. Primary respiratory acidosis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The chest X-ray findings of a flattened diaphragm and no signs of consolidation support this diagnosis. The pulmonary function testing result of an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% is also consistent with COPD.

In COPD, the patient's lungs have difficulty exhaling air, leading to a buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood. This results in respiratory acidosis, which is characterized by an increase in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) and a decrease in pH.

The arterial blood gas (ABG) results would likely show:

* pH < 7.35 (acidotic)
* PaCO2 > 45 mmHg (elevated)
* Bicarbonate (HCO3-) level may be normal or slightly elevated as a compensatory response to the respiratory acidosis

The other options are not correct:

A. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and ABG results.

C. Primary respiratory alkalosis would result from hyperventilation, leading to a decrease in PaCO2 and an increase in pH, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and ABG results.

D. Compensatory respiratory acidosis is not a primary acid-base disorder, but rather a compensatory response to metabolic alkalosis.

E. Anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and ABG results, and would require a different set of underlying conditions.

In summary, the patient's ABG results are most likely to reveal primary respiratory acidosis, characterized by an increase in PaCO2 and a decrease in pH, consistent with COPD.",Success
A 34-year-old male suffers from inherited hemophilia A. He and his wife have three unaffected daughters. What is the probability that the second daughter is a carrier of the disease?,E,"The correct answer is C. 50%.

Explanation:

Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder, which means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes, while males have one X and one Y chromosome.

Since the father has hemophilia A, he has the mutated gene on his X chromosome. Each of his daughters inherits one X chromosome from him, which means they inherit the mutated gene. However, they also inherit a normal X chromosome from their mother, making them carriers of the disease but not affected themselves.

The probability of each daughter being a carrier is independent of the others. Since each daughter has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutated X chromosome from their father, the probability that the second daughter is a carrier is also 50%.

The other options are incorrect:

A. 0%: The daughters are not unaffected by chance; they are carriers of the disease due to their father's genotype.

B. 25%: This probability would be correct if the father were a carrier, but he has the disease, making his daughters carriers.

D. 75%: This probability is incorrect, as each daughter has an independent 50% chance of being a carrier.

E. 100%: While it is certain that each daughter is a carrier, the probability of the second daughter being a carrier is still 50%, not 100%.",Success

The patient is unable to repeat the sentence said to him on whisper testing. When a vibrating tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, it is heard equally on both ears. When the vibrating tuning fork is placed by the ear and then on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Which of the following structures is most likely impaired in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Cochlea.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a sensorineural hearing loss, which is a type of permanent hearing loss that affects the inner ear or the auditory nerve. The key indicators of sensorineural hearing loss in this patient are:

1. Progressive hearing loss over 10 years, which is consistent with age-related hearing loss (presbycusis).
2. Difficulty understanding speech, especially in noisy environments, which is a hallmark of sensorineural hearing loss.
3. Constant ear ringing (tinnitus), which is a common symptom of cochlear damage.
4. Episodes of unsteadiness, which may be related to vestibular dysfunction, also associated with cochlear damage.
5. Normal otoscopic findings, which rule out conductive hearing loss due to middle ear problems.
6. The results of the tuning fork tests:
	* The Weber test (vibrating fork on the forehead) shows equal hearing in both ears, which suggests that the problem is not related to the middle ear or the auditory nerve.
	* The Rinne test (vibrating fork by the ear and then on the mastoid process) shows air conduction greater than bone conduction, which is consistent with sensorineural hearing loss.

The cochlea is the structure responsible for converting sound vibrations into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. Damage to the cochlea, such as that caused by age-related hearing loss, can lead to sensorineural hearing loss.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Tympanic membrane: Damage to the tympanic membrane would cause conductive hearing loss, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

B. Malleus: The malleus is one of the ossicles in the middle ear, and damage to it would also cause conductive hearing loss.

C. Incus: Similar to the malleus, damage to the incus would cause conductive hearing loss.

D. Stapes: While the stapes is also an ossicle in the middle ear, damage to it would cause conductive hearing loss, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is E. Cochlea.",Success

Gram-negative, non-maltose fermenting diplococci.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as severe eye pain, blurry vision, and purulent discharge, are consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial keratitis, a serious infection of the cornea. The fact that he wears soft contact lenses and hasn't removed them for 2 days increases the risk of infection.

Given the patient's symptoms and the initiation of treatment with topical ciprofloxacin, the most likely causative organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This Gram-negative bacterium is a common cause of contact lens-related keratitis and is known to produce severe corneal ulcers.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is characterized as a Gram-negative, non-maltose fermenting diplococcus, which matches option A.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

B. Gram-positive, bacitracin-sensitive cocci: This description is more consistent with Streptococcus pyogenes, which is not typically associated with contact lens-related keratitis.

C. Gram-negative, lactose-fermenting bacilli: This description is more consistent with Enterobacteriaceae, such as E. coli, which are not typically associated with contact lens-related keratitis.

D. Gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacilli: This description is more consistent with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but the question specifies ""non-maltose fermenting"", which is not consistent with this option.

E. Gram-positive, optochin-sensitive diplococci: This description is more consistent with Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is not typically associated with contact lens-related keratitis.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS), a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). The MRI study (Figure 1) likely shows demyelinating lesions in the brain, which further supports the diagnosis of MS.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is often used to support the diagnosis of MS. In MS, the CSF typically shows evidence of intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis, which is characterized by the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands on electrophoresis. These bands are not present in the serum, indicating that they are produced locally in the CNS. This finding is highly specific for MS and is often used as a diagnostic criterion.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. The 14-3-3 protein is a marker for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a prion disease that causes rapid neurodegeneration. It is not typically associated with MS.

B. Decreased glucose with neutrophilic predominance is more consistent with bacterial meningitis, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings.

D. Decreased IgG CSF concentration is not a characteristic finding in MS. In fact, the IgG index is often elevated in MS due to intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis.

E. Albuminocytologic dissociation is a finding seen in Guillain-Barré syndrome, a peripheral nervous system disorder characterized by acute inflammatory demyelination. It is not typically associated with MS.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and the American Academy of Neurology, recommend CSF analysis as a diagnostic tool for MS, and the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands is a key diagnostic criterion.",Success
"A 22-year-old primigravida presents for a regular prenatal visit at 16 weeks gestation. She is concerned about the results of a dipstick test she performed at home, which showed 1+ glucose. She does not know  if her liquid consumption has increased, but she urinates more frequently than before. The course of her pregnancy has been unremarkable and she has no significant co-morbidities. The BMI is 25.6 kg/cm2 and she has gained 3 kg (6.72 lb) during the pregnancy. The blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, the heart rate is 82/min, the respiratory rate is 14/min, and the temperature is 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The lungs are clear to auscultation, the heart sounds are normal with no murmurs, and there is no abdominal or costovertebral angle tenderness. The laboratory tests show the following results:
Fasting glucose 97 mg/L
ALT 12 IU/L
AST 14 IU/L
Total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL(15 µmol/L)
Plasma creatinine 0.7 mg/dL (61.9 µmol/L)
Which of the following tests are indicated to determine the cause of the abnormal dipstick test results?",B,"The correct answer is C. Urinalysis.

Here's why:

The patient's concern is about the 1+ glucose result on a dipstick test, which suggests possible glucosuria (glucose in the urine). The dipstick test is a screening tool, and a positive result requires further evaluation to determine the cause. 

The patient's fasting glucose level of 97 mg/dL is within the normal range, which makes it unlikely that she has diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. 

Given the patient's symptoms of frequent urination and the abnormal dipstick test result, the next step is to perform a urinalysis to evaluate for other possible causes of glucosuria, such as:

1. Benign glucosuria: a common condition in pregnancy where the renal threshold for glucose is lowered, leading to glucose in the urine.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): which can cause glucosuria.
3. Other renal or metabolic disorders.

Urinalysis can help identify the underlying cause of the abnormal dipstick test result and guide further management.

The other options are not correct because:

A. HbA1c measurement is used to diagnose and monitor diabetes, but it's not indicated in this scenario since the patient's fasting glucose is normal.

B. No tests required is incorrect because the abnormal dipstick test result needs to be further evaluated to determine the cause.

D. Oral glucose tolerance test is used to diagnose gestational diabetes, but it's not indicated at this point since the patient's fasting glucose is normal and there's no other indication for gestational diabetes screening.

E. Random plasma glucose is not a suitable test to evaluate the cause of glucosuria, and it's not a reliable indicator of glucose tolerance.",Success
A 9-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of intermittent watery diarrhea for several months. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. He was diagnosed with eczematous dermatitis at 3 months old. His height and weight are below the 5th percentile. Immunologic evaluation shows a defect in activated regulatory T cells. A genetic analysis shows a mutation in the FOXP3 gene. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following?,C,"The correct answer is C. Autoimmune endocrinopathy.

The patient's symptoms and genetic analysis are consistent with IPEX (Immune dysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, X-linked) syndrome, a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the FOXP3 gene. FOXP3 is a transcription factor essential for the development and function of regulatory T cells, which play a crucial role in maintaining immune tolerance.

IPEX syndrome is characterized by immune dysregulation, autoimmune disorders, and multisystem involvement. The patient's symptoms, including eczematous dermatitis, diarrhea, and failure to thrive, are consistent with this diagnosis.

Autoimmune endocrinopathy, particularly thyroiditis and adrenal insufficiency, is a common complication of IPEX syndrome. The immune system mistakenly attacks the endocrine glands, leading to hormonal imbalances and endocrine disorders.

The other options are not directly related to IPEX syndrome or FOXP3 mutations:

A. Hemorrhagic diathesis is not a characteristic feature of IPEX syndrome.

B. Ocular telangiectasias are a hallmark of ataxia-telangiectasia, a different genetic disorder.

D. Retained primary teeth are a feature of ectodermal dysplasias, unrelated to IPEX syndrome.

E. Anaphylaxis to blood transfusions is not a known complication of IPEX syndrome.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and genetic analysis point to IPEX syndrome, which increases the risk of autoimmune endocrinopathy.",Success
"A 57-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of abdominal bloating and increased frequency of stools. He describes the stools as bulky, foul-smelling, and difficult to flush. He also has a 4-month history of recurrent dull upper abdominal pain that usually lasts for a few days, worsens after meals, and is not relieved with antacids. He has had a 10-kg (22-lb) weight loss in the past 4 months. He has no personal or family history of serious illness. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 37 years. He has a 12-year history of drinking 6 to 8 beers daily. He is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 52 kg (115 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m2. His vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination shows mild epigastric tenderness without rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is C. Abdominal ultrasound.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms suggest a possible pancreatic disorder, such as chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. The abdominal bloating, increased frequency of stools, and bulky, foul-smelling stools are consistent with malabsorption, which can occur due to pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. The recurrent upper abdominal pain, weight loss, and history of smoking and heavy alcohol consumption also support this suspicion.

Given the patient's symptoms and risk factors, an abdominal ultrasound is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis. Ultrasound is a non-invasive, relatively inexpensive, and widely available imaging modality that can help evaluate the pancreas and surrounding structures. It can detect pancreatic calcifications, ductal dilatation, and masses, which are common findings in chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.

While an abdominal CT scan (Option A) may also be useful in evaluating the pancreas, it is a more expensive and higher-radiation imaging modality that is not necessary as an initial diagnostic step. Endoscopic ultrasonography (Option B) is a more invasive procedure that is typically reserved for further evaluation of suspected pancreatic lesions or for tissue sampling. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (Option D) may be useful in evaluating the upper GI tract, but it is not the most appropriate initial test for evaluating the pancreas. Abdominal x-ray (Option E) is not a sensitive test for evaluating the pancreas and would not provide useful information in this case.

According to the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines, ultrasound is a recommended initial imaging test for suspected chronic pancreatitis. The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) also recommends ultrasound as a first-line imaging modality for evaluating pancreatic lesions.",Success
"A 67-year-old white man presents to his primary care provider for an annual examination. He notes a pink bump that has rapidly developed on his forehead over the last month. In the past, he has had significant sun exposure including multiple blistering sunburns. The physical examination reveals a 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug (as shown in the image). Excisional biopsy of the lesion reveals an exophytic nodule with central invagination, full of keratin. Keratinocyte atypia is minimal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Keratoacanthoma.

Here's why:

The patient's history of significant sun exposure, including multiple blistering sunburns, increases his risk of developing skin lesions. The physical examination reveals a 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug, which is a characteristic feature of keratoacanthoma. The excisional biopsy findings of an exophytic nodule with central invagination, full of keratin, and minimal keratinocyte atypia further support this diagnosis.

Keratoacanthoma is a benign skin tumor that typically appears as a rapidly growing, dome-shaped or crater-like lesion with a central keratin plug. It is often seen in older adults with a history of sun exposure. The lesion can grow rapidly, but it usually resolves on its own within a few months.

In contrast:

* Basal cell carcinoma (Option B) typically presents as a slow-growing, shiny, or pearly nodule, often with telangiectasias. While it can occur on sun-exposed areas, the rapid growth and central keratin plug are not characteristic features.
* Seborrheic keratosis (Option C) is a benign skin growth that appears as a dark, raised, or flat lesion. It does not typically have a central keratin plug or rapid growth.
* Molluscum contagiosum (Option D) is a viral infection that causes small, painless bumps on the skin. It is not typically associated with sun exposure or a central keratin plug.
* Kaposi's sarcoma (Option E) is a type of cancer that occurs in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS. It typically presents as multiple, painless, purple or brown lesions on the skin.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy findings, keratoacanthoma is the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 56-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor with intermittent chest pain. He reports a 2-month history of exertional chest pain that commonly arises after walking 5 or more blocks. He describes the pain as dull, burning, non-radiating substernal pain. His past medical history is notable for hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. He takes simvastatin and losartan. His temperature is 98.9°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 150/85 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, he is well-appearing and in no acute distress. S1 and S2 are normal. No murmurs are noted. An exercise stress test is performed to further evaluate the patient’s pain. Which of the following substances is released locally to increase coronary blood flow during exertion?",A,"The correct answer is A. Adenosine.

During exertion, the heart requires increased oxygen delivery to meet its increased energy demands. To achieve this, coronary blood flow must increase. Adenosine is a locally released substance that plays a key role in this process. It is a potent vasodilator that is produced by cardiac myocytes in response to increased activity and decreased oxygen delivery. Adenosine binds to specific receptors on coronary artery smooth muscle cells, causing relaxation and vasodilation, which increases coronary blood flow and oxygen delivery to the myocardium.

The other options are not directly involved in increasing coronary blood flow during exertion:

B. Inorganic phosphate is a byproduct of ATP hydrolysis and is not directly involved in regulating coronary blood flow.

C. Norepinephrine is a sympathetic neurotransmitter that can increase heart rate and contractility, but it is a vasoconstrictor and would actually decrease coronary blood flow.

D. Prostaglandin E2 is a vasodilator, but it is not specifically involved in regulating coronary blood flow during exertion.

E. Transforming growth factor beta is a cytokine involved in cell growth and differentiation, but it is not related to coronary blood flow regulation.

It's worth noting that the patient's symptoms and exercise stress test results are consistent with stable angina, which is a common presentation of coronary artery disease. The patient's primary care doctor may consider further evaluation and management, such as cardiac catheterization or medical therapy, to address the underlying coronary artery disease.",Success
"A 69-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma on chemotherapy presents to his oncologist for a follow-up visit. He has responded well to etoposide and cisplatin with plans to undergo radiation therapy. However, he reports that he recently developed multiple “spots” all over his body. He denies any overt bleeding from his gums or joint swelling. His past medical history is notable for iron deficiency anemia, osteoarthritis, and paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton syndrome. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, a rash is noted diffusely across the patient’s trunk and bilateral upper and lower extremities.

Results from a complete blood count are shown below:
Hemoglobin: 11.9 mg/dl
Hematocrit: 35%
Leukocyte count: 5,000/mm^3
Platelet count: 20,000/mm^3

The oncologist would like to continue chemotherapy but is concerned that the above results will limit the optimal dose and frequency of the regimen. A recombinant version of which of the following is most appropriate in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is E. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).

The patient's complete blood count (CBC) results show a low platelet count of 20,000/mm³, indicating thrombocytopenia. This is a common side effect of chemotherapy, particularly with cisplatin. The oncologist is concerned that the patient's thrombocytopenia may limit the optimal dose and frequency of the chemotherapy regimen.

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a recombinant cytokine that stimulates the production of granulocytes, including platelets, in the bone marrow. It is commonly used to support patients receiving chemotherapy, particularly those with a high risk of febrile neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. G-CSF can help to increase the platelet count, reducing the risk of bleeding complications and allowing for optimal chemotherapy dosing.

Interleukin 2 (A) is not directly related to platelet production or chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. Interleukin 8 (B) is a chemokine involved in inflammation, but it is not relevant to this patient's situation. Interleukin 11 (C) is a cytokine that can stimulate platelet production, but it is not as commonly used as G-CSF for this purpose. Erythropoietin (D) is a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production, but it would not address the patient's thrombocytopenia.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), recommend the use of G-CSF in patients receiving chemotherapy who are at high risk of febrile neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.",Success
"A 60-year-old man with a history of osteoarthritis has been awaiting hip replacement surgery for 3 years. During his annual physical, he reports that he has been taking over the counter pain medications, but that no amount of analgesics can relieve his constant pain. Laboratory results reveal that his renal function has deteriorated when compared to his last office visit 2 years ago. Serum creatinine is 2.0 mg/dL, and urinalysis shows 1+ proteinuria. There are no abnormalities seen on microscopy of the urine. A renal biopsy shows eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's deterioration in renal function?",D,"The correct answer is D. Toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis.

Here's why:

The patient's history of taking over-the-counter pain medications for an extended period, along with the laboratory results showing deteriorated renal function, suggests a toxic effect on the kidneys. The presence of eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation on renal biopsy is consistent with an allergic or toxic reaction.

Toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis is a type of acute kidney injury caused by a toxic reaction to medications, in this case, likely the over-the-counter pain medications. This condition is characterized by inflammation and damage to the tubules and interstitium of the kidneys, leading to impaired renal function.

The other options are not as likely:

A. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a type of glomerular disease that typically presents with proteinuria, but it is not typically associated with eosinophilic infiltration or a history of medication use.

B. Ischemic acute tubular necrosis is a type of acute kidney injury caused by inadequate blood flow to the kidneys, but it is not typically associated with eosinophilic infiltration or proteinuria.

C. Nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis is a type of acute kidney injury caused by direct toxicity to the tubules, but it is typically associated with a more severe and rapid decline in renal function, and the presence of eosinophilic infiltration is not typical.

E. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is a type of glomerular disease that typically presents with a rapid decline in renal function, but it is not typically associated with eosinophilic infiltration or a history of medication use.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the National Kidney Foundation, recommend considering toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis in patients with acute kidney injury and a history of medication use, especially with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other nephrotoxic agents.",Success
"A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath. The patient says he feels as if he is unable to take a deep breath. The patient has a past medical history of COPD and a 44-pack-year smoking history. The patient has been admitted before for a similar presentation. His temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 123/min, respirations are 33/min, and oxygen saturation is 80% on room air. The patient is started on 100% oxygen, albuterol, ipratropium, magnesium, and prednisone. The patient claims he is still short of breath. Physical exam reveals bilateral wheezes and poor air movement. His oxygen saturation is 80%. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. BiPAP.

The patient's presentation is consistent with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and oxygen saturation level suggest respiratory distress. Despite being started on bronchodilators, steroids, and oxygen therapy, the patient remains short of breath.

BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) is a non-invasive ventilation strategy that can help improve oxygenation and reduce respiratory distress in patients with COPD exacerbations. It is recommended as a first-line intervention in patients with acute COPD exacerbations who have respiratory acidosis or severe respiratory distress (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, 2020).

Intubation (option D) may be necessary if the patient's respiratory status continues to deteriorate, but it is not the best next step in management at this point. BiPAP is a less invasive and potentially more effective intervention for this patient.

A chest radiograph (option B) may be useful in evaluating for potential complications such as pneumonia or pneumothorax, but it is not the most urgent next step in management.

Chest tube placement (option C) is not indicated in this scenario, as there is no evidence of a pneumothorax.

Needle decompression (option E) is a procedure used to treat a tension pneumothorax, which is not suspected in this patient based on the information provided.

In summary, BiPAP is the best next step in management for this patient, as it can help improve oxygenation and reduce respiratory distress in a patient with an acute COPD exacerbation.",Success
"A 76-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of low back pain and weakness for the past 4 weeks.

Sensory examination shows decreased sensation to pinprick below the T4 dermatome. He is unable to lie recumbent due to severe pain. An x-ray of the chest shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy.

This patient presents with a classic case of spinal cord compression, likely due to metastatic cancer. The symptoms and signs point to a malignant process:

* Low back pain with radiation to the left side and a burning quality, suggesting nerve root involvement
* Weakness in the lower extremities (3/5 strength)
* Hyperreflexia and bilateral Babinski sign, indicating upper motor neuron signs
* Decreased sensation to pinprick below the T4 dermatome, suggesting spinal cord compression
* Inability to walk without assistance and difficulty with urination and constipation, indicating significant neurological impairment
* Chest x-ray showing multiple round opacities in both lungs, suggestive of metastatic disease

Given the patient's severe symptoms and signs of spinal cord compression, immediate management is crucial. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy is the most appropriate next step to reduce spinal cord edema and alleviate compression. This is a standard treatment approach for spinal cord compression due to metastatic disease (National Comprehensive Cancer Network, 2022).

Radiation therapy (Option A) may be considered later as part of a comprehensive treatment plan, but it is not the most immediate priority.

Intravenous acyclovir therapy (Option C) is not indicated, as there is no evidence of herpes simplex virus infection.

Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy (Option D) may be considered if there is suspicion of an underlying infection, but it is not the primary concern in this case.

Oral ibuprofen therapy (Option E) is insufficient to address the patient's severe symptoms and signs of spinal cord compression.

It is essential to note that further diagnostic workup, including imaging studies (e.g., MRI) and biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. However, in the acute setting, intravenous dexamethasone therapy is the most appropriate next step.",Success

He recognizes that his fear is irrational. He is upset that it is affecting his relationship with his wife. Additionally, his current job may soon require employees in his sales position to fly to meet potential clients. He is embarrassed to have a conversation with his manager about his fear of flying. Which of the following is the best therapy for the patient’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

The patient's symptoms are consistent with a specific phobia, in this case, aviophobia or fear of flying. The patient's avoidance of flying has significantly impacted his personal and professional life, and he is motivated to overcome his fear.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a highly effective treatment for specific phobias, including aviophobia. CBT helps the patient identify and challenge negative thoughts and behaviors associated with their fear, and learn coping skills to manage anxiety in the presence of the feared stimulus (flying). Exposure therapy, a component of CBT, involves gradually and safely exposing the patient to the feared situation (flying) to help them become desensitized to the anxiety response.

The other options are not the best therapy for the patient's condition:

A. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that can provide short-term relief from anxiety, but it is not a long-term solution and can be habit-forming. It does not address the underlying causes of the phobia and can even interfere with the effectiveness of CBT.

C. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant that may be used to treat anxiety disorders, but it is not specifically indicated for treating phobias. Additionally, it may take several weeks to take effect, and the patient is seeking a more immediate solution.

D. Psychodynamic psychotherapy may help the patient understand the underlying causes of their phobia, but it is a less effective treatment for specific phobias compared to CBT.

E. Zolpidem is a sedative-hypnotic medication used to treat insomnia, and it is not indicated for treating anxiety disorders or phobias.

"A 75-year-old man presents to a medical clinic for evaluation of a large, tense, pruritic bulla on his inner thighs, abdomen, and lower abdomen. A skin biopsy is performed, which shows an epidermal basement membrane with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and linear immunofluorescence. Which of the following is the most likely cell junction to which the antibodies bind?",D,"The correct answer is D. Hemidesmosomes.

The patient's symptoms and skin biopsy results are consistent with a diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid, a rare autoimmune skin disorder characterized by the formation of large, tense blisters on the skin.

The linear immunofluorescence pattern on the skin biopsy, which shows IgG antibodies bound to the epidermal basement membrane, is a hallmark feature of bullous pemphigoid. The antibodies in bullous pemphigoid target the hemidesmosomal proteins BP180 and BP230, which are essential for the adhesion of epidermal keratinocytes to the basement membrane.

Hemidesmosomes are a type of cell junction that anchors the epidermis to the dermis, and they play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the skin. The binding of IgG antibodies to hemidesmosomes disrupts this adhesion, leading to the formation of blisters.

The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of bullous pemphigoid:

A. Adherens junctions are involved in cell-cell adhesion, but they are not the primary target of antibodies in bullous pemphigoid.

B. Desmosomes are also involved in cell-cell adhesion, but they are not specifically targeted by antibodies in bullous pemphigoid.

C. Gap junctions are involved in cell-cell communication, but they are not related to the pathogenesis of bullous pemphigoid.

E. Tight junctions are involved in forming a barrier between cells, but they are not the primary target of antibodies in bullous pemphigoid.

On mental status examination, her thought process is organized and logical. Her affect is flat. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Schizoid personality disorder.

Here's why:

* The patient's behavior, as described, is consistent with schizoid personality disorder. She avoids social interactions, has no friends, and prefers to spend time alone reading. This lack of interest in social relationships and preference for solitary activities is a hallmark of schizoid personality disorder.
* Her organized and logical thought process on mental status examination rules out schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder (option D), which are characterized by disorganized thinking and other psychotic symptoms.
* The flat affect (emotional tone) is also consistent with schizoid personality disorder, as individuals with this condition often exhibit a restricted range of emotions.
* Antisocial personality disorder (option C) is characterized by a disregard for others' rights and a tendency to engage in impulsive and irresponsible behavior, which is not described in this scenario.
* Autism spectrum disorder (option E) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. While some individuals with autism spectrum disorder may prefer solitary activities, the patient's behavior in this scenario is more consistent with schizoid personality disorder, which is a personality disorder rather than a neurodevelopmental disorder.
* Schizotypal personality disorder (option B) is characterized by eccentric behavior, odd speech, and magical thinking, which are not described in this scenario.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), schizoid personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of emotional expression.

There are decreased breath sounds and crackles heard over the upper right lung field. His hemoglobin concentration is 13.3 g/dL, leukocyte count is 15,000/mm3, and platelet count is 289,000/mm3. An x-ray of the chest shows a right upper-lobe infiltrate. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is B. Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as a high-grade fever, cough, and shortness of breath, are consistent with pneumonia. The chest x-ray showing a right upper-lobe infiltrate further supports this diagnosis.

The patient's history of a sore throat and generalized aches 10 days prior to admission, which initially improved but then worsened, suggests a possible viral or atypical bacterial infection. The fact that the patient's symptoms relapsed after an initial improvement is also consistent with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adolescents and young adults, and it can present with a range of symptoms, including fever, cough, and malaise. The patient's age, symptoms, and chest x-ray findings are all consistent with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.

While Streptococcus pneumoniae (Option A) is a common cause of CAP, the patient's symptoms and history are less consistent with this diagnosis. Streptococcus pneumoniae typically presents with a more acute onset of symptoms, and the patient's history of a sore throat and generalized aches 10 days prior to admission is less typical of this infection.

Staphylococcus aureus (Option C) is a possible cause of CAP, particularly in patients with underlying medical conditions or risk factors. However, the patient's symptoms and history are not consistent with this diagnosis, and the chest x-ray findings are less typical of Staphylococcus aureus infection.

Chlamydophila pneumoniae (Option D) is another atypical bacterial pathogen that can cause CAP, but it is less common than Mycoplasma pneumoniae in this age group, and the patient's symptoms and history are less consistent with this diagnosis.

Haemophilus influenzae (Option E) is a common cause of CAP in children, but it is less common in adolescents and young adults, and the patient's symptoms and history are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, history, and chest x-ray findings, Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.",Success

Medication is prescribed for his symptoms which changes his cardiac physiology as depicted with the dashed line recorded post-medication. What is the mechanism of action of the prescribed medication?",B,"The correct answer is C. Preferential dilatation of capacitance vessels.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest heart failure, likely due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The S3 gallop rhythm, distended neck veins, and bilateral pitting edema are all indicative of volume overload. The medication prescribed has changed the cardiac physiology, as depicted by the dashed line, which suggests a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and an increase in stroke volume.

The mechanism of action of the prescribed medication is likely a vasodilator, which preferentially dilates capacitance vessels (veins). This reduces venous return to the heart, thereby decreasing LVEDP and alleviating symptoms of volume overload. The increased stroke volume is likely due to the decreased afterload, allowing the heart to pump more efficiently.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Decrease in the slope of the pacemaker potential: This would affect the heart rate, not the cardiac physiology depicted in the graph.

B. Decrease in transmembrane sodium gradient: This is not a mechanism of action that would directly affect cardiac physiology in this scenario.

D. Inhibition of aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption: While this could lead to diuresis and decreased volume overload, it would not directly affect cardiac physiology in the way depicted in the graph.

E. Reduction in myocardial contractility: This would actually worsen heart failure symptoms, not improve them.

The prescribed medication is likely a vasodilator, such as nitroglycerin or nesiritide, which is commonly used to treat acute heart failure.",Success
"A 30-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of excessive fatigue and weakness for the last several weeks. He also complains of abdominal pain and constipation for the same duration. On further questioning, he reports that he has lost 8 pounds in the last 2 weeks. Past medical history and family history are insignificant. His temperature is 37.3° C (99.2° F), respirations are 21/min, pulse is 63/min, and blood pressure is 99/70 mm Hg. On physical examination, he is a tired-appearing, thin male. He has a bronze discoloration to his skin, but he denies being outside in the sun or any history of laying in tanning beds. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?",D,"The correct answer is E. Order an ACTH stimulation test.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as excessive fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, and weight loss, are nonspecific but suggest a possible endocrine disorder. The bronze discoloration of the skin, also known as hyperpigmentation, is a key finding that points towards adrenal insufficiency, specifically Addison's disease. This is because the adrenal glands produce melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which can cause hyperpigmentation when levels are elevated.

Before initiating treatment, it's essential to confirm the diagnosis. An ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) stimulation test is the next best step in the management of this patient. This test measures the response of the adrenal glands to ACTH, which stimulates the production of cortisol. In Addison's disease, the adrenal glands do not respond to ACTH, and cortisol levels remain low.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Administering intravenous hydrocortisone without a confirmed diagnosis may mask the underlying condition and make it more challenging to diagnose.

B. Fludrocortisone is a mineralocorticoid that is used to treat adrenal insufficiency, but it's not the first step in diagnosis or management.

C. Androgen replacement therapy is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient's symptoms do not suggest hypogonadism.

D. Starting both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy without a confirmed diagnosis is premature and may lead to unnecessary treatment.

By ordering an ACTH stimulation test, the physician can confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency and then initiate appropriate treatment.",Success
A 27-year-old HIV positive female gave birth to a 7lb 2oz (3.2 kg) baby girl. The obstetrician is worried that the child may have been infected due to the mother's haphazard use of her anti-retroviral medications. Which of the following assays would a hospital use detect the genetic material of HIV if the child had been infected?,D,"The correct answer is D. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Here's why:

In this scenario, the concern is that the newborn may have been infected with HIV due to the mother's inconsistent use of anti-retroviral medications. To detect HIV infection in the child, a test that can identify the genetic material of HIV is needed.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot, and rapid HIV antibody tests are all used to detect HIV antibodies in the blood, which may not be present in a newborn who has been infected. These tests are typically used for diagnosing HIV infection in adults and may not be accurate in infants.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a molecular diagnostic test that can detect the genetic material of HIV, specifically the viral RNA or DNA, in the blood. This test is highly sensitive and specific, making it an ideal choice for detecting HIV infection in newborns.

Southern blot is a laboratory technique used to detect specific DNA sequences, but it is not typically used for diagnosing HIV infection.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), PCR is the recommended test for diagnosing HIV infection in infants born to HIV-infected mothers.",Success
"A 53-year-old man presents to his physician’s office with a persistent cough which he has had over the last few months. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the previous year and since then has been on a short-acting β-agonist to help alleviate his symptoms. Since his diagnosis, he has quit smoking, a habit which he had developed about 30 years ago. He used to smoke about 2 packs of cigarettes daily. Today, he has come in with an increase in his symptoms. He tells his physician that he has been having a fever for the past 3 days, ranging between 37.8°–39°C (100°F–102.2°F). Along with this, he has a persistent cough with copious amounts of greenish-yellow sputum. He has also been having difficulty breathing. On examination, his temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), the respirations are 22/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 115/min. Slight crackles and respiratory wheezes are prominent in the lower lung fields. His FEV1 is 57% of his normal predicted value. He is started on oxygen and a dose of oral prednisone. At this time, which of the following should also be considered as a treatment option?",A,"The correct answer is B. Ciprofloxacin.

The patient's symptoms, including a persistent cough, fever, and difficulty breathing, along with the presence of greenish-yellow sputum, suggest an exacerbation of COPD, likely due to a bacterial infection. The patient's history of COPD, smoking, and recent symptoms meet the Anthonisen criteria for treating COPD exacerbations with antibiotics.

According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines, antibiotics are recommended for COPD exacerbations with increased sputum purulence, which is evident in this case. The guidelines suggest using a fluoroquinolone, such as ciprofloxacin, or a macrolide, such as erythromycin, as a first-line treatment option.

Doxycycline (Option A) is not a recommended first-line antibiotic for COPD exacerbations. Piperacillin (Option D) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that may be used for more severe infections, but it is not the best choice in this scenario. Erythromycin (Option C) is a macrolide that could be considered, but ciprofloxacin is a more appropriate choice given the patient's symptoms.

Option E, ""Antibiotics would not be appropriate at this time,"" is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and history meet the criteria for antibiotic treatment.

In summary, ciprofloxacin (Option B) is the most appropriate treatment option to consider in addition to oxygen and oral prednisone for this patient's COPD exacerbation.",Success
"An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of headaches for the past 2 weeks. His headaches tend to occur in the morning and are associated with nausea and vomiting. One month ago, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of fever, irritability, and neck rigidity, and he was successfully treated with antibiotics. His temperature today is 37.5°C (98.5°F). An MRI of the brain shows bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space. Which of the following is the most likely explanation of the patient's condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as morning headaches, nausea, and vomiting, are consistent with increased intracranial pressure. The MRI findings of bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space suggest hydrocephalus, a condition characterized by an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain.

Given the patient's recent history of meningitis (indicated by the hospital admission for fever, irritability, and neck rigidity), it is likely that the infection caused scarring and obstruction of the arachnoid granulations, which are responsible for reabsorbing CSF into the bloodstream. This obstruction would impede the normal flow of CSF, leading to its accumulation in the ventricles and subarachnoid space.

The other options are not supported by the patient's history and symptoms:

A. Increased CSF production by the choroid plexus would not be related to the patient's recent meningitis and would not explain the MRI findings.

C. Impaired CSF drainage into the subarachnoid space is not a plausible explanation, as the subarachnoid space is where CSF is produced and circulates.

D. Impaired CSF drainage into the fourth ventricle would not explain the bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space.

E. Compensatory enlargement of CSF spaces is not a recognized medical condition and does not fit the patient's symptoms and MRI findings.

Therefore, option B, impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations, is the most likely explanation for the patient's condition.",Success
"A previously healthy 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 10-day history of unsteady gait, frequent falls, and twitching of the extremities. Physical examination shows bilateral saccadic eye movement in all directions and brief, involuntary muscle contractions of the trunk and limbs. There is an ill-defined, nontender mass in the upper right abdomen. He undergoes surgical resection of the tumor. Histopathologic examination of this mass is most likely to show which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is D. Small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil.

The patient's symptoms, such as unsteady gait, frequent falls, and twitching of the extremities, suggest a neurological disorder. The presence of bilateral saccadic eye movement and brief, involuntary muscle contractions of the trunk and limbs further support this diagnosis. The ill-defined, nontender mass in the upper right abdomen is likely a tumor that is causing these symptoms.

Given the patient's age and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is a neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that originates from immature nerve cells. Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children, and it often presents with neurological symptoms.

Histopathologically, neuroblastoma is characterized by small, round, blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil, which is a network of nerve fibers. This characteristic rosette pattern is a hallmark of neuroblastoma.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and diagnosis:

A. Blastic skeletal muscle cells arranged in nests and sheets are more characteristic of a rhabdomyosarcoma, a type of soft tissue sarcoma.

B. Numerous immature lymphocytes in a starry sky pattern are more characteristic of a lymphoma, such as Burkitt lymphoma.

C. Abortive glomeruli and tubules in a spindle cell stroma are more characteristic of a Wilms tumor, a type of kidney cancer.

E. Hepatocytes in fetal and embryonic stages of differentiation are more characteristic of a hepatoblastoma, a type of liver cancer.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and histopathological features, the correct answer is D. Small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil.",Success
"In a study, 2 groups are placed on different statin medications, statin A and statin B. Baseline LDL levels are drawn for each group and are subsequently measured every 3 months for 1 year. Average baseline LDL levels for each group were identical. The group receiving statin A exhibited an 11 mg/dL greater reduction in LDL in comparison to the statin B group. Statistical analysis reports a p-value of 0.052. Which of the following best describes the meaning of this p-value?",B,"The correct answer is B. There is a 5.2% chance that A is more effective than B is due to chance.

The p-value represents the probability of observing the difference between the two groups (or a more extreme difference) assuming that there is no real difference between the two statins (i.e., the null hypothesis is true). In this case, the p-value is 0.052, which means that there is a 5.2% chance of observing the 11 mg/dL difference (or a more extreme difference) between the two groups due to chance alone, rather than a real effect of statin A being more effective than statin B.

Option A is incorrect because the p-value does not represent the number of experiments that would show similar results. Option C is also incorrect because the p-value does not represent the probability of a real difference, but rather the probability of observing the difference (or a more extreme difference) due to chance. Option D is incorrect because, in most fields, a p-value of 0.052 is considered marginally significant or borderline significant, but not statistically significant (typically, a p-value < 0.05 is required for statistical significance). Option E is also incorrect because the p-value does not imply that there is a true effect, but rather the probability of observing the difference due to chance.",Success
"A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department because she has a cord-like rash on her left calf that is red and painful to touch. She says that she has had multiple such lesions previously. Other medical history reveals that she has had 3 past spontaneous abortions at < 10 weeks of gestational age but has never been diagnosed with any diseases. She drinks socially but has never smoked or used drugs. She has never taken any medications except for over the counter analgesics and antipyretics. Physical exam shows that the cord-like lesion is tender, thick, and hardened on palpation. In addition, she has a lacy mottled violaceous rash on multiple extremities. Which of the following antibodies would most likely be found in this patient's blood?",A,"The correct answer is A. Anti-cardiolipin.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The cord-like rash on her left calf, which is red and painful to touch, is likely a thrombophlebitis, a common manifestation of APS. The lacy, mottled, violaceous rash on multiple extremities is also consistent with livedo reticularis, another common skin manifestation of APS.

The patient's history of multiple spontaneous abortions at <10 weeks of gestation is also a key feature of APS. The presence of anti-cardiolipin antibodies in her blood would support this diagnosis.

Anti-cardiolipin antibodies are a type of antiphospholipid antibody that is commonly found in patients with APS. They are directed against cardiolipin, a phospholipid found in the mitochondrial membrane of cells. The presence of these antibodies is a diagnostic criterion for APS.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings:

* Anti-centromere antibodies are associated with limited systemic sclerosis (CREST syndrome).
* Anti-helicase antibodies are not a recognized autoimmune antibody.
* Anti-histone antibodies are associated with drug-induced lupus.

Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a large, pedunculated tumor in the left atrium. This patient is most at risk for:",D,"The correct answer is D. Acute arterial occlusion.

The patient's transthoracic echocardiography reveals a large, pedunculated tumor in the left atrium, which is likely a myxoma, a type of benign cardiac tumor. The pedunculated nature of the tumor increases the risk of tumor embolization, where the tumor breaks off and travels through the bloodstream, potentially causing acute arterial occlusion.

Acute arterial occlusion can occur when the tumor embolus lodges in a peripheral artery, causing sudden and severe ischemia to the affected limb or organ. This is a serious complication that requires prompt medical attention.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:

A. Abrupt hypotension is not a typical complication of a left atrial myxoma.

B. Sudden cardiac death is a possibility in certain cardiac conditions, but it is not a direct risk associated with a left atrial myxoma.

C. Deep venous thrombosis is a risk factor for pulmonary embolism, but it is not directly related to a left atrial myxoma.

"An 8-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with respiratory distress, facial edema, and a skin rash after eating a buffet dinner with her family. She was born at 39 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery, has met all developmental milestones and is fully vaccinated. Past medical history is significant for mild allergies to pet dander and ragweed, as well as a severe peanut allergy. She also has asthma. She normally carries both an emergency inhaler and EpiPen but forgot them today. Family history is noncontributory. The vital signs include: blood pressure 112/87 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 37.2°C (99.0°F). On physical examination, the patient has severe edema over her face and an audible stridor in both lungs. Of the following options, which is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. IM epinephrine.

This patient is presenting with symptoms of anaphylaxis, a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction. The presence of respiratory distress, facial edema, and stridor (a high-pitched sound when breathing in) indicates a severe reaction. The patient's history of a severe peanut allergy and recent food exposure at the buffet dinner suggest that this reaction is likely due to an allergen exposure.

The most appropriate next step in management is to administer epinephrine via intramuscular (IM) injection. Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis, and IM injection is the recommended route of administration. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) guidelines recommend administering epinephrine via IM injection in the mid-antrolateral thigh, at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 0.5 mg.

Option B, oral diphenhydramine, is not appropriate as the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. While diphenhydramine can be used as an adjunctive treatment for anaphylaxis, it is not a substitute for epinephrine.

Option C, IV epinephrine, is not recommended as the initial treatment for anaphylaxis. IV epinephrine is typically reserved for patients who do not respond to IM epinephrine or who require ongoing treatment in a hospital setting.

Option D, extra-strength topical diphenhydramine, is not relevant to the treatment of anaphylaxis.

Option E, inhaled sodium cromolyn, is a mast cell stabilizer that is used to prevent asthma symptoms, but it is not effective in treating anaphylaxis.

In summary, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to administer epinephrine via IM injection, as it is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis.",Success
"An investigator is studying the cell morphologies of the respiratory tract. He obtains a biopsy from the mainstem bronchus of a patient. On microscopic examination, the biopsy sample shows uniform squamous cells in layers. Which of the following best describes the histologic finding seen in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Metaplasia.

Here's why:

The biopsy sample shows uniform squamous cells in layers, which is not a normal finding in the mainstem bronchus. Normally, the epithelial lining of the mainstem bronchus is composed of ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium. The presence of squamous cells in layers is a characteristic of metaplasia.

Metaplasia is a reversible change in which one type of differentiated cell is replaced by another type of differentiated cell, often in response to chronic irritation or inflammation. In this case, the normal columnar epithelium has been replaced by squamous epithelium, which is a type of epithelium typically found in the skin or esophagus.

Option B, Normal epithelium, is incorrect because the biopsy sample does not show the normal ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium expected in the mainstem bronchus.

Option C, Dysplasia, refers to a disordered growth of cells that is often a precursor to cancer. While dysplasia can occur in the respiratory tract, it is not characterized by the uniform presence of squamous cells in layers.

Option D, Hyperplasia, refers to an increase in the number of cells in a tissue, often in response to chronic irritation or inflammation. While hyperplasia can occur in the respiratory tract, it is not characterized by a change in cell type, as seen in this biopsy sample.

Option E, Anaplasia, refers to a loss of cellular differentiation and is often seen in malignant neoplasms. It is not a characteristic of the biopsy sample described.

Ultrasound reveals bilateral enlarged ovaries with multiple cysts. Which of the following is the patient most likely increased risk of developing?",B,"The correct answer is B. Endometrial carcinoma.

The patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings are consistent with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder that affects ovulation and is characterized by:

* Irregular periods
* Hyperandrogenism (excess androgen hormones), leading to acne, hirsutism (excessive hair growth on the face, chest, and back), and male pattern baldness
* Bilateral enlarged ovaries with multiple cysts on ultrasound

PCOS is associated with an increased risk of endometrial carcinoma, which is a type of cancer that develops in the lining of the uterus (endometrium). This is due to the chronic estrogen stimulation and anovulation that occur in PCOS, leading to unopposed estrogen exposure and increased cell proliferation in the endometrium.

The other options are not directly related to PCOS or the patient's symptoms:

A. Hypothyroidism is a condition characterized by an underactive thyroid gland, which is not related to PCOS.

C. Addison disease is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by adrenal insufficiency, which is not related to PCOS.

D. Wegener granulomatosus is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the blood vessels, which is not related to PCOS.

E. Eclampsia is a life-threatening condition that occurs in pregnancy, characterized by seizures and hypertension, which is not related to PCOS.

Which of the following characteristics of the lesion would likely be found on physical examination?",A,"The correct answer is A. Brown-black color in one area of the lesion to red-white in a different area.

The patient's presentation and dermatopathology results suggest a diagnosis of melanoma, a type of skin cancer that arises from melanocytes. One of the characteristic features of melanoma is the ABCDE rule, which stands for:

A - Asymmetry: The lesion is not symmetrical, with one half not matching the other half.

B - Border: The borders of the lesion are irregular, notched, or scalloped.

C - Color: The lesion has multiple colors, such as brown, black, red, white, or blue. In this case, the correct answer option A describes a lesion with brown-black color in one area and red-white in a different area.

D - Diameter: The lesion is larger in diameter than 6mm (although melanomas can be smaller).

E - Evolving: The lesion is changing in size, shape, or color over time.

The other options are not characteristic of melanoma:

B. A macule that is 5mm in diameter is a small, flat lesion, but melanoma can be larger and have an irregular shape.

C. A well-circumscribed papule with smooth borders is more typical of a benign lesion, such as a nevus.

D. Itching and pain to palpation can be associated with melanoma, but they are not specific characteristics of the lesion itself.

A CT scan of the head shows an unchanged right-sided subdural hematoma. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",D,"The correct answer is D. Fluid restriction.

The patient's laboratory results indicate hyponatremia (sodium level of 130 mEq/L), which is a common complication of subdural hematoma. The patient's urine sodium level is 45 mEq/L, and urine osmolality is 326 mOsmol/kg H2O, suggesting that the kidneys are retaining sodium and water, leading to dilutional hyponatremia.

The most appropriate next step in management is fluid restriction to reduce the amount of free water in the body and help correct the hyponatremia. This is a recommended treatment approach for hyponatremia in patients with subdural hematoma, as it can help reduce cerebral edema and improve outcomes.

Option A, head elevation, is not a specific treatment for hyponatremia. Option B, tolvaptan, is a vasopressin receptor antagonist that can be used to treat hyponatremia, but it is not the first-line treatment in this scenario. Option C, desmopressin, is a medication that can exacerbate hyponatremia and is not indicated in this case. Option E, mannitol, is an osmotic diuretic that can be used to reduce cerebral edema, but it is not a treatment for hyponatremia.

It's worth noting that the patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and the physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities, which suggests that the patient is not experiencing severe symptoms related to the hyponatremia. However, fluid restriction is still the most appropriate next step in management to prevent further complications.",Success

A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital for treatment of unstable angina. Cardiac catheterization shows occlusion that has caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery. Resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased by what factor relative to a vessel with no occlusion?,B,"The correct answer is B. 16.

Here's the explanation:

The resistance to blood flow in a vessel is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the vessel, as described by Poiseuille's law. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

Resistance ∝ 1/r^4

When the diameter of the vessel is reduced by 50%, the radius is reduced by 29.3% (since diameter is twice the radius). Let's assume the original radius of the vessel is 1 unit. After the 50% reduction in diameter, the new radius would be:

New radius = 1 - 0.293 = 0.707 units

Now, we can calculate the new resistance:

New resistance ∝ 1/(0.707)^4 = 1/0.25 = 4^2 = 16

So, the resistance to blood flow in the partially occluded vessel has increased by a factor of 16 relative to a vessel with no occlusion.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. 16.",Success

When the child stands on his right leg, his left leg drops and his pelvis tilts towards the left. Sensation to light touch is normal in both legs. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to the injection of the vaccine into which of the following locations?",D,"The correct answer is A. Inferolateral quadrant of the right buttock.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, specifically the dropping of the left leg and tilting of the pelvis towards the left when standing on the right leg, suggest a lesion or injury to the right superior gluteal nerve. This nerve is responsible for innervating the gluteus medius muscle, which is essential for hip abduction and stabilization.

The superior gluteal nerve is located in the inferolateral quadrant of the buttock. If a vaccine is injected into this area, it can cause inflammation or injury to the nerve, leading to the observed symptoms.

The other options are incorrect because:

* B. Inferomedial quadrant of the right buttock: This area is closer to the sciatic nerve, which would cause symptoms in the lower leg, not the hip or pelvis.
* C. Inferomedial quadrant of the left buttock: This would affect the left superior gluteal nerve, causing symptoms on the left side, not the right.
* D. Superomedial quadrant of the right buttock: This area is not in close proximity to the superior gluteal nerve.
* E. Inferolateral quadrant of the left buttock: This would affect the left superior gluteal nerve, causing symptoms on the left side, not the right.

It's essential to note that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend injecting vaccines into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm or the anterolateral aspect of the thigh, depending on the vaccine and the patient's age.

The patient's symptoms and CT scan results are consistent with Wilms' tumor, a type of pediatric kidney cancer. The histological examination showing primitive blastemal cells and immature tubules and glomeruli further supports this diagnosis.

Wilms' tumor arises from the metanephric blastema, which is the embryological precursor of the kidney. The adrenal gland, specifically the adrenal medulla, also develops from the same embryological structure, the neural crest. During embryonic development, the neural crest gives rise to the adrenal medulla, as well as other structures such as the sympathetic nervous system.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Carotid body: Develops from the neural crest, but is not related to the embryological structure of the kidney.

C. Thyroid gland: Develops from the floor of the pharynx and is not related to the embryological structure of the kidney.

D. Papillary muscles: Develop from the myocardium of the heart and are not related to the embryological structure of the kidney.

E. Anterior pituitary: Develops from Rathke's pouch, an outpocketing of the oral ectoderm, and is not related to the embryological structure of the kidney.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Adrenal medulla, as it shares a common embryological origin with the kidney.",Success
"A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an increasing difficulty in hearing over the past several months. His mother says they have to speak at a higher volume for him to understand them. He also complains of having difficulty reading his favorite books because he is not able to see the words clearly. His father received a renal transplant in his 20s. The vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Serum
Urea nitrogen 15 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL
Urine
Blood 1+
Protein 1+
RBC 15–17/hpf
WBC 1–2/hpf
The audiometry shows bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. The ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus. Which of the following best explains these findings?",A,"The correct answer is A. Alport syndrome.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results point to a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, ears, and eyes. The key findings are:

1. Bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, indicating a problem with the inner ear or auditory nerve.
2. Anterior lenticonus, a characteristic abnormality of the lens in the eye.
3. Hematuria (blood in the urine) and proteinuria (excess protein in the urine), suggesting kidney damage.
4. A family history of kidney disease, as the patient's father received a renal transplant in his 20s.

Alport syndrome is a rare X-linked genetic disorder that affects the glomeruli, the filtering units of the kidneys, leading to progressive kidney disease. It is also associated with sensorineural hearing loss and eye abnormalities, including anterior lenticonus. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 genes, which code for type IV collagen.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and laboratory results as well:

B. Fabry's disease is a lysosomal storage disorder that can cause kidney damage, but it is not typically associated with sensorineural hearing loss or anterior lenticonus.

C. Fanconi syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the proximal tubules of the kidneys, leading to excessive urinary excretion of amino acids, glucose, and other substances. While it can cause kidney damage, it is not typically associated with hearing loss or eye abnormalities.

D. Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a genetic disorder that affects the development of tumors in various organs, including the kidneys. While it can cause kidney damage, it is not typically associated with sensorineural hearing loss or anterior lenticonus.

E. Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder that causes benign tumors to grow in various organs, including the kidneys. While it can cause kidney damage, it is not typically associated with sensorineural hearing loss or anterior lenticonus.

In summary, the combination of bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, anterior lenticonus, and kidney damage, along with a family history of kidney disease, points to Alport syndrome as the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 16-year-old female presents to her primary care physician due to lack of menstruation. She has never had a period and is anxious that she is not “keeping up” with her friends. She states that her breasts began developing when she was 13, and she had a growth spurt around the same time. Review of systems reveals that she has also been getting headaches every few months over the last year with some photosensitivity and nausea each time. Ibuprofen relieves her symptoms. The patient is a competitive ice skater and has never been sexually active. Her mother has a history of migraine headaches, and her older sister has a history of bipolar disorder. Both underwent menarche at age 15. At this visit, the patient’s temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 118/65 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Her body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Both breasts are Tanner IV with no expressable discharge. Pelvic and axillary hair growth is also Tanner IV. The patient is unable to tolerate a full pelvic exam, but the part of the vaginal canal that is examined is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are ordered and are below:

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
K+: 4.1 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL
Glucose: 73 mg/dL

AST: 11 U/L
ALT: 11 U/L
Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH): 16.2 mIU/mL (4.7-21.5 mIU/ml)
Estrogen: 240 pg/mL (64-357 pg/mL)

Abdominal ultrasound is performed and shows a normal uterus and ovaries. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is E. Normal development.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest that she is experiencing a normal delay in menarche. The following points support this diagnosis:

1. **Breast development**: The patient's breasts are Tanner IV, indicating normal breast development, which typically precedes menarche.
2. **FSH and estrogen levels**: The FSH level is within the normal range, and the estrogen level is slightly elevated, indicating that the patient's hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is functioning normally.
3. **Normal abdominal ultrasound**: The ultrasound shows a normal uterus and ovaries, ruling out any anatomical abnormalities that could be causing the lack of menstruation.
4. **Family history**: The patient's mother and sister both had menarche at age 15, which is within the normal range. This suggests that there may be a familial tendency towards slightly later menarche.
5. **Lack of other symptoms**: The patient does not have any other symptoms that would suggest an underlying hormonal or anatomical abnormality, such as hirsutism, acne, or galactorrhea.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

A. **Hypothalamic amenorrhea**: This is unlikely, as the patient's FSH and estrogen levels are normal, and she is not experiencing significant weight loss or stress that could be causing amenorrhea.

B. **Hyperprolactinemia**: This is unlikely, as the patient does not have galactorrhea or other symptoms of hyperprolactinemia, and her estrogen level is normal.

C. **Imperforate hymen**: This is unlikely, as the patient's vaginal exam was unremarkable, and an imperforate hymen would typically cause symptoms such as pelvic pain or abdominal pain.

D. **Vaginal septum**: This is unlikely, as the patient's vaginal exam was unremarkable, and a vaginal septum would typically cause symptoms such as dyspareunia or difficulty with tampon use.

In conclusion, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a normal delay in menarche, and the most likely diagnosis is E. Normal development.",Success
"A 35-year-old man presents to the emergency room due to shortness of breath that started an hour ago while playing football with some friends. He has had similar episodes in the past when he also had to be rushed to the hospital. Physical examination shows body temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse rate is 100/min, respiratory rate is 28/min and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Also, it shows decreased breath sounds on both sides, the peak expiratory flow rate is 200 L/min and SpO2 is 89% on room air. The man is given an initial treatment with nebulization using an inhaled short-acting β-agonist. An arterial blood gas analysis shows the following:
pH 7.48
PaO2 59 mm Hg
PaCO2 26 mm Hg
HCO3- 26 mEq/L
After administering oxygen by mask, the man’s PaO2 increases to 75 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Asthma attack.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath, decreased breath sounds on both sides, and low peak expiratory flow rate, are consistent with an asthma attack. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.48, which is slightly alkalotic, indicating respiratory alkalosis. This is consistent with asthma, as patients with asthma often hyperventilate, leading to respiratory alkalosis. The PaO2 of 59 mm Hg and PaCO2 of 26 mm Hg also support this diagnosis.

The patient's response to oxygen therapy, with an increase in PaO2 to 75 mm Hg, further supports the diagnosis of asthma. Asthma patients often respond well to bronchodilators and oxygen therapy.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

B. Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning: The patient's symptoms and blood gas analysis are not consistent with CO poisoning, which typically presents with a normal or slightly elevated PaO2 and a normal pH.

C. Atelectasis: Atelectasis would not cause the patient's symptoms, and the blood gas analysis does not support this diagnosis.

D. Neuromuscular disease: Neuromuscular diseases, such as myasthenia gravis, would not cause the patient's symptoms, and the blood gas analysis does not support this diagnosis.

E. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): ARDS typically presents with a more severe clinical picture, including hypoxemia that is refractory to oxygen therapy. The patient's response to oxygen therapy and the blood gas analysis do not support this diagnosis.

In conclusion, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and blood gas analysis, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is an asthma attack.",Success
"A 48-year-old homeless male is brought to the emergency department, by the police, for altered mental status. Past medical records are unavailable. A physical exam on admission reveals scleral icterus and a flapping tremor of the wrists during extension. The patient is admitted to the hospital and his treatment is started after appropriate investigation. The next morning on rounds, he complains of eleven episodes of diarrhea and near-constant flatulence overnight. His mental status has improved and his hand tremor has resolved. Which of the following medications did this patient most likely receive after admission?",B,"The correct answer is B. Lactulose.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation with scleral icterus and a flapping tremor of the wrists during extension suggests a diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver disease. The patient's improvement in mental status and resolution of hand tremor overnight suggest that treatment was initiated.

The patient's complaint of diarrhea and flatulence is a common side effect of lactulose, a medication used to treat hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose is a non-absorbable disaccharide that helps to reduce the production of ammonia in the gut, which is a toxin that can contribute to hepatic encephalopathy. The diarrhea and flatulence are a result of the medication's effect on the gut microbiome.

Thiamine (A) is a vitamin that is often given to patients with altered mental status, especially those with a history of alcohol abuse, but it is not typically associated with diarrhea and flatulence.

Naloxone (C) is an opioid antagonist that is used to treat opioid overdose, but it is not related to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.

Loperamide (D) is an anti-diarrheal medication, but it would not cause diarrhea and flatulence.

Rifaximin (E) is an antibiotic that is sometimes used to treat hepatic encephalopathy, but it is not typically associated with diarrhea and flatulence as a side effect.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and diagnosis, lactulose (B) is the most likely medication that was administered.",Success
"A 61-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of abdominal pain and constipation. He reports a 4-day history of steady right lower quadrant pain. He has had one small bowel movement in 4 days. Normally he has a bowel movement once a day. His medical history is notable for poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, and atorvastatin. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history and drinks 3-4 beers per day. His diet consists primarily of fast food. His temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 16/min. A review of the patient’s medical record reveals colonoscopy results from 1 year ago. Relevant findings included multiple small, pedunculated polyps which were removed, multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings, and no other masses. This patient’s condition is most strongly associated with which of the following disorders?",C,"The correct answer is C. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and constipation, along with the presence of multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings (diverticula) found on colonoscopy, suggest a diagnosis of diverticulitis. Diverticulitis is a complication of diverticulosis, which is a condition characterized by the presence of multiple small pouches or sacs in the wall of the colon.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of genetic disorders that affect the body's connective tissue, which provides support to various organs, joints, and other structures. One of the features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is gastrointestinal manifestations, including diverticulosis and diverticulitis. The syndrome is also associated with other symptoms such as skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and tissue fragility.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and condition:

A. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and liver, leading to emphysema and liver disease.

B. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disorder is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, leading to cyst formation and kidney failure.

D. Goodpasture syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the kidneys and lungs, leading to glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage.

E. Menetrier disease is a rare disorder characterized by excessive growth of the mucous cells in the stomach, leading to protein loss and gastrointestinal symptoms.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of smoking and poor diet may have contributed to his development of diverticulitis, but they are not directly related to the underlying condition associated with diverticulosis.",Success
"A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with sudden onset of slurred speech. The patient’s eldest daughter says that he couldn’t move his arm during the episode. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and a hemorrhagic stroke 6 years ago, which was treated surgically. After admission, the patient gets increasingly worse and loses consciousness. A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain. The patient’s daughter is asked to consent to a non-emergent, life-saving operation since the patient is in a comatose state. She does not consent to the operation even though the physician stresses it would be life-saving. Upon further discussion, the physician finds out that the patient was abusive and neglectful to his children, and the daughter wants “to live in peace.” The patient has no written advanced directive. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?",C,"The correct answer is A. Follow the daughter's wishes to withhold the operation.

In this scenario, the patient is in a comatose state and has no written advanced directive. The daughter, as the patient's surrogate decision-maker, has the authority to make medical decisions on behalf of her father. Although the physician believes the operation is life-saving, the daughter has the right to refuse consent based on her father's best interests, as she perceives them.

The American Medical Association's (AMA) Code of Medical Ethics states that ""physicians should respect the decision-making capacity of patients or their surrogates"" (AMA, 2020). In the absence of a written advanced directive, the surrogate's decision should be respected, even if it goes against the physician's medical judgment.

Referring the case to the court (Option B) may be considered if there is a dispute among family members or if the surrogate's decision is clearly not in the patient's best interests. However, in this scenario, the daughter's decision, although motivated by personal reasons, is not necessarily contrary to her father's best interests.

Contacting another family member for consent (Option C) is not appropriate, as the daughter has already been established as the surrogate decision-maker.

Performing the surgery without consent (Option D) is unethical and illegal. It would violate the patient's autonomy and the daughter's right to make decisions on his behalf.

Reporting the daughter to the police (Option E) is not relevant to the situation, as there is no indication of abuse or neglect towards the patient.

In summary, the most appropriate course of action is to follow the daughter's wishes to withhold the operation, respecting her decision as the patient's surrogate decision-maker.",Success
A 50-year-old man with congestive heart failure (CHF) was started on an experimental analog of atrial natriuretic peptide. Which of the following would he expect to experience?,C,"The correct answer is C. Increased glomerular filtration rate, restricted aldosterone release, vascular smooth muscle dilation.

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a hormone produced by the heart in response to increased blood volume and pressure. It plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure, fluid balance, and electrolyte homeostasis. The experimental analog of ANP would likely have similar effects.

Here's why option C is the correct answer:

* Increased glomerular filtration rate: ANP increases glomerular filtration rate by dilating afferent arterioles and constricting efferent arterioles, leading to increased urine production and sodium excretion.
* Restricted aldosterone release: ANP inhibits the release of aldosterone, a hormone that promotes sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the kidneys. By reducing aldosterone release, ANP decreases sodium reabsorption and increases potassium excretion.
* Vascular smooth muscle dilation: ANP is a potent vasodilator, causing relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and decreasing peripheral resistance, which helps to lower blood pressure.

The other options are incorrect because:

* A. ANP decreases water reabsorption by the renal collecting ducts, not increases it.
* B. ANP has opposite effects to those listed, including vasodilation, decreased blood pressure, and inhibited aldosterone release.
* D. ANP decreases renal absorption of sodium and water, not increases it.
* E. ANP does not directly affect plasma calcium levels or renal reabsorption of phosphate.

It's essential to note that the effects of ANP may vary depending on the specific experimental analog and the individual patient's response. However, based on the known physiological effects of ANP, option C is the most likely correct answer.",Success
"A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency room after a motor vehicle accident. The patient’s vitals are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min, respiratory rate 39/min, and temperature 37.1°C (98.8℉). On physical examination, the patient is unconscious with a GCS of 9/15 and is cyanotic. There are open fractures of the left femur and left tibia, a likely shoulder dislocation, multiple contusions on the limbs and thorax, and a puncture wound on the left side of his chest. There are no breath sounds on the left side and there is hyperresonance to percussion on the left. Preparations are made for an emergency needle thoracostomy to be performed to treat this patient’s likely tension pneumothorax. Which one of the following is the best choice to provide informed consent for this procedure?",D,"The correct answer is D. Informed consent is not needed in this case.

In this scenario, the patient is unconscious and critically ill, requiring immediate medical attention. The patient's condition is life-threatening, and the emergency needle thoracostomy is a necessary intervention to treat the likely tension pneumothorax.

Informed consent is typically obtained from the patient or their legally authorized representative before performing a medical procedure. However, in emergency situations where the patient is unable to provide consent and there is no time to locate a surrogate decision-maker, the principle of implied consent applies.

Implied consent assumes that the patient would consent to the necessary treatment if they were able to do so. In this case, the patient's critical condition and the need for immediate intervention to prevent further harm or death justify proceeding with the procedure without obtaining formal informed consent.

The other options are not correct because:

A. While the patient's closest relatives may be involved in decision-making, they are not present at the hospital, and delaying the procedure to obtain their consent would put the patient's life at risk.

B. A witness at the scene of the car accident has no legal authority to provide informed consent for the patient.

C. The hospital ethics committee is not responsible for providing informed consent for individual patients.

E. The hospital lawyer and ethics committee are not involved in providing informed consent or making medical decisions for the patient.",Success
A group of researchers wants to evaluate how often the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is related to high-risk behaviors in female sex workers from their country. An additional aim is to evaluate the association between HIV acquisition and certain sociodemographic factors. The researchers collect data through interviewer-administered questionnaires (for behavioral and sociodemographic data) as well as through clinical and serological evaluation/screening methods for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Which of the following could be the main outcome measure of their study?,B,"The correct answer is B. Prevalence.

Here's why:

The researchers are collecting data on the presence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in female sex workers through clinical and serological evaluation/screening methods. They are also collecting data on high-risk behaviors and sociodemographic factors through interviewer-administered questionnaires. The main outcome measure of their study is likely to be the prevalence of HIV among female sex workers, which is the proportion of individuals in the study population who have HIV at a particular point in time.

Prevalence is a measure of the total number of cases of a disease or condition in a population at a specific point in time, whereas incidence refers to the number of new cases that occur over a specific period. Since the researchers are collecting data on the presence of HIV and STIs at a single point in time, prevalence is a more suitable outcome measure.

Hazard rate (option C) is a measure of the rate at which new cases of a disease occur over time, and is typically used in survival analysis. Relative risk (option D) and attributable risk (option E) are measures of association between a risk factor and a disease outcome, and are not directly applicable to this study design.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Prevalence.",Success
A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of multiple episodes of small amounts of blood in his stools. Examination shows pale conjunctivae. His hemoglobin concentration is 8.3 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume is 72μm3. Colonoscopy shows a 2.3-cm polypoid mass in the ascending colon. A photomicrograph of a biopsy specimen of the lesion is shown. Which of the following processes is most likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?,D,"The correct answer is D. Impaired degradation of β-catenin.

The photomicrograph of the biopsy specimen is not provided, but based on the clinical presentation and the options, it is likely that the lesion is a colorectal adenocarcinoma. β-catenin is a key protein involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. In colorectal cancer, the Wnt pathway is often activated due to mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene or β-catenin itself, leading to impaired degradation of β-catenin. This results in the accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus, where it activates transcription factors that promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.

The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer:

A. Underexpression of COX-2 is not a characteristic feature of colorectal cancer. COX-2 is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis and is often overexpressed in colorectal cancer, promoting tumorigenesis.

B. Increased activity of c-KIT is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) rather than colorectal cancer.

C. Increased phosphorylation of serine and threonine is a general mechanism of cellular signaling and is not specific to colorectal cancer.

E. Abnormal transfer of phosphate to cellular proteins is not a well-established mechanism in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.

Therefore, impaired degradation of β-catenin is the most likely process involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition.",Success
"A 68-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with a 7-month history of fatigue and low back pain. Her pain is not improved by over the counter analgesics. Laboratory analysis is notable for a calcium level of 11.5 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen level of 30 mg/dL. Large eosinophilic casts are seen on renal biopsy. Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen on peripheral blood smear?",B,"The correct answer is D. Leukocytosis with abundant mature myeloid cells.

The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and renal biopsy findings are consistent with multiple myeloma, a type of cancer that affects the plasma cells in the bone marrow. The presence of large eosinophilic casts on renal biopsy, also known as ""cast nephropathy,"" is a characteristic feature of multiple myeloma.

On peripheral blood smear, multiple myeloma is often associated with leukocytosis, which is an increase in the total white blood cell count. Specifically, there is an increase in mature myeloid cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes, due to the proliferation of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow.

The other options are not directly related to multiple myeloma:

A. Abundant reticulocytes would be seen in conditions such as hemolytic anemia or bleeding, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

B. Linear aggregations of red blood cells are seen in conditions such as rouleaux formation, which is not specific to multiple myeloma.

C. Schistocytes are fragmented red blood cells seen in conditions such as thrombotic microangiopathies, which is not related to multiple myeloma.

E. Smudge cells are a feature of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which is a different type of cancer.

"A 95-year-old woman who is a resident at a long term care facility, got up from her chair, tripped on a rug, and fell on her right knee. She could not get up without assistance and complained of severe pain in her right hip and buttock. The nurse who evaluated her tried to stand her up, but when the patient tried to stand on her right leg, she dropped her left hip and lost her balance. The nurse then recognized that her patient had a foreshortened right leg fixed in the adducted position and a large swelling in her right buttock. At the receiving hospital, the patient was confused and, though she knew her name, she couldn’t remember the date and insists to leave the hospital immediately to see her family. Past medical history includes diabetes, congestive heart failure, and incontinence. She is currently taking metformin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and oxybutynin. Physical exam confirmed the nurse’s findings. Radiographs proved the presence of a right posterior hip dislocation without fractures. What medication is most likely associated with this patient’s confusion?",B,"The correct answer is B. Oxybutynin.

Oxybutynin, an anticholinergic medication, is commonly used to treat urinary incontinence. It can cause anticholinergic side effects, including confusion, especially in elderly patients. The patient's symptoms of confusion, disorientation, and agitation are consistent with anticholinergic toxicity.

The other options are less likely to be associated with the patient's confusion:

A. Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic medication used to treat diabetes, and it is not typically associated with confusion.

C. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker used to treat hypertension and heart failure. While it can cause dizziness and lightheadedness, it is not typically associated with confusion.

D. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor used to treat hypertension and heart failure. It is not typically associated with confusion.

E. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic used to treat hypertension and heart failure. While it can cause electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to confusion, this is less likely in this patient given the presence of other medications with anticholinergic properties.

It's essential to consider the patient's medication list and medical history when evaluating her symptoms. In this case, oxybutynin is the most likely culprit contributing to the patient's confusion.",Success
"A 26-year-old woman comes to the clinic for an annual wellness examination. She is healthy with no prior history of significant illness. She exercises 3-4 times a week and eats a plant-based diet with no carbonated drinks. When asked if anything is bothering her, she reports that she has been having recurring episodes of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes for the past year. She denies any fever, sick contacts, cough, headaches, chest pain, urinary symptoms, or constipation/diarrhea during these episodes. She is told to take a medication to alleviate her symptoms as needed. What is the likely mechanism of action of the medication in question?",A,"The correct answer is C. Disruption of disulfide bonds.

Based on the patient's symptoms of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes, it is likely that she has allergic rhinitis. The medication prescribed to alleviate her symptoms as needed is likely an antihistamine, which works by disrupting the disulfide bonds of histamine, a chemical released by the body's immune system during an allergic reaction. This disruption prevents histamine from binding to its receptors, thereby reducing the symptoms of allergic rhinitis.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Alpha-adrenergic agonist: This mechanism of action is associated with medications that constrict blood vessels, increase blood pressure, and dilate pupils. While alpha-adrenergic agonists may have some effects on the nasal passages, they are not typically used to treat allergic rhinitis.

B. Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors: This mechanism of action is associated with anticholinergic medications, which are used to treat conditions such as overactive bladder, asthma, and COPD. They are not typically used to treat allergic rhinitis.

D. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5: This mechanism of action is associated with medications used to treat erectile dysfunction, such as sildenafil (Viagra). It is not related to the treatment of allergic rhinitis.

E. Short-acting beta-2 agonist: This mechanism of action is associated with medications used to treat asthma and COPD, such as albuterol. While beta-2 agonists may have some effects on the nasal passages, they are not typically used to treat allergic rhinitis.

It's worth noting that the patient's symptoms and medical history are consistent with allergic rhinitis, and an antihistamine is a common medication used to treat this condition.",Success
"A 27-year-old woman was referred to a dermatology clinic due to a changing discoloration of her fingers from white to red to blue. Although she has not had any recent changes in her daily routines, she also complains of increasing fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight loss. She has a blood pressure of 126/77 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 14/min, and heart rate of 88/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. Anti-U1 RNP antibodies and increased creatinine kinase were found in her serum. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Mixed connective tissue disease.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, particularly the changing discoloration of her fingers from white to red to blue, suggest Raynaud's phenomenon, which is a common feature of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). The presence of anti-U1 RNP antibodies in her serum further supports this diagnosis, as they are a hallmark of MCTD.

The patient's complaints of increasing fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight loss are also consistent with MCTD, which can cause myositis (muscle inflammation) and other systemic symptoms. The elevated creatinine kinase level in her serum suggests muscle damage, which is also consistent with myositis.

While the other options are all autoimmune disorders that can cause similar symptoms, they are less likely given the patient's specific presentation and laboratory results:

* Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is possible, but the presence of anti-U1 RNP antibodies is more specific to MCTD. SLE would also be more likely to present with other symptoms such as joint pain, skin rashes, and kidney involvement.
* Polymyositis is a possibility, but it would not typically cause Raynaud's phenomenon or the specific antibody profile seen in this patient.
* Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) can cause Raynaud's phenomenon, but it would typically present with more prominent skin thickening and tightening, as well as other systemic symptoms such as gastrointestinal involvement.
* Rheumatoid arthritis is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, which do not suggest joint inflammation or erosion.

In summary, the combination of Raynaud's phenomenon, anti-U1 RNP antibodies, and elevated creatinine kinase levels makes mixed connective tissue disease the most likely diagnosis in this patient.",Success
"A 32-year-old woman presents to the physician because she feels depressed, has difficulty sleeping, has a poor appetite, and has had a problem concentrating for the past 3 months. During this time, she has also has had low energy and has lost interest in playing the guitar. During high school, the patient went through similar episodes of low mood and poor sleep. At that time, she would repeatedly engage in binge eating and purging behavior, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Her physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should be avoided in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Bupropion.

The patient has a history of binge eating and purging behavior, which suggests a possible diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. Bupropion is contraindicated in patients with a history of eating disorders, particularly bulimia nervosa, as it can increase the risk of seizures. This is stated in the FDA-approved labeling for bupropion.

The other options are not contraindicated in this patient:

B. Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is commonly used to treat depression and is not contraindicated in patients with a history of eating disorders.

C. Fluoxetine is another SSRI that is often used to treat depression, bulimia nervosa, and other eating disorders. In fact, it is FDA-approved for the treatment of bulimia nervosa.

D. Mirtazapine is a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant that can be used to treat depression and is not contraindicated in patients with a history of eating disorders.

E. Trazodone is a sedating antidepressant that can be used to treat depression and insomnia. While it may not be a first-line treatment for depression, it is not contraindicated in patients with a history of eating disorders.

It's essential to consider the patient's medical history, including their history of eating disorders, when selecting a medication for depression. In this case, bupropion should be avoided due to the increased risk of seizures in patients with a history of bulimia nervosa.",Success
"A 52-year-old man comes to the physician for an annual physical examination. He reports that his vision has progressively improved over the past 6 months and he no longer needs the glasses he used while driving. He has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include glyburide, hydrochlorothiazide, and enalapril. Examination shows 20/20 vision bilaterally. Fundoscopy shows a few microaneurysms of retinal vessels. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's improved vision?",B,"The correct answer is E. Increased lens elasticity.

The patient's improved vision is likely due to the improvement in his diabetic control, which has led to a decrease in the blood sugar levels. High blood sugar levels can cause the lens in the eye to become less elastic and more rigid, leading to presbyopia-like symptoms. As the blood sugar levels decrease, the lens becomes more elastic, allowing it to focus better and resulting in improved vision.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's improved vision:

A. Decreased susceptibility to glare: This is not a plausible explanation for the patient's improved vision, as glare is not directly related to the patient's diabetic control or medication.

B. Denaturation of lens protein: This is not a known effect of diabetic control or the patient's medications.

C. Liquefication of the vitreous body: This is a age-related change that occurs in the vitreous humor, but it is not related to the patient's improved vision.

D. Increased ciliary muscle tone: This is not a plausible explanation for the patient's improved vision, as the ciliary muscle is responsible for accommodating near vision, and the patient's improved vision is not specific to near vision.

It's worth noting that the patient's medications, including glyburide, hydrochlorothiazide, and enalapril, are not known to affect vision or lens elasticity. The improvement in vision is likely due to the improvement in diabetic control, which has led to a decrease in blood sugar levels and an increase in lens elasticity.",Success
A 21-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with right arm pain and limited range of motion. She does not recall trauma to the arm. She also complains of diarrhea and nausea. She is sexually active with one male partner and admits to having pain during intercourse. There is vague and diffuse tenderness to palpation in all four abdominal quadrants. No erythema or edema is noted on the right arm. The fecal occult test is negative. Past records show that this patient has been in the ER 7 times in the past year with similar symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,C,"The correct answer is C. Somatization disorder.

Here's why:

The patient presents with a range of symptoms, including right arm pain, limited range of motion, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal tenderness, without any clear underlying medical cause. The lack of trauma to the arm and the absence of erythema or edema suggest that the arm pain is not related to an acute injury. The patient's history of frequent ER visits (7 times in the past year) with similar symptoms raises suspicions about the possibility of a psychological disorder.

Somatization disorder is a psychological disorder characterized by recurring and multiple physical complaints, often involving different organ systems, without a clear medical explanation. The symptoms are not intentionally produced or feigned, but rather, they are a manifestation of psychological distress or conflict. The patient's symptoms, including arm pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and abdominal tenderness, are consistent with this diagnosis.

Illness anxiety disorder (option B) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's diverse range of symptoms and the lack of a clear medical diagnosis. Somatoform pain disorder (option D) is also a possibility, but it is a more specific diagnosis that focuses on pain symptoms, whereas somatization disorder encompasses a broader range of physical complaints.

Conversion disorder (option E) is a type of somatoform disorder that involves the sudden onset of neurological symptoms, such as paralysis or seizures, without a clear medical explanation. While the patient's arm pain and limited range of motion could be related to a conversion disorder, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and abdominal tenderness makes somatization disorder a more likely diagnosis.

Ulcerative colitis (option A) is a gastrointestinal disorder that can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea, but it is unlikely to cause arm pain and limited range of motion, making it an unlikely diagnosis in this case.",Success
"A 22-year-old man presents to a psychiatrist complaining of mood fluctuations. He is accompanied by his mother who reports that the patient recently experienced a 5-day episode of minimal sleep and unusual levels of energy. The patient admits to spending $2,000 of his parent’s money, without asking, on a down payment for a motorcycle. The episode resolved after 5 days, at which point the patient felt guilty and upset. The patient’s medical history is notable for multiple month-long episodes in the past 2 years of feeling sad, sleeping more than usual, being uninterested in his hobbies, and feeling constantly tired and guilty. The patient has a history of severe meningoencephalitis at the age of 17 requiring four days in the intensive care unit. During that episode, he reported seeing monkeys in his hospital room. On exam, he is a well-appearing, cooperative male in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented with a normal affect. He states that he feels sad and guilty about what happens. He denies suicidal ideation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Bipolar II disorder.

Here's why:

The patient presents with a history of mood fluctuations, including a recent 5-day episode of minimal sleep and increased energy, during which he engaged in impulsive behavior (spending $2,000 without permission). This episode is consistent with a hypomanic episode, which is a key feature of bipolar II disorder.

Additionally, the patient has a history of multiple month-long episodes of depression, characterized by feelings of sadness, increased sleep, loss of interest in activities, fatigue, and guilt. These symptoms are consistent with major depressive episodes, which are also a feature of bipolar II disorder.

The patient's history of meningoencephalitis at age 17, which included psychotic symptoms (seeing monkeys in his hospital room), is an important consideration. However, the patient's current symptoms and presentation are more consistent with a mood disorder than a psychotic disorder.

Here's why the other options are not the most likely diagnosis:

A. Bipolar I disorder: The patient's hypomanic episode lasted only 5 days, which is shorter than the 7-day duration required for a manic episode in bipolar I disorder.

C. Cyclothymic disorder: While the patient has a history of mood fluctuations, his symptoms are more severe and frequent than those typically seen in cyclothymic disorder.

D. Persistent depressive disorder: The patient's history of depression is significant, but the presence of a hypomanic episode suggests a bipolar disorder rather than a unipolar depressive disorder.

E. Schizoaffective disorder: The patient's psychotic symptoms during the meningoencephalitis episode are not currently present, and his symptoms are more consistent with a mood disorder than a psychotic disorder.

Overall, the patient's symptoms and history are most consistent with bipolar II disorder, which is characterized by recurrent major depressive episodes and at least one hypomanic episode.",Success
"A 32-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because a 5-week history of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea that has worsened in the past 24 hours. She was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 1 year ago but has had difficulty complying with her drug regimen. Her temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 92/56 mm Hg. Examination shows a distended, rigid abdomen and hypoactive bowel sounds. Fluid resuscitation is initiated. In addition to complete bowel rest, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Abdominal x-ray.

The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and a distended, rigid abdomen, suggest a severe flare of ulcerative colitis, possibly with complications such as toxic megacolon or perforation. The patient's vital signs, including fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, indicate a potentially life-threatening situation.

In this scenario, the most appropriate next step is to perform an abdominal x-ray to quickly assess for signs of bowel obstruction, perforation, or free air, which would indicate a surgical emergency. An abdominal x-ray is a rapid, non-invasive, and widely available imaging modality that can provide valuable information about the patient's condition.

The other options are not as appropriate in this situation:

A. Double-contrast barium enema is a diagnostic test that may be useful in evaluating the extent of ulcerative colitis, but it is not the most urgent or appropriate test in this emergency situation.

B. Abdominal CT scan with contrast may be useful in evaluating the patient's condition, but it is not as rapid as an abdominal x-ray, and the patient's unstable vital signs suggest that a more immediate assessment is necessary.

C. CT angiography is not indicated in this scenario, as it is typically used to evaluate vascular structures, which are not the primary concern in this patient's presentation.

E. Colonoscopy is a diagnostic test that may be useful in evaluating the extent of ulcerative colitis, but it is not appropriate in this emergency situation, as it may exacerbate the patient's condition and is not a rapid enough test to inform immediate management decisions.

In summary, an abdominal x-ray is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient, as it can quickly provide valuable information about the patient's condition and help guide further management decisions.",Success
"A 55-year-old man recovering from knee replacement surgery complains of breathlessness in the postoperative ward. He has been confined to bed for the past 5 days and is under observation. He felt a sudden difficulty in breathing and called for the ward nurse. He says that he is unable to take deep breaths and has a sharp pain on the right side of his chest with each inspiration. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.8°F), the pulse is 111/min, the respirations are 31/min, and the blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. He experiences pain in his right calf on dorsiflexion. There are no other prominent findings on physical examination. His chest X-ray does not show anything significant. The ECG reveals sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the best course of management at this time?",A,"The correct answer is B. CT scan.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as sudden difficulty breathing, sharp pain on the right side of his chest with each inspiration, and tachycardia, are highly suggestive of a pulmonary embolism (PE). The fact that he has been confined to bed for 5 days and has a positive Homan's sign (pain in the right calf on dorsiflexion) further supports this diagnosis.

Given the high index of suspicion for PE, the next step in management would be to order a diagnostic test to confirm the diagnosis. A CT scan with pulmonary angiography is the gold standard for diagnosing PE. It has a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting clot in the pulmonary arteries.

Option A, subcutaneous fondaparinux, is an anticoagulant that may be used for prophylaxis or treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), but it is not a diagnostic test.

Option C, inferior vena cava filter, is a therapeutic intervention that may be considered in patients with PE who have contraindications to anticoagulation or who have recurrent PE despite adequate anticoagulation. It is not a diagnostic test.

Option D, ventilation-perfusion scan, is a diagnostic test that can be used to diagnose PE, but it has been largely replaced by CT scan with pulmonary angiography due to its higher sensitivity and specificity.

Option E, lower extremity Doppler, is a diagnostic test that can be used to diagnose deep vein thrombosis (DVT), but it is not a definitive test for PE.

Therefore, the best course of management at this time is to order a CT scan with pulmonary angiography to confirm the diagnosis of PE.",Success
"A 62-year-old man is brought to his primary care physician by his wife who is concerned about the patient's frequent falls. Approximately 6 months ago, she started noticing that he was walking more slowly than usual. He has fallen more than 6 times in the past month, and she is worried that he will sustain a serious injury if he does not stop falling. The patient is a retired banking executive and was active as a triathlete until the age of 60. He does not smoke and drinks 2-3 alcoholic beverages per day. His family history is notable for normal pressure hydrocephalus in his mother and Alzheimer dementia in his father. His temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 131/81 mmHg, pulse is 68/min, and respirations are 19/min. On exam, his movements appear slowed and forced. He shuffles his feet when he walks. Tone is increased in his upper and lower extremities bilaterally. This patient's condition is most strongly associated with which of the following histologic findings on brain autopsy?",D,"The correct answer is D. Intracellular inclusions of alpha-synuclein.

The patient's symptoms, such as slowed and forced movements, shuffling gait, and increased tone in the upper and lower extremities, are consistent with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to motor symptoms.

On brain autopsy, Parkinson's disease is typically associated with the presence of Lewy bodies, which are intracellular inclusions composed of alpha-synuclein protein. Alpha-synuclein is a protein that is normally found in neurons, but in Parkinson's disease, it accumulates abnormally and forms insoluble fibrils that contribute to neuronal death.

The other options are associated with different neurodegenerative diseases:

A. Accumulations of beta-pleated sheets are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, which is associated with the deposition of amyloid beta peptides in the brain.

B. Atrophy of the caudate nucleus is a hallmark of Huntington's disease, a genetic disorder caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat in the Huntingtin gene.

C. Extracellular aggregates of amyloid beta are also characteristic of Alzheimer's disease.

E. Intracellular inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau are associated with frontotemporal dementia, a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the deposition of tau protein in the brain.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the histologic findings on brain autopsy, the correct answer is D. Intracellular inclusions of alpha-synuclein.",Success
"A 16-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a regular check-up. His mother says that he has not yet begun to walk. He is exclusively breastfed. He is at the 20th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 50th percentile for head circumference. Physical examination shows erosion of the enamel on the lingual surface of the incisors and carious molars. He has frontal bossing. His wrists are widened, his legs appear bowed, and there is beading of the ribs. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Impaired growth plate mineralization.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with rickets, a condition characterized by impaired mineralization of growing bone tissue. The key features that support this diagnosis include:

1. Delayed walking: Rickets can cause muscle weakness and bone deformities, leading to delayed motor milestones.
2. Enamel erosion and carious molars: Rickets can cause dental problems due to inadequate mineralization of tooth enamel.
3. Frontal bossing: Rickets can lead to cranial deformities, including frontal bossing.
4. Wrist widening, bowed legs, and beading of the ribs: These are all characteristic skeletal deformities seen in rickets, resulting from impaired mineralization of bone tissue.

The most common cause of rickets is vitamin D deficiency, which impairs growth plate mineralization. Breastfed infants are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency, especially if they have limited sun exposure or their mothers have inadequate vitamin D levels.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Deficiency of cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase is related to scurvy, which is characterized by bleeding gums, joint pain, and poor wound healing.

B. Defect in type I collagen is related to osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones and skeletal deformities.

D. Impaired osteoclast-mediated bone resorption is related to osteopetrosis, a rare genetic disorder characterized by increased bone density and skeletal deformities.

E. Mutation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 is related to achondroplasia, a genetic disorder characterized by short stature and skeletal deformities.

Therefore, impaired growth plate mineralization due to vitamin D deficiency is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition.",Success

The patient is treated urgently with intravenous fluid, dopamine, and broad spectrum antibiotics. The patient’s blood pressure improves to 101/70 mm Hg. On ultrasound of the abdomen, the common bile duct is dilated. What is the best next step in the management of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography).

Here's why:

The patient presents with altered mental status, fever, hypotension, and jaundice, suggesting a diagnosis of sepsis and cholangitis. The laboratory results show elevated bilirubin, AST, ALT, and ALP, indicating liver dysfunction and possible biliary obstruction. The ultrasound finding of a dilated common bile duct further supports this diagnosis.

Given the patient's critical condition and the need for urgent intervention, ERCP is the best next step. ERCP is a minimally invasive procedure that allows for visualization of the biliary tree, removal of any stones or debris, and potential stenting to relieve the obstruction. This can help to rapidly improve the patient's condition and reduce the risk of further complications.

While close monitoring (Option B) is important, it is not a definitive treatment for the patient's condition. MRCP (Option C) is a diagnostic test that may provide additional information, but it is not a therapeutic intervention. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (Option D) is an alternative to ERCP, but it is generally reserved for cases where ERCP is not possible or has failed. CT abdomen (Option E) may provide additional information about the patient's condition, but it is not a priority at this point, given the patient's critical condition and the need for urgent intervention.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American College of Gastroenterology and the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract, recommend ERCP as the treatment of choice for patients with acute cholangitis and biliary obstruction.",Success
"A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 5-month history of intermittent flank pain. Over the past 2 years, she has had five urinary tract infections.

Serum studies show a urea nitrogen concentration of 29 mg/dL and a creatinine concentration of 1.4 mg/dL. Renal ultrasonography shows bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple parenchymal anechoic masses. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as intermittent flank pain and recurrent urinary tract infections, are consistent with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).
* The physical examination finding of bilateral, nontender upper abdominal masses suggests the presence of enlarged kidneys, which is a hallmark of ADPKD.
* The renal ultrasonography results showing bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple parenchymal anechoic masses are also consistent with ADPKD. The anechoic masses are likely cysts, which are characteristic of this condition.
* The patient's age and family history (not mentioned in the question, but typically present in ADPKD) also support this diagnosis.
* The laboratory results, including elevated blood pressure and mild renal insufficiency (elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations), are also consistent with ADPKD.

In contrast:

* Medullary sponge kidney (Option A) typically presents with nephrolithiasis, hematuria, and recurrent UTIs, but it is not typically associated with bilateral, nontender upper abdominal masses or elevated blood pressure.
* Simple renal cysts (Option B) are usually asymptomatic and do not typically cause flank pain or recurrent UTIs.
* Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (Option D) typically presents in infancy or early childhood, and the patient's age and symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.
* Obstructive cystic dysplasia (Option E) is a rare condition that typically presents in infancy or early childhood, and the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

She reports that the pain started 2 weeks ago and is localized to the left hip and groin. The pain has been getting progressively more intense. Her temperature is 98.1°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 122/78 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for pain with manipulation without restriction of range of motion of the hip. Which of the following is the most sensitive test for this condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. MRI of the hip.

Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip, also known as osteonecrosis. AVN is a known complication of sarcoidosis, particularly in African-American patients.

MRI is the most sensitive test for diagnosing AVN of the hip. It can detect early changes in the bone marrow and trabecular structure, allowing for early diagnosis and treatment. MRI has a high sensitivity (80-100%) and specificity (90-100%) for detecting AVN.

CT scans (Option A) are not as sensitive as MRI for detecting AVN, especially in the early stages. Radiographs (Option C) may be normal in the early stages of AVN, and changes may not be visible until the disease has progressed. Radionuclide scans (Option D) can be useful for detecting AVN, but they are not as sensitive as MRI. Ultrasound (Option E) is not a reliable modality for diagnosing AVN of the hip.

According to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria, MRI is the recommended imaging modality for evaluating suspected AVN of the hip.",Success
"A 22-year-old man from Nepal presents to the emergency department complaining of swelling and pain in his right testicle.

The patient denies painful urination or urethral discharge, but admits that 10 days ago he “felt like he had a fever” and the right side of his face was swollen and painful. Which of the following is characteristic of the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is B. Dilation of the pampiniform plexus.

Based on the patient's symptoms, particularly the swelling and pain in the right testicle, accompanied by a history of fever and swelling on the right side of his face 10 days prior, the most likely diagnosis is epididymitis caused by mumps orchitis.

Mumps orchitis is a complication of mumps infection, which typically affects one testicle and can cause severe pain, swelling, and tenderness. The pampiniform plexus is a network of veins in the spermatic cord that can become dilated in response to inflammation, leading to testicular pain and swelling.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. While mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease, this option is not characteristic of the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.

C. A painless chancre is a characteristic of primary syphilis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

D. Buboes in the inguinal lymph nodes are characteristic of lymphogranuloma venereum, a sexually transmitted infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

E. Septic arthritis is not typically associated with mumps orchitis or epididymitis.

"A 27-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. The patient reports severe pelvic pain. Pregnancy has been complicated by gestational diabetes. Pregnancy and delivery of her first child were uncomplicated. Current medications include insulin, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Vital signs are within normal limits. The cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. Epidural anesthesia is performed and the patient's symptoms improve. Ten minutes later, the patient has dizziness. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's hypotension?",B,"The correct answer is B. Sympathetic block.

The patient's symptoms, specifically dizziness and hypotension (blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg), occurring 10 minutes after epidural anesthesia, suggest a sudden decrease in blood pressure. This is likely due to the sympathetic block caused by the epidural anesthesia.

Epidural anesthesia can cause a sympathetic block, which leads to vasodilation and a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. This can result in hypotension, particularly in patients who are not adequately volume-resuscitated. The patient's vital signs, including a pulse of 68/min and respirations of 16/min, do not suggest any other underlying causes of hypotension, such as cardiac issues or pulmonary hypertension.

Option A, decreased cardiac contractility, is unlikely given the patient's normal pulse rate. Option C, hypovolemia, may contribute to hypotension, but it is not the primary cause in this scenario, as the patient has just received epidural anesthesia. Option D, acute pulmonary hypertension, is not supported by the patient's symptoms or medical history. Option E, aortocaval compression, is a possibility during pregnancy, but it is less likely in this scenario, as the patient is already in the lithotomy position and has just received epidural anesthesia, which would help alleviate any compression.

The paramedic upon arrival noted that the patient had left-sided facial droop. Her medical history includes asthma and sickle cell disease. She takes hydroxyurea, uses oxycodone as needed for pain, and an albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath. The patient’s temperature is 97°F (36.1°C), blood pressure is 145/72 mmHg, pulse is 93/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. On physical examination, a left-sided facial droop is appreciated. She has trouble articulating her words, and her speech is garbled. She is put on 2 L of oxygen by nasal cannula. Labs are obtained and pending. Which of the following therapies is most likely indicated?",B,"The correct answer is A. Alteplase.

The patient's symptoms, including dysarthria (difficulty speaking) and left-sided facial droop, suggest a possible acute ischemic stroke. The patient's history of sudden onset of symptoms, especially the facial droop, is consistent with a stroke. Alteplase, a thrombolytic agent, is the most likely indicated therapy for acute ischemic stroke, as it can help dissolve the blood clot causing the stroke.

The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines recommend alteplase for eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke within 3-4.5 hours of symptom onset. The patient's symptoms started about an hour ago, making her a potential candidate for alteplase therapy.

The other options are not indicated in this scenario:

B. Exchange transfusion is a treatment for sickle cell disease, but it is not related to the patient's current symptoms.

C. Hydralazine is an antihypertensive medication, but the patient's blood pressure is not severely elevated, and this medication is not indicated for stroke treatment.

D. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist, which is used to reverse opioid overdose. There is no indication of opioid overdose in this patient.

E. Warfarin is an anticoagulant medication, which is used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation or other conditions. However, it is not indicated for acute ischemic stroke treatment.

It is essential to note that before administering alteplase, the patient should undergo a thorough evaluation, including imaging studies (e.g., CT or MRI) to confirm the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke and rule out other conditions, such as hemorrhagic stroke or other mimics. Additionally, the patient's labs and other test results should be reviewed to ensure she meets the criteria for alteplase therapy.",Success
"A 58-year-old male is hospitalized after sustaining multiple fractures in a severe automobile accident. Soon after hospitalization, he develops respiratory distress with crackles present bilaterally on physical examination. The patient does not respond to mechanical ventilation and 100% oxygen and quickly dies due to respiratory insufficiency. Autopsy reveals heavy, red lungs and histology is shown in Image A. Which of the following is most likely to have been present in this patient shortly before death:",C,"The correct answer is C. Interstitial edema.

The patient's symptoms, such as respiratory distress, crackles on physical examination, and heavy, red lungs on autopsy, are consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The histology image (Image A) is likely showing diffuse alveolar damage, which is a hallmark of ARDS.

In ARDS, the lungs become inflamed and permeable, leading to the leakage of fluid and proteins from the blood vessels into the alveoli and interstitial spaces. This results in interstitial edema, which is a characteristic feature of ARDS.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and autopsy findings:

A. Diaphragmatic hypertrophy is not a common finding in ARDS, and it would not explain the patient's respiratory distress and autopsy findings.

B. Proliferation of bronchiolar mucous glands is not a characteristic feature of ARDS.

"A 6-year-old African American boy is referred to the hospital by his family physician for jaundice, normocytic anemia, and severe bone pain. He has a history of several episodes of mild bone pain in the past treated with over the counter analgesics. On physical examination, the child is icteric with nonspecific pain in his hands. His hands are swollen, tender, and warm. There is no chest pain, abdominal pain, fever, or hematuria. A complete metabolic panel and complete blood count with manual differential are performed:
Total bilirubin
8.4 mg/dL
WBC
9,800/mm3
Hemoglobin 
6.5 g/dL
MCV 82.3 fL
Platelet count  465,000/mm3
Reticulocyte 7%
Peripheral blood smear shows multiple clumps of elongated and curved cells and erythrocytes with nuclear remnant. The patient's hemoglobin electrophoresis result is pictured below. What is the most likely cause of his condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Sickle cell disease.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as jaundice, normocytic anemia, and severe bone pain, are consistent with sickle cell disease.
* The peripheral blood smear shows multiple clumps of elongated and curved cells, which are characteristic of sickled red blood cells.
* The hemoglobin electrophoresis result shows a dominant peak of HbS (sickle hemoglobin) and a smaller peak of HbF (fetal hemoglobin), which is consistent with sickle cell disease.
* The patient's hemoglobin level is 6.5 g/dL, which is low, and the reticulocyte count is 7%, which indicates a compensatory response to anemia.
* The presence of nuclear remnants (Howell-Jolly bodies) on the peripheral blood smear also supports the diagnosis of sickle cell disease.

Option A, sickle cell trait, is unlikely because the patient's symptoms are more severe than what is typically seen in individuals with sickle cell trait. Sickle cell trait is usually asymptomatic, and the hemoglobin electrophoresis pattern would show a dominant peak of HbA (adult hemoglobin) with a smaller peak of HbS.

Option C, hemoglobin F, is not a disease entity and is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Hemoglobin F is a normal component of fetal hemoglobin, and its presence is not diagnostic of a specific condition.

Option D, hemoglobin SC, is a possibility, but the hemoglobin electrophoresis pattern would show a dominant peak of HbS and a smaller peak of HbC, which is not consistent with the patient's results.

Option E, HbC, is unlikely because the patient's symptoms are more severe than what is typically seen in individuals with HbC disease, and the hemoglobin electrophoresis pattern would show a dominant peak of HbC, which is not consistent with the patient's results.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and hemoglobin electrophoresis pattern, the most likely cause of his condition is sickle cell disease.",Success
"A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with complaints of nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and dizziness, which have lasted for the past 3 hours. He was diagnosed with heart failure 1 year ago. During his last visit to his primary care physician, he was doing well and the lab results were normal. He reports that he has been taking low-dose aspirin and digoxin regularly for 1 year, and verapamil was recently added to prevent his frequent migraine headaches. An electrocardiogram is performed urgently and shows paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block. Suspecting digitalis toxicity, the emergency medicine physician sends blood to the lab for a serum digoxin level, which is 3.7 ng/mL (therapeutic range: 0.8–2 ng/mL). Which of the following mechanisms most likely explains the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and dizziness, are consistent with digitalis toxicity. The elevated serum digoxin level (3.7 ng/mL) confirms the diagnosis. The question asks about the mechanism that led to digitalis toxicity in this patient.

Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, was recently added to the patient's medication regimen to prevent migraine headaches. Verapamil is known to inhibit P-glycoprotein, a transmembrane protein that plays a crucial role in the efflux of digoxin from the gut and kidneys. By inhibiting P-glycoprotein, verapamil reduces the elimination of digoxin, leading to increased serum levels and toxicity.

The other options are not directly related to the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient:

A. Drug-induced hypokalemia: While hypokalemia can potentiate digitalis toxicity, there is no indication that the patient has hypokalemia or that it is caused by another medication.

B. Increased intestinal absorption of digoxin: There is no evidence to suggest that the patient's intestinal absorption of digoxin has increased.

C. Inhibition of CYP 3A4 isoenzyme: Digoxin is not metabolized by the CYP 3A4 isoenzyme, so inhibition of this enzyme would not affect digoxin levels.

E. Increased enterohepatic circulation of digoxin: While enterohepatic circulation can contribute to digoxin toxicity, there is no indication that this mechanism is responsible for the patient's toxicity.

In summary, the inhibition of P-glycoprotein by verapamil is the most likely explanation for the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient.",Success
"A 36-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 25 minutes after being involved in a high speed motor-vehicle collision in which he was an unrestrained passenger. He has acute myeloid leukemia and is currently receiving chemotherapy. On arrival, his temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 63/min, respirations are 10/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and sluggish. There are multiple bruises over the face, trunk, and right upper and lower extremities. There is a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over his right cheek. He does not respond to any commands, but does groan. Painful stimuli cause him to open his eyes and withdraw all extremities. There are decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. There is tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and shows diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. There is swelling of the right elbow and wrist. The right lower extremity is shorter than the left lower extremity. There are 2 lacerations around 2 cm (0.8 in) each on the right leg. The right knee is swollen. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",E,"The correct answer is E. Intubation and mechanical ventilation.

This patient is critically injured and has multiple life-threatening injuries, including possible head trauma, lung contusion, and abdominal trauma. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is 8 (opens eyes to pain, withdraws to pain, and makes incomprehensible sounds), indicating severe impairment. He is not responding to commands and has decreased breath sounds over the right lung base, which suggests respiratory compromise.

Given the patient's compromised neurological status and potential respiratory failure, intubation and mechanical ventilation are the most appropriate next step in management. This will help to secure his airway, ensure adequate oxygenation, and prevent further deterioration.

While the other options may be important in the overall management of this patient, they are not the most immediate priority. Focussed assessment sonography for trauma (FAST) (Option A) may be useful in evaluating for intra-abdominal bleeding, but it is not as urgent as addressing the patient's airway and breathing. Insertion of an intercostal chest tube (Option B) may be necessary if a pneumothorax is suspected, but it is not the most immediate priority. CT scan of the head and neck (Option C) may be useful in evaluating for head trauma, but it is not as urgent as securing the patient's airway. X-rays of the extremities (Option D) may be useful in evaluating for fractures, but they are not as critical as addressing the patient's respiratory status.

It is essential to prioritize the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs) in this scenario, and intubation and mechanical ventilation are the most appropriate next step in management.",Success
"A 51-year-old woman was recently diagnosed with type II diabetes. Due to the cumulative effects of diabetes, various health screenings and vaccinations are routinely recommended. Which of the following vaccinations or screening measures are recommended in patients with diabetes?",B,"The correct answer is B. Comprehensive foot exam every year.

According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), patients with diabetes are at increased risk for various complications, including foot ulcers and amputations. A comprehensive foot exam is recommended annually to identify any potential issues early on and prevent complications.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Urinalysis every 6 months: While urinalysis is an important diagnostic tool for monitoring kidney function and detecting microalbuminuria, the recommended frequency is not every 6 months. The ADA recommends annual screening for albuminuria in patients with diabetes.

C. Weekly foot inspections by patient or family member: While regular foot self-exams are important for patients with diabetes, the recommended frequency is daily, not weekly. Patients should inspect their feet daily for any signs of ulcers, redness, or other abnormalities.

D. Hepatitis A vaccination series: While the CDC recommends Hepatitis A vaccination for certain high-risk groups, such as travelers to countries with high endemicity and individuals with liver disease, it is not specifically recommended for patients with diabetes.

E. Meningococcal vaccine: Meningococcal vaccination is recommended for certain high-risk groups, such as college students and individuals with asplenia or complement deficiencies, but it is not specifically recommended for patients with diabetes.

In summary, a comprehensive foot exam every year is a recommended screening measure for patients with diabetes to prevent foot-related complications.",Success
A 23-year-old man presents with sudden loss of consciousness while pitching in a baseball game. There is no history of injury. Consciousness is regained after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Past medical history is negative for any neurological and cardiovascular problems. Physical examination reveals a prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse and a double apical impulse. There are no audible murmurs. An S4 is present. What is the most likely diagnosis?,B,"The correct answer is B. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Here's why:

* The patient's sudden loss of consciousness during physical exertion (pitching in a baseball game) suggests a cardiac etiology.
* The physical examination findings are consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:
	+ Prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse indicates increased right atrial pressure, which can be seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to diastolic dysfunction.
	+ Double apical impulse is a characteristic finding in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, resulting from the abnormal contraction pattern of the hypertrophied ventricle.
	+ The presence of an S4 gallop rhythm is also consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, indicating a stiff and non-compliant left ventricle.
* The absence of audible murmurs does not rule out hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as the murmur may be absent or soft in some cases.
* The other options are less likely:
	+ Dilated cardiomyopathy (A) would typically present with signs of heart failure, such as jugular venous distension, pedal edema, and a displaced apical impulse.
	+ Aortic stenosis (C) would typically present with a systolic ejection murmur, which is not mentioned in the scenario.
	+ Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (D) is a stress-induced cardiomyopathy that typically affects older adults, often with a history of emotional or physical stress, and is characterized by a distinctive ""ballooning"" pattern of the left ventricle on imaging.
	+ Restrictive cardiomyopathy (E) is a rare condition characterized by impaired ventricular filling, often due to infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, and would not typically present with a double apical impulse or S4 gallop rhythm.

Overall, the combination of physical examination findings and the patient's presentation are most consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",Success
"A 39-year-old man is brought to the emergency department unconscious following 2 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. According to the attendants, he has complained of recurrent headaches for the past 2 weeks. There is no history of fever, head trauma, or a seizure disorder. The patient does not smoke cigarettes but reportedly drinks 2 glasses of wine daily. He has multiple sexual partners and history regarding the contraceptive use is unavailable. The patient’s vitals include: blood pressure 137/88 mm Hg, temperature 37.2°C (99.0°F). On physical examination, he is obtunded. He grimaces on pain and localizes in response to pain in both upper extremities. Pupils are bilateral 3-mm in diameter and equally round and reactive. Laboratory tests are within normal limits. An MRI of the brain with contrast is shown in the exhibit (see image). A brain biopsy is performed that reveals perivascular clusters of lymphocytes. Which of the following is most associated with this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is B. Human herpes virus.

The patient's symptoms, including recurrent headaches, seizures, and obtundation, suggest a central nervous system (CNS) infection or inflammation. The MRI with contrast shows a ring-enhancing lesion, which is consistent with a CNS lesion. The brain biopsy revealing perivascular clusters of lymphocytes further supports an inflammatory or infectious process.

Given the patient's history of multiple sexual partners, the most likely association is with Human herpes virus (HHV), specifically HHV-2 or herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2). HSV-2 is a common cause of CNS infections, including meningitis and encephalitis, and can present with seizures, headaches, and altered mental status.

While Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can cause CNS infections, it is more commonly associated with infectious mononucleosis and lymphoproliferative disorders. Human papilloma virus (HPV) is not typically associated with CNS infections. Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) can cause a demyelinating disease, but it is not typically associated with the patient's symptoms. Schistosoma haematobium is a parasitic infection that can cause CNS lesions, but it is less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

It is essential to note that the patient's history of multiple sexual partners and potential exposure to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) should prompt further evaluation and testing for STIs, including HIV, syphilis, and others, in addition to HSV-2.",Success
"A 22-year-old woman from a rural area who recently discovered she was pregnant is referred for a cardiology consultation due to cyanosis, dyspnea, and a cardiac murmur revealed at the initial prenatal visit. She is gravida 1, para 0 with an estimated gestational age of 19 weeks. She says that the murmur was found in her childhood, and the doctor at that time placed her under observation only. However, she has been lost to follow-up and has not had proper follow up in years. Currently, she complains of dizziness and occasional dyspnea on exertion which has gradually increased during her pregnancy. Prior to her pregnancy, she did not have any symptoms. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, heart rate 81/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F). Her examination is significant for acrocyanosis and a fixed splitting of S2 and grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border. Which of the following physiological pregnancy changes is causing the change in this patient’s condition?",C,"The correct answer is D. Increase in cardiac output.

The patient's symptoms, such as dizziness and dyspnea on exertion, have worsened during pregnancy, suggesting that the physiological changes of pregnancy are exacerbating her underlying cardiac condition. The key finding is the fixed splitting of S2 and the grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur, which is consistent with an atrial septal defect (ASD).

During pregnancy, cardiac output increases by 30-50% due to increased blood volume and heart rate. This increase in cardiac output can lead to increased flow across the ASD, resulting in increased right-to-left shunting and worsening cyanosis. The patient's symptoms, such as dizziness and dyspnea, are likely due to decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's worsening symptoms:

A. Increase in pulmonary vascular resistance would actually decrease the shunt flow and improve oxygenation.

B. Increase in heart rate is a normal physiological response to pregnancy, but it is not the primary cause of the patient's worsening symptoms.

C. Decrease in systemic vascular resistance is a normal response to pregnancy, which would actually decrease the pressure gradient across the ASD and improve symptoms.

E. Increase in blood volume is a normal response to pregnancy, but it is not the primary cause of the patient's worsening symptoms. The increase in blood volume contributes to the increase in cardiac output, which is the primary cause of the patient's worsening symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Increase in cardiac output.",Success

Physical exam demonstrates an ill appearing young man. Physical exam is notable for rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and piloerection. The patient’s pupils are dilated and reactive to light. During placement of an ultrasound guided IV, multiple scars are noted in the antecubital fossa, and it is noted that it is very difficult to place an IV in this patient. During the exam, he begins actively vomiting. Which of the following could be an appropriate treatment for this patient’s symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is D. Naloxone.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, it appears that the patient is experiencing opioid withdrawal. The presence of rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and piloerection, along with dilated and reactive pupils, are all consistent with opioid withdrawal. The patient's history of constipation and fibromyalgia may suggest a history of chronic pain management, and the multiple scars in the antecubital fossa suggest a history of intravenous drug use.

Naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist that can help to rapidly reverse opioid withdrawal symptoms. It is often used in the treatment of opioid overdose, but it can also be used to treat opioid withdrawal.

Clonidine (Option A) is sometimes used to treat opioid withdrawal, but it is not as effective as naloxone in rapidly reversing symptoms.

Diazepam taper (Option B) is not an appropriate treatment for opioid withdrawal, as benzodiazepines can worsen withdrawal symptoms and increase the risk of seizures.

Haloperidol and diphenhydramine (Option C) are not typically used to treat opioid withdrawal.

Oseltamivir (Option E) is an antiviral medication used to treat influenza, and it is not relevant to this patient's symptoms.

It's important to note that the patient should also receive supportive care, such as fluids and electrolyte replacement, and may require further evaluation and management to address any underlying substance use disorder.",Success

While cleaning the house, they discovered a nest of spiders. She reports blacking out and waking up outside the house with a bandage on her arm. Her husband says that she began screaming and ran out of the house, breaking a window, and cutting her arm. The patient says she has tried to enter the house several times over the last several months but can not bring herself to cross the threshold for fear of more spiders. She wants to overcome her extreme and irrational fear. Which of the following is the most effective treatment to overcome this patient’s arachnophobia?",A,"The correct answer is A. Desensitization.

The patient is experiencing a specific phobia, arachnophobia, which is an excessive and irrational fear of spiders. Desensitization, also known as exposure therapy, is a type of behavioral therapy that is highly effective in treating specific phobias.

Desensitization involves gradually exposing the patient to the feared object or situation (in this case, spiders or the house) in a controlled and safe environment, while teaching them relaxation techniques to manage their anxiety response. The goal is to help the patient learn to cope with their fear and eventually become comfortable with the previously feared stimulus.

The other options are not the most effective treatments for arachnophobia:

B. Paroxetine is an antidepressant medication that may be used to treat anxiety disorders, but it is not specifically indicated for treating phobias.

C. Metoprolol is a beta blocker medication that may be used to treat anxiety symptoms, but it is not a first-line treatment for phobias.

D. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine medication that may be used to treat anxiety disorders, but it is not recommended as a long-term treatment for phobias due to the risk of dependence and withdrawal.

E. Psychotherapy is a broad term that encompasses various forms of talk therapy. While psychotherapy can be helpful in addressing underlying issues, it is not a specific treatment for phobias. Desensitization, a type of behavioral therapy, is a more targeted and effective approach for treating arachnophobia.

"A 67-year-old man is brought to the physician because of increasing forgetfulness, unsteadiness, and falls over the past year. He reports that these symptoms seem to worsen with each fall. Initially, he could not remember directions to his home but now cannot remember recent conversations or appointments he has made. He often repeats questions that he asked shortly before. He has long-standing hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include aspirin, carvedilol, enalapril, and atorvastatin. Examination shows a bruise over the left temple and an unsteady gait. On mental status examination, he is oriented to place and person only. Short-term memory is impaired; he can recall 0 out of 5 objects after 10 minutes. Long-term memory is intact. He has no delusions or hallucinations. Muscle strength is decreased in the left lower extremity. The Babinski sign is present on the left. A CT scan of the head is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",E,"The correct answer is C. Cerebral shunting.

The patient's symptoms, including increasing forgetfulness, unsteadiness, and falls, are consistent with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The CT scan of the head likely shows enlarged ventricles, which is a hallmark of NPH. The patient's mental status examination, including impaired short-term memory and intact long-term memory, also supports this diagnosis.

Cerebral shunting is the most appropriate next step in management for NPH. Shunting involves surgically inserting a device to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid from the ventricles and relieve pressure on the brain. This can help alleviate symptoms and improve cognitive function.

Option A, Warfarin therapy, is not indicated for NPH. Warfarin is an anticoagulant used to prevent stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, but it is not related to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.

Option B, Vitamin E therapy, is not a treatment for NPH. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that has been studied for its potential role in preventing or slowing cognitive decline, but it is not a specific treatment for NPH.

Option D, Tetrabenazine therapy, is a medication used to treat chorea, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary movements. It is not related to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.

Option E, Cognitive training, may be a useful adjunctive therapy for patients with NPH, but it is not a primary treatment for the condition. Cognitive training can help patients compensate for cognitive deficits, but it does not address the underlying cause of the symptoms.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms and CT scan results, cerebral shunting is the most appropriate next step in management for NPH.",Success
"A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 39 weeks gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. On examination, the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated. After 5 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration of the fetal heart rate to 90/min. A decision to perform an episiotomy is made to expedite vaginal delivery. The anesthesiologist locates the ischial spines by palpating the posterolateral vaginal sidewall and administers an anesthetic. Three minutes later, pinching the posterior vulva does not provoke pain. The anesthetized nerve most likely also supplies which of the following structures?",C,"The correct answer is C. External anal sphincter.

The scenario describes the administration of an anesthetic to facilitate an episiotomy, which suggests a pudendal nerve block. The pudendal nerve is responsible for innervating the perineum, including the external anal sphincter. The fact that pinching the posterior vulva does not provoke pain after the anesthetic administration further supports this conclusion.

The pudendal nerve provides sensory innervation to the perineum, including the external anal sphincter, as well as motor innervation to the external anal sphincter and other pelvic floor muscles. Therefore, it is likely that the anesthetized nerve also supplies the external anal sphincter.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Obturator externus muscle: The obturator externus muscle is innervated by the obturator nerve (L3-L4), not the pudendal nerve.

B. Skin of the lateral thigh: The skin of the lateral thigh is innervated by the femoral nerve (L2-L4) and the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (L2-L3), not the pudendal nerve.

D. Skin of the mons pubis: The skin of the mons pubis is innervated by the ilioinguinal nerve (L1) and the genitofemoral nerve (L1-L2), not the pudendal nerve.

E. Detrusor muscle: The detrusor muscle is innervated by the pelvic nerve (S2-S4), not the pudendal nerve.

Breath sounds are absent on the right side and the neck veins are distended. Telemetry shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Needle thoracostomy.

The patient's sudden deterioration in respiratory status, with severe respiratory distress, hypotension, and deviated trachea, suggests a tension pneumothorax. The absent breath sounds on the right side and distended neck veins further support this diagnosis. Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention.

Needle thoracostomy is the best next step in management, as it can help to rapidly decompress the tension pneumothorax and relieve the pressure on the lungs and heart. This procedure involves inserting a large-bore needle into the chest cavity to release the trapped air and alleviate the tension.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Discontinuing antibiotics is not relevant to the patient's current crisis and would not address the tension pneumothorax.

B. Administering epinephrine may be considered in the context of anaphylaxis or cardiac arrest, but it is not indicated in this scenario.

C. Performing an arterial blood gas (ABG) may provide useful information about the patient's oxygenation and acid-base status, but it would not address the immediate life-threatening situation.

E. Obtaining a stat chest X-ray may be useful for confirming the diagnosis, but it would not provide immediate relief to the patient and may delay necessary treatment.

A 22-year-old woman with polycystic ovarian syndrome comes to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of left lower abdominal pain that began suddenly while she was running. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. Physical examination shows tenderness to palpation over the left adnexa and rebound tenderness in the left lower quadrant. There is no tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Urine pregnancy test is negative. An ultrasound is ordered to confirm the diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst. Visualization of fluid in which of the following locations would be most consistent with this diagnosis?,B,"The correct answer is A. Lesser sac.

Here's why:

In a patient with suspected ruptured ovarian cyst, the ultrasound finding of fluid in the lesser sac would be most consistent with this diagnosis. The lesser sac is a potential space located between the stomach and the posterior wall of the lesser omentum. It is a common location for fluid accumulation in cases of ruptured ovarian cysts, as the fluid can track up from the pelvis through the paracolic gutters and into the lesser sac.

The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst:

* B. Rectouterine pouch (also known as the pouch of Douglas) is a potential space between the rectum and the uterus, and while it may contain fluid in cases of ruptured ovarian cyst, it is not as specific to this diagnosis as the lesser sac.
* C. Hepatorenal space (also known as Morrison's pouch) is a potential space between the liver and the right kidney, and is not typically associated with ruptured ovarian cysts.
* D. Splenorenal angle is a region in the left upper quadrant where the spleen and kidney meet, and is not related to the diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst.
* E. Rectovesical pouch is a potential space between the rectum and the bladder, and is not specific to the diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst.

It's worth noting that ultrasound is a useful diagnostic tool in evaluating patients with suspected ruptured ovarian cyst, as it can help identify the presence of fluid in the pelvis or abdomen, as well as any associated ovarian pathology. However, the diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst is often made clinically, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, and may be confirmed with laparoscopy or laparotomy if necessary.",Success
"A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She has noticed trembling of her hands for the past 5 months. These movements are only present when she reaches to pick up an object or answer the phone. She has a history of major depressive disorder but has been off medications for the past 3 years. Her father had Parkinson's disease and died 6 months ago. She drinks a glass of wine daily. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 118/74 mm Hg. A low-frequency tremor is present that worsens as she reaches out for an object. She consistently overshoots her target. There is no tremor present when her arms are held outstretched. There is increased tone in the lower extremities and Babinski's sign is positive bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is E. Subthalamic nucleus stroke.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of ataxic tremor, which is a type of tremor that is characterized by a low-frequency, intentional tremor (i.e., it worsens when reaching for an object). The presence of increased tone in the lower extremities and bilateral Babinski's sign suggests upper motor neuron involvement, which is not typical of Parkinson's disease or essential tremor.

The key feature that points to a subthalamic nucleus stroke is the presence of an intentional tremor that worsens when reaching for an object, accompanied by signs of upper motor neuron involvement. The subthalamic nucleus is a structure in the basal ganglia that plays a critical role in motor control, and damage to this area can result in ataxic tremor and other motor symptoms.

Cerebellar demyelination (Option A) can cause ataxia, but it would not typically cause an intentional tremor or upper motor neuron signs. Degenerated substantia nigra (Option B) is more consistent with Parkinson's disease, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Degenerated caudate nucleus (Option C) is more consistent with Huntington's disease, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Essential tremor (Option D) typically presents with a postural tremor, not an intentional tremor, and is not associated with upper motor neuron signs.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, a subthalamic nucleus stroke is the most likely cause of her symptoms.",Success

He has had similar symptoms occasionally in the past as well. Four months ago, he had an episode of narrow-angle glaucoma. He takes no medications. His vital signs are within normal limits. Nasal exam shows clear, serous secretions, with edematous and erythematous mucosa and turbinates. Paranasal sinuses are not tender to palpation. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",C,"The correct answer is C. Fexofenadine.

The patient's symptoms, including generalized pruritus, raised erythematous plaques, clear liquid discharge from the nose, and sneezing, are consistent with an allergic reaction, specifically an acute allergic response. The sudden onset of symptoms 30 minutes after dinner at a seafood restaurant suggests an IgE-mediated food allergy.

Fexofenadine is a non-sedating, second-generation antihistamine that is commonly used to treat allergic reactions, including urticaria and angioedema. It is a suitable choice for this patient's symptoms.

Diphenhydramine (Option A) is also an antihistamine, but it is sedating and may cause drowsiness, which may not be desirable in this patient.

Amoxicillin (Option B) is an antibiotic and is not indicated for an allergic reaction.

Vitamin K (Option D) is not related to the treatment of allergic reactions.

Calamine lotion (Option E) is a topical cream used to treat skin irritation and itching, but it is not a systemic treatment for an allergic reaction.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of narrow-angle glaucoma is important to consider when selecting a medication, as some antihistamines can exacerbate glaucoma. However, fexofenadine is generally considered safe in patients with glaucoma.",Success
"A 19-year-old man in a 3-month relationship with a woman experiences frequent sexual fantasies about male coworkers. He lives in a conservative community and does not know any openly gay men. Two days ago, he joined a local group considered by many organizations to be a hate group. Together with the other members, he attacked a gay couple on their way home from dinner. Which of the following psychological defense mechanisms is he demonstrating?",C,"The correct answer is C. Reaction formation.

Reaction formation is a psychological defense mechanism in which an individual adopts behaviors or attitudes that are opposite of their unconscious desires or impulses. In this case, the 19-year-old man is experiencing sexual fantasies about male coworkers, which suggests that he may have unconscious homosexual desires. However, due to the conservative community he lives in and the lack of openly gay men, he may feel threatened or ashamed by these desires.

By joining a hate group and attacking a gay couple, the man is demonstrating a reaction formation. He is acting out in a way that is opposite of his unconscious desires, attempting to suppress or deny them. This behavior is a defense mechanism to avoid confronting his own feelings and to maintain a sense of heterosexuality.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Acting out refers to the expression of unconscious impulses or desires through behavior, often in a maladaptive way. While the man is acting out in a violent manner, this is not the primary defense mechanism at play.

B. Sublimation is a defense mechanism in which an individual channels unacceptable impulses into a more socially acceptable behavior. In this case, the man's behavior is not socially acceptable and is not a constructive way of dealing with his desires.

D. Intellectualization is a defense mechanism in which an individual focuses on the abstract or intellectual aspects of a situation to avoid dealing with the emotional implications. This does not apply to the man's behavior in this scenario.

E. Projection is a defense mechanism in which an individual attributes their own unacceptable thoughts or desires to someone else. While the man may be projecting his own desires onto the gay couple, this is not the primary defense mechanism at play.",Success
"A 66-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider with several days of left flank pain radiating to the abdomen and groin. The patient states that she has noticed a pink tinge to her urine as well. Of note, she has not had any fevers, but endorses several months of fatigue and constipation. The patient was previously healthy except for mild untreated hypertension. On exam, her temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 130/84 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 12/min. On further workup, the patient is found to have calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis with hypercalciuria. Blood studies demonstrate increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) and hypercalcemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",A,"The correct answer is A. Primary hyperparathyroidism.

Here's why:

The patient presents with symptoms of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), specifically flank pain radiating to the abdomen and groin, and hematuria (pink tinge to her urine). The workup reveals calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis with hypercalciuria, which is consistent with excessive calcium levels in the urine. Additionally, the patient has hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels in the blood) and increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition in which one or more of the four parathyroid glands in the neck become overactive and produce excessive amounts of PTH. This leads to hypercalcemia, which can cause a range of symptoms including kidney stones, fatigue, and constipation. The increased PTH levels and hypercalcemia in this patient are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism.

The other options can be ruled out based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results:

* B. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a rare genetic disorder characterized by resistance to PTH, leading to hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) rather than hypercalcemia.
* C. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism is a rare condition that is similar to pseudohypoparathyroidism but without the biochemical abnormalities. It is not consistent with the patient's presentation.
* D. Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs when another underlying condition, such as kidney disease or vitamin D deficiency, leads to increased PTH production. While the patient has kidney stones, there is no indication of underlying kidney disease or vitamin D deficiency.
* E. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is a rare condition that occurs when secondary hyperparathyroidism persists even after the underlying condition has been treated. It is not applicable in this case.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, making it the most likely cause.",Success
A 23-year-old woman presents to her psychiatrist concerned about her mood. She has felt tired and unwilling to engage in any activities lately. She states that her limbs feel heavy all the time and that completing any activity takes tremendous effort. She no longer finds any happiness in activities that she previously enjoyed. She also states that she really struggles to sleep and at times can't sleep for several days. The patient is started on appropriate first-line therapy and sent home. She returns 1 week later stating that her symptoms have not improved. She is requesting help as her performance at work and school is suffering. Which of the following is the best next step in management?,D,"The correct answer is D. Continue current therapy.

Here's why:

The patient has presented with symptoms of depression, including fatigue, anhedonia (loss of pleasure in activities), and sleep disturbances. The psychiatrist has started her on appropriate first-line therapy, which is likely an antidepressant medication such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).

The key point here is that the patient has only been on treatment for 1 week, which is a relatively short period of time. Antidepressant medications can take several weeks to start working, and it's common for patients not to experience significant improvement in symptoms within the first week.

The American Psychiatric Association (APA) guidelines recommend continuing the initial treatment for at least 4-6 weeks before considering a change in therapy. This allows for adequate time to assess the medication's effectiveness and to adjust the dosage as needed.

Adding lithium (Option A) or changing to duloxetine (Option B) may be considered later in the treatment course, but they are not the best next step at this point. Changing to lithium (Option C) is not a recommended strategy, as lithium is typically used as a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder, not for unipolar depression. Electroconvulsive therapy (Option E) is usually reserved for severe, treatment-resistant depression, which is not the case here.

Therefore, the best next step is to continue the current therapy (Option D) and reassess the patient's symptoms in a few weeks to determine if the treatment is effective.",Success
"A 16-year-old patient presents to the physician’s office with an absence of menstruations. Her last period was 6 months ago. Since almost a year and a half ago, she intentionally restricted her diet at the expense of carbohydrates, exercised intensively, and lost 18.0 kg (39.7 lb). She had her menarche at the age of 12 and menstruated normally until last year. She is not sexually active. On physical examination, the vital signs include blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate 55/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature 35.9°C (96.6°F). Her weight is 55.0 kg (121.3 lb), and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in). Physical examination reveals the good development of muscles and decreased adiposity. A bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits. Which statement about this patient’s condition is correct?",C,"The correct answer is C. Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient.

This patient presents with secondary amenorrhea, which is the cessation of menstruation in a woman who previously had regular periods. The patient's history of intentional diet restriction, intense exercise, and significant weight loss (18 kg) suggest that she may have developed a condition known as exercise-induced amenorrhea or athletic amenorrhea.

The patient's physical examination reveals decreased adiposity, which is a key factor in the development of hypoestrogenemia (low estrogen levels). Adipose tissue is an important site for estrogen production, and decreased body fat can lead to decreased estrogen levels. This, in turn, can disrupt the menstrual cycle and cause amenorrhea.

Option A is incorrect because hypertrophied muscles do not produce androgens that can interfere with the menstrual cycle. Option B is also incorrect because insulin resistance is not directly related to the patient's menstrual irregularities. Option D is incorrect because increased liver metabolism is not a direct consequence of the patient's condition, and it would not lead to decreased blood estrogen concentration. Option E is incorrect because hyperthyroidism is not directly related to the patient's condition, and extensive lipolysis is not a characteristic of hyperthyroidism.

The patient's bone scan showing decreased calcium mineral deposits is likely related to the decreased estrogen levels, which can lead to bone loss and osteoporosis. The patient's low body temperature and bradycardia (slow heart rate) may be related to her decreased metabolic rate due to malnutrition and weight loss.",Success
"A 7-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with a 10-day history of fever and sore throat that acutely worsened over the past 2 days. Her sore throat is worse on the right side.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",C,"The correct answer is D. Needle aspiration and oral clindamycin therapy.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including a 10-day history of fever and sore throat that acutely worsened over the past 2 days, difficulty swallowing and opening her mouth due to pain, and a change in the quality of her voice, suggest a diagnosis of peritonsillar abscess (PTA). The examination findings, including cervical lymphadenopathy, erythematous tonsils, and swelling of the right tonsillar pillar, with the uvula deviated to the left, further support this diagnosis.

PTA is a complication of tonsillitis, where an abscess forms between the tonsillar capsule and the surrounding tissues. The treatment of choice for PTA is drainage of the abscess, which can be done through needle aspiration or incision and drainage.

In this case, the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a small to moderate-sized abscess, which can be managed with needle aspiration and oral antibiotics. Needle aspiration is a less invasive procedure compared to incision and drainage, and it can be done under local anesthesia.

Clindamycin is a suitable antibiotic choice for PTA, as it covers the common pathogens involved, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobes.

The other options are not the most appropriate next step in management:

A. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy may be used to reduce inflammation and pain, but it is not the primary treatment for PTA.

B. Tonsillectomy is not indicated in the acute setting, as it may worsen the infection and increase the risk of bleeding.

C. Incision and drainage with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy may be necessary for larger abscesses or those that do not respond to needle aspiration, but it is a more invasive procedure.

E. Intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy alone is not sufficient to manage a PTA, as drainage of the abscess is necessary to resolve the infection.",Success
"A 26-year-old nurse comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue.

Potassium 3.9 mEq/L
Calcium 8.5 mg/dL
Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Abdominal ultrasonography show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?""",A,"The correct answer is A. Factitious disorder.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation, laboratory results, and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of factitious disorder, also known as Munchausen syndrome. This is a psychiatric disorder in which a person fabricates or induces illness in themselves to gain attention, sympathy, and emotional fulfillment.

The clues pointing to factitious disorder are:

1. The patient's insistence on having cancer and requesting a diagnostic laparoscopy, despite the lack of supporting symptoms or signs.
2. The presence of numerous crusts along the course of her left arm veins, suggesting self-induced injection or infusion of substances.
3. The patient's pale appearance, fatigue, and generalized weakness, which could be caused by self-induced anemia or blood loss.
4. The laboratory results showing a low hemoglobin level (7.5 g/dL) with a high reticulocyte count (13.3%), indicating active bleeding or hemolysis.
5. The absence of any underlying medical condition that could explain the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

The other options are not supported by the patient's presentation and laboratory results:

B. Somatic symptom disorder is a condition characterized by excessive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to physical symptoms. While the patient does have somatic symptoms, the presence of factitious signs (e.g., crusts on the arm) and laboratory results suggest a more intentional and manipulative behavior.

C. Conversion disorder is a condition in which psychological distress is converted into physical symptoms. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support a conversion disorder diagnosis.

D. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition characterized by elevated calcium levels. The patient's calcium level is within normal limits, making this diagnosis unlikely.

E. Acute small bowel hemorrhage is a possibility, but the patient's laboratory results and physical examination findings do not support this diagnosis. The absence of occult blood in the stool also makes this diagnosis less likely.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis is factitious disorder, which is supported by the patient's behavior, physical examination findings, and laboratory results.",Success

Abdominal ultrasonography shows an enlarged liver. A biopsy of the liver shows massive centrilobular necrosis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?""",A,"The correct answer is A. Adverse effect of anesthetic.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and liver biopsy findings are consistent with halothane-induced hepatitis, a rare but serious adverse effect of general inhalational anesthesia, particularly with halothane.

The key indicators pointing to this diagnosis are:

1. The patient developed symptoms 5 days after surgery, which is a typical latency period for halothane-induced hepatitis.
2. The presence of jaundice, abdominal pain, and low-grade fever are common symptoms of this condition.
3. The laboratory results show a significant elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, which is indicative of liver damage.
4. The liver biopsy reveals massive centrilobular necrosis, a characteristic finding in halothane-induced hepatitis.
5. The patient's eosinophilia (13% eosinophils) is also consistent with an allergic reaction to the anesthetic agent.

The other options are unlikely causes of the patient's condition:

B. Gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream would typically cause a more severe infection, such as sepsis, with a higher fever and a left shift in the white blood cell count.

C. Trauma to the bile duct would likely cause more localized abdominal pain and potentially lead to bile peritonitis.

D. Acalculous inflammation of the gallbladder (acalculous cholecystitis) would typically present with more severe right upper quadrant pain and a higher white blood cell count.

E. Excessive lysis of red blood cells would not explain the patient's liver enzyme elevations and biopsy findings.

In summary, the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and liver biopsy findings are consistent with halothane-induced hepatitis, making option A the most likely underlying cause of her condition.",Success

Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Bone marrow biopsy.

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is aplastic anemia, a condition characterized by pancytopenia (low levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) due to bone marrow failure.

The laboratory results support this diagnosis:

* Low hemoglobin (8.7 mg/dL) and reticulocyte count (0.1%) indicate anemia.
* Low leukocyte count (1100/mm3) indicates leukopenia.
* Low platelet count (54,000/mm3) indicates thrombocytopenia.
* Normal serum bilirubin and LDH levels rule out hemolysis as the cause of anemia.

A bone marrow biopsy is the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis of aplastic anemia. It will show a hypocellular bone marrow with a decreased number of hematopoietic stem cells, which is characteristic of aplastic anemia.

The other options are not directly related to confirming the diagnosis of aplastic anemia:

* A. Serum transferrin level is not relevant to this diagnosis.
* C. Flow cytometry is typically used to diagnose and monitor hematological malignancies, such as leukemia, but it is not specific for aplastic anemia.
* D. Peripheral blood smear may show pancytopenia, but it is not diagnostic for aplastic anemia.
* E. Serum porphobilinogen level is related to porphyria, a different condition.

"A 35-year-old man returns to the clinic to follow up for his chronic stomach pain. At the last visit a few months ago, he explained that he had been experiencing discomfort in his upper abdomen for awhile. He had never vomited up any blood and had not had any substantial weight loss. He did not take any medications, did not smoke, and had no family history of gastric cancer. At that time, the doctor empirically started him on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Today, despite the PPI, the patient says he is still experiencing discomfort. Hearing this, the doctor decides to order a urease breath test. What is the most likely cause of this patient's chronic stomach pain?",D,"The correct answer is D. Helicobacter pylori infection.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms of chronic upper abdominal discomfort, despite being on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), suggest that the cause of his symptoms may not be related to acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The doctor's decision to order a urease breath test, which is a diagnostic test for H. pylori infection, suggests that H. pylori is a likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

H. pylori is a common cause of chronic gastritis, which can present with symptoms of epigastric pain, nausea, and bloating. The fact that the patient has not responded to PPI therapy, which is typically effective in relieving symptoms of GERD, further supports the possibility of H. pylori infection.

The other options are less likely:

A. Gastric neoplasm is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of alarm symptoms such as weight loss, vomiting, or bleeding.

B. Gastroesophageal sphincter dysfunction is possible, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with gastritis than GERD.

C. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not mentioned in the patient's history, and even if they were, the patient's symptoms would likely respond to PPI therapy.

E. Excessive gastrin is not a common cause of chronic stomach pain, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with H. pylori infection.

According to current medical guidelines, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) recommends testing for H. pylori in patients with dyspepsia, especially those who have not responded to PPI therapy.",Success

She has no history of sexually transmitted disease, intravenous drug use, or blood transfusions, and she has never traveled outside of the United States. She was up-to-date on all immunizations before her pregnancy. Ultrasound is consistent with an 8-week gestational sac. The patient requests as few tests as possible, although she does not want to compromise the health of her fetus. Which of the following screening tests should be performed on all pregnant women?",A,"The correct answer is A. HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend that all pregnant women be screened for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B during their initial prenatal visit. This is because these infections can have significant consequences for the mother and fetus if left untreated.

HIV screening is essential to identify infected women and provide them with antiretroviral therapy to reduce the risk of vertical transmission to the fetus.

Syphilis screening is crucial to prevent congenital syphilis, which can cause severe morbidity and mortality in the fetus.

Hepatitis B screening is necessary to identify infected women and provide them with antiviral therapy to reduce the risk of vertical transmission to the fetus. Additionally, hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for all newborns, and identifying infected mothers allows for appropriate prophylaxis and vaccination of the infant.

While N. gonorrhea and C. trachomatis are important infections to screen for in certain populations, they are not universally recommended for all pregnant women. Hepatitis C screening is recommended for high-risk populations, such as those with a history of intravenous drug use or blood transfusions, but it is not universally recommended for all pregnant women.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer, as it includes the three infections that are universally recommended for screening in all pregnant women.",Success

His wife also says that he has begun to doubt her fidelity and believes that even the marriage counselor is on her side. Which of the following psychiatric disorders also belongs to the same cluster of symptoms?,A,"The correct answer is A. Schizotypal personality disorder.

The patient's symptoms, as described by his wife, are consistent with Paranoid Personality Disorder (PPD). The key features of PPD include:

* Suspiciousness and mistrust of others, even without sufficient basis
* Tendency to read hidden meanings into benign events or remarks
* Preoccupation with doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness of others
* Reluctance to confide in others due to fear of being exploited or harmed
* Quickness to take offense or become angry when perceived slights occur

PPD belongs to Cluster A personality disorders, which also includes Schizotypal Personality Disorder and Schizoid Personality Disorder. These disorders are characterized by odd or eccentric behaviors, thoughts, or feelings.

Schizotypal Personality Disorder shares some similarities with PPD, such as suspiciousness and mistrust, but it is distinguished by the presence of magical thinking, unusual perceptual experiences, and eccentric behavior.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms:

* Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (B) is characterized by perfectionism, rigidity, and a preoccupation with details, rules, and order.
* Antisocial Personality Disorder (C) is marked by a disregard for others' rights, lack of empathy, and impulsivity.
* Narcissistic Personality Disorder (D) is characterized by grandiosity, need for admiration, and a lack of empathy.
* Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (E) is a residual category for personality disorders that do not meet the criteria for a specific disorder.

"A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by the police. He was found unconscious and covered in bruises outside of a local bar. The patient has a past medical history of polysubstance abuse, depression, multiple suicide attempts, neuropathic pain, and schizophrenia. As part of the patient’s initial workup, a head CT is performed which is unremarkable, and an arterial blood gas is performed as seen below:

pH: 7.29
PaCO2: 95 mm Hg
PaO2: 70 mm Hg
Bicarbonate: 24 mEq/L

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s current presentation?",E,"The correct answer is B. Amitriptyline.

Here's why:

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a mixed acid-base disorder, with a pH of 7.29 indicating acidosis. The elevated PaCO2 (95 mm Hg) suggests respiratory acidosis, while the bicarbonate level of 24 mEq/L indicates a metabolic component to the acidosis.

Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is known to cause respiratory depression, which can lead to hypercapnia (elevated PaCO2) and respiratory acidosis. Additionally, amitriptyline can also cause anticholinergic effects, which can further contribute to respiratory depression.

The patient's history of depression and suicide attempts makes amitriptyline a plausible culprit. While the patient's history of polysubstance abuse and schizophrenia cannot be ignored, the ABG results are more consistent with amitriptyline toxicity.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

A. Alcohol: While alcohol can cause respiratory depression, it is less likely to cause the mixed acid-base disorder seen in this patient.

C. Cocaine: Cocaine can cause respiratory depression, but it is more likely to cause a metabolic acidosis due to its sympathomimetic effects, rather than a mixed acid-base disorder.

D. Ethylene glycol: Ethylene glycol toxicity typically causes a severe metabolic acidosis with a low bicarbonate level, which is not seen in this patient.

E. Heroin: Heroin can cause respiratory depression, but it is less likely to cause the mixed acid-base disorder seen in this patient.

In summary, the patient's ABG results and medical history make amitriptyline toxicity the most likely etiology of their current presentation.",Success
"A 3-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents for an acute arm injury. The mother reports that they were walking in the park and the patient’s dad was swinging the patient in the air by her arms. The dad reports he then heard a click and the patient immediately began to cry. On examination, the patient is holding her right forearm in a pronated position and her elbow slightly flexed. Pain is localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow. She refuses to use the affected limb. She does allow passive flexion and extension with full range of motion but supination is limited and causes pain. Which of the following is the next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is E. Supination then maximal extension.

This patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a nursemaid's elbow, also known as a pulled elbow or subluxation of the radial head. This is a common injury in young children, typically occurring when the forearm is pulled or jerked, causing the radial head to partially dislocate from the annular ligament.

The next step in management is to perform a reduction maneuver to relocate the radial head. The recommended technique is to supinate the forearm and then maximally extend the elbow. This can be done gently but firmly, and often results in a palpable ""click"" as the radial head reduces back into place.

Immobilization (Option A) may be necessary after reduction, but it is not the next step in management. Moderate flexion then hyperpronation (Option B) is not a recommended technique for reducing a nursemaid's elbow. Open reduction (Option C) is not necessary for a nursemaid's elbow, as it can usually be reduced with a simple manipulation. Radiograph (Option D) may be obtained to rule out other injuries, but it is not the next step in management, as the diagnosis can often be made clinically.

It's worth noting that after reduction, the child should be monitored for a few minutes to ensure they are using their arm normally and not experiencing any further pain or discomfort. If the child continues to experience symptoms or if the reduction is unsuccessful, further evaluation and management may be necessary.",Success
A 40-year-old male presents to your office complaining that he is too weak to climb stairs or brush his hair. He denies any headaches or change in vision. A muscle biopsy reveals CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,D,"The correct answer is D. Polymyositis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms of weakness, particularly in proximal muscles (difficulty climbing stairs and brushing hair), are consistent with an inflammatory myopathy. The muscle biopsy result showing CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium is a hallmark feature of polymyositis.

Polymyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy characterized by proximal muscle weakness, often with elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and inflammatory cell infiltrates in muscle tissue. The CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium is a characteristic finding in polymyositis.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

A. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease that can cause muscle weakness, but it is not typically characterized by CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in muscle tissue.

B. Scleroderma is a connective tissue disease that can cause muscle weakness, but it is more commonly associated with skin thickening and fibrosis.

C. Polymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory condition that causes muscle pain and stiffness, but it is typically seen in older adults and is not characterized by CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in muscle tissue.

E. Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy that can cause muscle weakness, but it is typically associated with characteristic skin rashes, such as a heliotrope rash or Gottron's papules, which are not mentioned in this patient's presentation.

In summary, the combination of proximal muscle weakness and CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium on muscle biopsy makes polymyositis the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 6-month-old boy presents to his pediatrician for a wellness examination. The mother reports that her child has difficulty rolling from his back to his front and sitting unsupported. The patient is able to smile and furrow his brow normally, but she has noticed that he has a weak cry and suck. He was born at 38 weeks gestation via a spontaneous vaginal delivery without any complications. The mother said that the patient appeared ""normal"" until the past few weeks. On physical exam, his extraocular muscle movements are intact, and a symmetric smile is seen. He has symmetric flaccid weakness of both his upper and lower extremities. He also has a bell-shaped chest. Deep tendon reflexes are diminished. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is D. Impaired acetylcholine release.

The patient's symptoms, including a weak cry and suck, symmetric flaccid weakness of both upper and lower extremities, and diminished deep tendon reflexes, are consistent with a diagnosis of infantile botulism. Infantile botulism is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition caused by the ingestion of spores of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which produces a toxin that impairs the release of acetylcholine from nerve terminals.

The patient's normal extraocular muscle movements and symmetric smile rule out anterior horn cell degeneration (Option A), which would affect the cranial nerves and facial muscles. Axonal demyelination (Option B) would not typically present with a weak cry and suck, and would more likely cause sensory deficits. Decreased acetylcholine receptor density (Option C) is seen in myasthenia gravis, which would present with fatigable weakness, not symmetric flaccid weakness. Myonecrosis (Option E) is a condition characterized by muscle death, which would not cause the patient's symptoms.

Infantile botulism is often diagnosed based on the patient's symptoms and a history of ingestion of honey or other contaminated foods, which can contain C. botulinum spores. Treatment typically involves supportive care, such as mechanical ventilation and nutritional support, as well as administration of botulism immune globulin.",Success
"A 6-day-old male newborn is brought to the physician because he has become increasingly irritable and restless over the past 2 days. During this period, he has had 12 bowel movements. He feeds 10 to 12 times a day. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation and weighed 1800 g (3 lb 15 oz); he currently weighs 1700 g (3 lb 12 oz). His mother has Graves' disease and received propylthiouracil during the last trimester of pregnancy. She has a history of intravenous heroin use. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 180/min, and respirations are 50/min. Examination shows mild diaphoresis and a firm 2-cm midline neck swelling. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is C. Potassium iodide therapy.

This newborn's symptoms, such as irritability, restlessness, and increased bowel movements, are consistent with neonatal thyrotoxicosis. The presence of a firm 2-cm midline neck swelling suggests an enlarged thyroid gland, which further supports this diagnosis. The mother's history of Graves' disease and treatment with propylthiouracil during pregnancy increases the risk of neonatal thyrotoxicosis.

Potassium iodide therapy is the most appropriate next step in management because it can help reduce the production of thyroid hormones and alleviate symptoms. This is a common treatment approach for neonatal thyrotoxicosis.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Methimazole and propranolol therapy are typically used to treat maternal Graves' disease, not neonatal thyrotoxicosis.

B. Digoxin and furosemide therapy are used to treat heart failure, which is not the primary concern in this scenario.

D. Naloxone therapy is used to treat opioid overdose, which is not relevant to this case, despite the mother's history of heroin use.

E. Calcium gluconate therapy is used to treat hypocalcemia, which is not a primary concern in this scenario.

It's essential to note that a thorough evaluation, including laboratory tests (e.g., thyroid function tests) and imaging studies (e.g., ultrasound), should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of neonatal thyrotoxicosis before initiating treatment.",Success
"A previously healthy 29-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of burning with urination for several days. He has also had pain in the right ankle for 3 days and pain and swelling in the left knee for 1 day. Two weeks ago, he had several days of fever and bloody diarrhea, for which he was treated with antibiotics. Examination shows a small left knee effusion and bilateral conjunctival injection. Which of the following is the most likely additional finding in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with reactive arthritis (ReA), a type of inflammatory arthritis that occurs in response to an infection, often gastrointestinal or genitourinary. The patient's history of bloody diarrhea and treatment with antibiotics two weeks prior to the onset of joint symptoms suggests a possible triggering event.

Reactive arthritis is characterized by a triad of symptoms: arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis. The patient's symptoms of burning with urination, pain and swelling in the left knee, and bilateral conjunctival injection are consistent with this triad.

Tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon (option D) is a common finding in reactive arthritis, particularly in the heel and Achilles tendon. This is due to enthesitis, inflammation at the site of tendon or ligament insertion into bone.

The other options are not directly related to reactive arthritis:

A. Circular erythematous rash with central clearing is more characteristic of Lyme disease or erythema migrans.

B. Pain on passive extension of the fingers is more consistent with inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

C. Palpable mass in the right lower quadrant could be related to various conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease or an abscess, but is not a typical finding in reactive arthritis.

E. Nontender subcutaneous nodules over the olecranon are more characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory conditions.

Therefore, option D, tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon, is the most likely additional finding in this patient with reactive arthritis.",Success
"A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a painless lump on her neck for 3 months that has increased in size. She appears healthy. Examination shows a 2.5-cm (1-in) firm, irregular swelling on the left side of the neck that moves with swallowing. There is painless cervical lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound of the neck shows a solitary left lobe thyroid mass with increased vascularity and hyperechogenic punctate regions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy is scheduled for the following week. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a thyroid nodule, which is a common presentation of thyroid cancer.
* The ultrasound features described, such as increased vascularity and hyperechogenic punctate regions, are characteristic of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).
* PTC is the most common type of thyroid cancer, accounting for approximately 80% of all thyroid cancer cases.
* The presence of painless cervical lymphadenopathy also supports the diagnosis of PTC, as it often metastasizes to cervical lymph nodes.
* Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a common diagnostic tool for thyroid nodules, and the results will likely confirm the diagnosis of PTC.

The other options are less likely based on the given information:

* A. Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid is less common than PTC and often presents with a more aggressive clinical course.
* B. Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is a neuroendocrine tumor that typically presents with a more aggressive clinical course and is often associated with a family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome.
* C. Hürthle cell carcinoma of the thyroid is a rare type of thyroid cancer that typically presents with a more aggressive clinical course and is often associated with a larger tumor size.
* E. Anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid is a highly aggressive and rare type of thyroid cancer that typically presents with a more advanced clinical stage and is often associated with a poor prognosis.

It's essential to note that a definitive diagnosis can only be made after the FNAB results are available. However, based on the given information, papillary carcinoma of the thyroid is the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 34-year-old man currently staying at an addiction center presents to the staff psychiatrist with diarrhea and painful muscle cramps. He has been discontinuing heroin over the last month as part of his treatment plan. He is HIV positive, hepatitis B (HBV) positive, and was recently treated for an infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. He reports pain over his abdomen, knees, and shoulder. To comprehensively treat these symptoms, which of the following would be the best therapy?",A,"The correct answer is A. Methadone.

The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and painful muscle cramps are likely related to opioid withdrawal, as he has been discontinuing heroin as part of his treatment plan. Methadone is a long-acting opioid agonist that can be used to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms. It is commonly used in medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder.

Methadone can help alleviate the patient's symptoms of diarrhea and muscle cramps by reducing the severity of opioid withdrawal. Additionally, methadone has been shown to be effective in reducing cravings and preventing relapse in individuals with opioid use disorder.

The other options are not the best therapy for the patient's symptoms:

B. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can precipitate withdrawal in individuals physically dependent on opioids. It is not indicated for the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms.

C. Alvimopan is a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist that is used to treat opioid-induced constipation. While it may help with the patient's constipation, it is not indicated for the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms.

D. Morphine is a short-acting opioid agonist that can exacerbate opioid withdrawal symptoms if used inappropriately. It is not the best choice for managing opioid withdrawal symptoms.

E. Loperamide is an antidiarrheal medication that may help with the patient's diarrhea, but it does not address the underlying opioid withdrawal symptoms.

It's worth noting that the patient's HIV and HBV status, as well as his recent infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, do not directly impact the treatment of his opioid withdrawal symptoms. However, it's essential to consider these comorbidities when developing a comprehensive treatment plan.",Success
"A 26-year-old man presents to his physician with a history of diarrhea and vomiting for the past 24 hours. On physical examination, his temperature is 36.9ºC (98.4ºF), pulse rate is 110/min, blood pressure is 102/74 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 16/min. A resident working under the physician plots a Darrow-Yannet diagram for the patient. The diagram is shown in the picture where the green dotted line represents the new fluid status. Which of the following is most likely to show increased secretion in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is E. Vasoactive intestinal peptide.

The Darrow-Yannet diagram provided suggests that the patient is experiencing a state of dehydration with a contraction of the extracellular fluid compartment, as indicated by the green dotted line. This is consistent with the patient's symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a hormone that stimulates the secretion of water and electrolytes in the intestine, leading to increased intestinal secretion and diarrhea. In this patient, the increased secretion of VIP is likely contributing to the diarrhea and dehydration.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a hormone that is released in response to increased blood pressure and volume overload, not dehydration.

B. Bradykinin is a peptide that causes blood vessels to dilate and is involved in the inflammatory response, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the Darrow-Yannet diagram.

C. Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells in response to hypoxia, but it is not related to the patient's symptoms or the Darrow-Yannet diagram.

D. Renin is an enzyme involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which regulates blood pressure and electrolyte balance. While renin levels may be elevated in response to dehydration, it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the Darrow-Yannet diagram.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the Darrow-Yannet diagram, the most likely hormone to show increased secretion is vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP).",Success
"A 28-year-old female comes to the physician’s office with a complaint of episodic chest pain. She describes the pain as squeezing and tightness in her chest. This pain has been happening every few days for 3 months. She says there is no association of the pain with food or exercise. She is able to climb up to her fourth floor apartment daily without issue. Her only past medical history is migraines for which she takes appropriate medication. Here temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. She has no known family history. The patient is not in pain on presentation and EKG in the office is normal. 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely. The mechanism of this patient’s chest pain is most similar to the mechanism behind which of the following?",A,"The correct answer is A. Raynaud's phenomenon.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the episodic chest pain with squeezing and tightness, and the 24-hour ECG monitoring showing transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely, suggest a diagnosis of Prinzmetal's angina. Prinzmetal's angina is a type of angina that occurs at rest, often in young women, and is caused by coronary artery vasospasm. The mechanism of Prinzmetal's angina is similar to Raynaud's phenomenon, which is a condition characterized by vasospasm of the digital arteries in response to cold or stress, leading to discoloration and pain in the fingers.

The other options are not directly related to the mechanism of the patient's chest pain:

B. Myocardial infarction is a condition where there is damage to the heart muscle due to lack of blood flow, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and ECG findings.

C. Aortic dissection is a condition where there is a tear in the lining of the aorta, which is not related to the patient's symptoms and ECG findings.

D. Costochondritis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone, which would not cause ST elevations on ECG.

E. Dysphagia is a symptom of difficulty swallowing, which is not related to the patient's chest pain symptoms.

It's worth noting that the patient's normal EKG in the office and the lack of association with exercise or food suggest that the patient's symptoms are not related to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. The diagnosis of Prinzmetal's angina would require further evaluation, including coronary angiography or other diagnostic tests.",Success
"A 22-year-old gravida 1 presents to her physician at 15 weeks gestation for a prenatal appointment. She complains of a rash involving her chest, face, and arms, a watery nasal discharge, and mild bilateral knee pain. She has had these symptoms for about 5 days. The symptoms do not seem to bother her too much, but she is concerned for the baby. She had contact with her younger sister, who also had a rash and was diagnosed with rubella infection about 10 days ago at a family gathering. She cannot confirm her vaccination history. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 89/min; respiratory rate, 12/min; and temperature, 37.6℃ (99.7℉). Examination shows a moderately dense maculopapular lacy rash spread over the patient’s trunk, extremities, and face. No lymph node, liver, or spleen enlargement is noted. The knee joints appear normal.
Serology performed 1 year ago Current serology
Rubella IgM - negative Rubella IgM - negative
Rubella IgG - 1:128 Rubella IgG - 1:64
Rubella IgG avidity - high Rubella IgG avidity - high
What is the proper next step in the management of this woman?",D,"The correct answer is A. Reassure and recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a viral infection, and her exposure to her sister with rubella infection raises concerns. However, the serology results are crucial in guiding management.

The patient's previous serology results (1 year ago) show a positive rubella IgG with high avidity, indicating past infection or immunization. The current serology results, which are negative for rubella IgM and show a decreased rubella IgG titer (1:64), suggest that the patient is immune to rubella and has not recently been infected.

Given the patient's immunity to rubella, the risk of fetal infection is minimal. Therefore, there is no indication for pregnancy termination (option B) or invasive testing such as chorionic villus sampling (option C).

While the patient's symptoms could be consistent with parvovirus B19 infection, there is no specific indication to test for this virus (option D) based on the provided information.

Rubella virus PCR (option E) is not necessary, as the patient's serology results have already confirmed her immune status.

Reassuring the patient and recommending vaccination against rubella postpartum (option A) is the proper next step, as she is already immune and the vaccine is contraindicated during pregnancy.",Success
"A 20-year-old woman presents with vaginal discharge, pruritus, and painful micturition for the past 5 days.

Speculum examination reveals vaginal erythema with a profuse, greenish-yellow, purulent, malodorous discharge. The vaginal pH is 5.5. Vaginal swab and urine samples are obtained for microscopy and culture, and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient based on her presentation?",D,"The correct answer is D. Trichomonal vaginitis.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as vaginal discharge, pruritus, and painful micturition, are consistent with a vaginal infection.
* The speculum examination reveals vaginal erythema with a profuse, greenish-yellow, purulent, and malodorous discharge, which is characteristic of trichomonal vaginitis.
* The vaginal pH of 5.5 is also consistent with trichomonal vaginitis, as Trichomonas vaginalis thrives in an alkaline environment.
* While the patient's symptoms could also be consistent with other vaginal infections, such as bacterial vaginosis (BV), the presence of a greenish-yellow, purulent discharge is more suggestive of trichomonal vaginitis. BV typically presents with a thin, white or gray discharge.
* Urinary tract infection (UTI) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, which are primarily vaginal in nature. UTI would typically present with symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, and urgency, which are not mentioned in this scenario.
* Candida vaginitis is also unlikely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Candida typically presents with a thick, white, cottage-cheese-like discharge, and the patient's vaginal pH is not consistent with candida infection.
* Chlamydia infection is a possibility, but it typically presents with a mucopurulent cervicitis, which is not mentioned in this scenario. Chlamydia infection would also require further testing, such as a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), to confirm the diagnosis.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, trichomonal vaginitis is the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 47-year-old female undergoes a thyroidectomy for treatment of Graves' disease. Post-operatively, she reports a hoarse voice and difficulty speaking. You suspect that this is likely a complication of her recent surgery. What is the embryologic origin of the damaged nerve that is most likely causing this patient's hoarseness?",E,"The correct answer is E. 6th pharyngeal arch.

The patient's symptoms of hoarseness and difficulty speaking suggest damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is responsible for controlling the muscles of the larynx and vocal cords. The recurrent laryngeal nerve is derived from the 6th pharyngeal arch.

During thyroid surgery, the recurrent laryngeal nerve is at risk of injury, which can result in hoarseness, vocal cord paralysis, or weakness. The nerve's proximity to the thyroid gland and its course near the ligament of Berry make it vulnerable to damage during surgical dissection.

The other options are not correct because:

A. The 1st pharyngeal arch gives rise to the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, which is not related to the patient's symptoms.

B. The 2nd pharyngeal arch contributes to the formation of the facial nerve, which is not involved in this patient's presentation.

C. The 3rd pharyngeal arch forms the glossopharyngeal nerve, which is not responsible for controlling the vocal cords or laryngeal muscles.

D. The 4th pharyngeal arch gives rise to the superior laryngeal nerve, which is also not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is E. 6th pharyngeal arch, as the recurrent laryngeal nerve is derived from this arch and is the most likely cause of the patient's hoarseness and difficulty speaking.",Success
"A 15-year-old boy with poorly controlled asthma presents to the emergency room complaining of severe shortness of breath. His mother reports that he had trouble breathing soon after he started playing soccer with some friends and was unable to use his inhaler as it was empty. His family history is notable for emphysema in his paternal uncle and cirrhosis in his maternal grandfather. The child’s temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, respirations are 28/min, and oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. Physical examination demonstrates wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields. The child is started on supplemental oxygen and a nebulized bronchodilator. Which of the following is a downstream effect of this medication?",E,"The correct answer is E. Increased adenylate cyclase activity.

The nebulized bronchodilator used to treat the patient's asthma is likely a beta-2 agonist, such as albuterol. Beta-2 agonists work by binding to beta-2 receptors in the lungs, which activates adenylate cyclase, an enzyme that converts ATP into cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased cAMP levels lead to relaxation of airway smooth muscle, bronchodilation, and improved airflow.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Decreased leukotriene activity: Leukotrienes are pro-inflammatory mediators that contribute to bronchoconstriction. While leukotriene modifiers are used to treat asthma, they are not the downstream effect of beta-2 agonists.

B. Prevention of mast cell degranulation: Mast cell stabilization is a mechanism of action for medications like cromolyn, not beta-2 agonists.

C. Activation of muscarinic receptors: Muscarinic receptors are actually blocked by anticholinergic medications, such as ipratropium, which is used to treat COPD, not asthma. Beta-2 agonists do not activate muscarinic receptors.

D. Decreased phosphodiesterase activity: Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as theophylline, are a different class of medications that work by increasing cAMP levels. While they have a similar effect to beta-2 agonists, they do not work through the same mechanism.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), recommend the use of beta-2 agonists as quick-relief medications for asthma exacerbations.",Success

Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 8 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 90 μm3
Leukocyte count 3,000/mm3
Platelet count 85,000/mm3
Peripheral blood smear shows small lymphocytes with cell membrane projections. Bone marrow aspiration is unsuccessful. Cell immunophenotyping is positive for CD25. Which of the following is the most effective pharmacotherapy at this time?",A,"The correct answer is A. Cladribine.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with hairy cell leukemia (HCL), a rare type of blood cancer. The presence of small lymphocytes with cell membrane projections on the peripheral blood smear, known as ""hairy cells,"" and the positive immunophenotyping for CD25 support this diagnosis.

Cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) is a purine nucleoside analog that is specifically approved for the treatment of HCL. It has been shown to be highly effective in inducing complete remissions in patients with HCL, with response rates ranging from 80% to 90%. Cladribine is considered the first-line treatment for HCL and is often used as a single agent.

Fludarabine (option B) is also a purine nucleoside analog, but it is not specifically approved for HCL. While it may be used in some cases, it is not as effective as cladribine in treating HCL.

Imatinib (option C) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat certain types of leukemia, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but it is not effective in HCL.

Prednisone (option D) is a corticosteroid that may be used to treat some symptoms associated with HCL, such as fatigue or anemia, but it is not a primary treatment for the disease.

Thalidomide (option E) is an immunomodulatory agent used to treat multiple myeloma and other conditions, but it is not typically used to treat HCL.

Which of the following is the best diagnostic test to guide current therapy in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Urine antigen test.

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila. The patient's presentation with fever, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and confusion is consistent with this diagnosis. The laboratory results, including the patient's electrolyte imbalance, elevated leukocyte count, and normal platelet count, also support this diagnosis.

The urine antigen test is a rapid and sensitive test that can detect the presence of Legionella antigens in the urine. It is a useful diagnostic tool for guiding therapy, as it can provide a quick diagnosis and help direct antibiotic treatment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend using the urine antigen test as the primary diagnostic test for Legionnaires' disease.

While the other options may be useful in the diagnosis and management of the patient, they are not the best diagnostic test to guide current therapy in this patient.

A. Blood cultures may be useful in diagnosing bacteremia, but they are not specific for Legionnaires' disease and may take several days to yield results.

B. Chest radiography can help identify the presence of pneumonia, but it is not specific for Legionnaires' disease and may not provide a definitive diagnosis.

C. Lung biopsy is an invasive procedure that is not necessary for the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease and may carry risks for the patient.

D. Sputum culture can be used to diagnose Legionnaires' disease, but it may take several days to yield results and may not be as sensitive as the urine antigen test.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Pseudomonas keratitis.

The patient's symptoms, including progressive pain and blurry vision in one eye, especially with a history of contact lens wear, suggest a diagnosis of microbial keratitis. The photograph of the right eye (not provided in this text, but assumed to show a characteristic appearance) likely shows a central ulcer with a yellowish discharge and a ring-shaped infiltrate, which is consistent with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection.

Pseudomonas keratitis is a serious and potentially vision-threatening infection that can occur in contact lens wearers, especially if they do not follow proper hygiene and disinfection procedures. The patient's occupation as a kindergarten teacher and use of inhaled salbutamol for asthma are not directly related to the diagnosis.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

A. Angle-closure glaucoma typically presents with a sudden onset of severe eye pain, nausea, and vomiting, and is often associated with a red eye. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with a corneal infection.

B. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis is a viral conjunctivitis that typically causes a bilateral, follicular conjunctivitis with a gritty sensation, but not a unilateral, central ulcer.

C. Herpes simplex keratitis can cause a unilateral, central ulcer, but it is usually associated with a history of previous episodes, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a bacterial infection.

D. Herpes zoster keratitis is a viral infection that typically affects older adults and causes a unilateral, painful rash in a dermatomal distribution, often with a history of shingles. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Hemoglobin 12.9 mg/dL
Leukocyte count 9,300/mm3
Platelet count 167,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 43 mm/hr
Periodic acid-Schiff and silver methenamine Positive
Acid-fast stain Negative
 Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Valley fever.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as chronic cough, aching joints, and malaise, are consistent with a fungal infection. The chest X-ray and CT findings, including consolidation, pleural effusion, and hilar adenopathy, suggest an infectious process. The lung biopsy results, showing necrotic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores, are characteristic of coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley fever.

The patient's history of hiking in the desert near Phoenix, Arizona, is a strong risk factor for Valley fever, as Coccidioides fungi are endemic to the southwestern United States. The laboratory results, including a positive periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and silver methenamine stain, support this diagnosis. The negative acid-fast stain rules out mycobacterial infections.

While the other options are fungal infections, they do not fit the patient's presentation and laboratory results as well as Valley fever:

A. Histoplasmosis typically affects the lungs and can cause a similar presentation, but it is more common in the Midwest and Northeast United States, and the biopsy findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

B. Mycetoma is a fungal infection that typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissues, causing a characteristic ""fungus ball"" or ""grain"" in the tissue. It is not typically associated with pulmonary symptoms or the biopsy findings seen in this case.

C. Blastomycosis is a fungal infection that can cause pulmonary symptoms, but it is more common in the southeastern United States and the biopsy findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

E. Chromomycosis is a fungal infection that typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissues, causing a chronic, slowly progressing lesion. It is not typically associated with pulmonary symptoms or the biopsy findings seen in this case.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is Valley fever (Coccidioidomycosis).",Success
"A 22-year-old man with sickle cell disease is brought to the emergency room for acute onset facial asymmetry and severe pain. He was in school when his teacher noted a drooping of his left face. His temperature is 99.9°F (37.7°C), blood pressure is 122/89 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for facial asymmetry and 4/5 strength in the patient's upper and lower extremity. A CT scan of the head does not demonstrate an intracranial bleed. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Exchange transfusion.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the acute onset of facial asymmetry, suggest a diagnosis of stroke or cerebral vasculopathy, which is a common complication of sickle cell disease. The CT scan ruling out an intracranial bleed supports this diagnosis.

Exchange transfusion is the most appropriate treatment for this patient because it has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with sickle cell disease and acute stroke. Exchange transfusion involves replacing the patient's sickled red blood cells with normal red blood cells, which helps to reduce the risk of further ischemic injury and improves blood flow to the affected area.

Alteplase (A) is a thrombolytic agent used to treat acute ischemic stroke, but it is not typically used in patients with sickle cell disease, as they are at high risk for bleeding complications.

Heparin (C) is an anticoagulant that may be used to prevent further thrombosis, but it is not the primary treatment for acute stroke in sickle cell disease.

Hydroxyurea (D) is a medication used to prevent sickling of red blood cells and reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises, but it is not a treatment for acute stroke.

Warfarin (E) is an oral anticoagulant used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, but it is not indicated in this scenario.

The American Society of Hematology and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommend exchange transfusion as the primary treatment for acute stroke in patients with sickle cell disease.",Success
"A 3-month-old girl is brought to the physician because of a productive cough for 5 days. Over the past month, she has had several episodes of watery stools. She is exclusively breastfed every 3–4 hours for 15–20 minutes. She was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation at home and has not yet been evaluated by a physician. The mother reports that her child is not gaining weight. The mother had no prenatal care. The infant is at the 5th percentile for height and weight. The infant has not received any immunizations. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 155/min, respirations are 45/min, and blood pressure is 88/50 mm Hg. Oral examination shows white plaques covering the tongue and the palate. Rales are heard bilaterally on cardiopulmonary examination. Cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is C. Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test.

The patient's symptoms, including a productive cough, watery stools, failure to thrive, and oral examination findings of white plaques on the tongue and palate, suggest congenital syphilis. The presence of cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy further supports this diagnosis.

The fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test is a specific test for syphilis that detects antibodies against Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis. It is the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis of congenital syphilis in this patient.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Karyotyping of infant's chromosomes: This test is used to diagnose chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome, but it is not relevant to the diagnosis of congenital syphilis.

B. DNA test for CFTR mutation: This test is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

D. Polymerase chain reaction for viral genes: While PCR can be used to diagnose viral infections, it is not specific to congenital syphilis.

E. T-cell receptor excision circle analysis: This test is used to diagnose severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the diagnosis of congenital syphilis is based on a combination of clinical and laboratory findings, including the FTA-ABS test.",Success
"A 30-year-old primigravid woman at 22 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department by her husband for lethargy, nausea, and vomiting for 4 days. This morning she became drowsy. She returned from a business trip to Sudan 3 weeks ago. She denies eating any seafood while traveling. Medications include iron supplements and a multivitamin. Her immunizations are up-to-date and she has never received blood products. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 122/76 mm Hg. She is oriented to person and place. Examination shows jaundice and mild asterixis. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 22-week gestation. Laboratory studies show:

Anti-nuclear antibody negative
Anti-smooth muscle antibody negative
Anti-CMV antibody negative
Anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibody negative
An ELISA for HIV is negative. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""",E,"The correct answer is E. Anti-HEV IgM.

Let's break down the patient's presentation and laboratory results to justify this choice:

* The patient is a 30-year-old primigravid woman at 22 weeks' gestation who recently traveled to Sudan, which is an endemic area for hepatitis E virus (HEV).
* She presents with lethargy, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice, which are common symptoms of acute hepatitis.
* Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase, indicating liver damage and cholestasis.
* The patient's prothrombin time is prolonged, which is consistent with liver dysfunction.
* The absence of anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-CMV antibody, and anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibody suggests that autoimmune hepatitis and viral hepatitis A, B, and C are less likely.
* The patient's history of travel to Sudan and the absence of seafood consumption make hepatitis E virus (HEV) a strong possibility.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a common cause of acute hepatitis in pregnant women, particularly in endemic areas. The diagnosis of HEV is typically made by detecting anti-HEV IgM antibodies in the serum, which is a marker of acute infection.

Option A, HBsAg, is a marker for hepatitis B virus infection, which is not supported by the patient's history and laboratory results.

Option B, Anti-HAV IgG, is a marker for past hepatitis A virus infection, which is not consistent with the patient's acute presentation.

Option C, HCV RNA, is a marker for hepatitis C virus infection, which is not supported by the patient's history and laboratory results.

Option D, Anti-HCV IgG, is a marker for past hepatitis C virus infection, which is not consistent with the patient's acute presentation.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is hepatitis E virus infection, which can be confirmed by detecting anti-HEV IgM antibodies in the serum.",Success
"A 36-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of multiple episodes of nonbilious emesis for 3 days. The vomitus consists of undigested food and he has also had dark brown emesis twice today. He has been having early satiety during this period. He has had progressive severe episodic epigastric pain and dyspepsia for the past week. The pain is partially relieved with food or over-the-counter antacids, but worsens at night and several hours after eating. He has also had a weight gain of 2 kg (4.4 lbs) during this period. His father underwent surgery for colon cancer 3 years ago. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the last 15 years. He drinks two to three beers daily. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 106/min and blood pressure is 108/68 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The abdomen is mildly tender to palpation in the left upper quadrant; there is a tympanitic mass in the epigastrium. A succussion splash is heard with a stethoscope when the patient is rocked back and forth at the hips. Bowel sounds are reduced. Rectal examination is unremarkable. Test of the stool for occult blood is positive. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:

Glucose 77 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.4 mg/dL
Which of the following is the underlying cause of this patient's vomiting?""",A,"The correct answer is D. Scarring and fibrosis.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of pyloric stenosis, which is a narrowing of the pyloric canal that connects the stomach to the small intestine. The symptoms of nonbilious vomiting, early satiety, and epigastric pain that worsens at night and several hours after eating are consistent with gastric outlet obstruction. The presence of a tympanitic mass in the epigastrium and a succussion splash heard with a stethoscope when the patient is rocked back and forth at the hips further support this diagnosis.

The underlying cause of pyloric stenosis in this patient is likely scarring and fibrosis due to chronic gastritis, which is a common complication of Helicobacter pylori infection. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption increases his risk of developing gastritis. The presence of occult blood in the stool also suggests mucosal damage and inflammation.

Option A, inflammation and edema, may contribute to the patient's symptoms, but it is not the underlying cause of the vomiting. Option B, abnormal gastric rotation, is not a common cause of pyloric stenosis. Option C, neoplastic growth, is possible, but the patient's symptoms and examination findings are more consistent with a benign cause. Option E, walled-off pancreatic fluid collection, is not related to the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

His current medications include atorvastatin, enalapril, and hydrochlorothiazide. He appears pale and sweaty. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 25/min. Blood pressure is 107/72 mm Hg during expiration and 86/65 mm Hg during inspiration. Examination shows jugular venous distention and pitting edema below the knees. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?",D,"The correct answer is D. Accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition caused by the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space. The pericardial space is a sac that surrounds the heart, and when it becomes filled with fluid, it can compress the heart and prevent it from pumping effectively.

The patient's symptoms of worsening shortness of breath, chest pain that worsens with lying down or taking deep breaths, and a dry cough are all consistent with cardiac tamponade. The physical examination findings of jugular venous distention, pitting edema below the knees, and a drop in blood pressure during inspiration (pulsus paradoxus) are also characteristic of cardiac tamponade.

Option A, dilation of the atria and ventricles, may be seen in heart failure, but it is not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Option B, accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity, may cause shortness of breath, but it would not typically cause the physical examination findings seen in this patient, such as jugular venous distention and pulsus paradoxus.

Option C, occlusion of a coronary artery, may cause chest pain, but it would not typically cause the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as shortness of breath, jugular venous distention, and pulsus paradoxus.

Option E, fibrous thickening of the pericardium, may be seen in constrictive pericarditis, but it would not typically cause the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and pulsus paradoxus.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely cause of his findings is accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space, or cardiac tamponade.",Success
"A 70-year-old obese male presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath and cough of sudden onset. The patient states that his symptoms came on while he was sleeping. The patient has a past medical history of type II diabetes and is currently taking lisinopril, metformin, insulin, and fish oil. On physical exam, you note bipedal edema and jugular venous distention (JVD). An EKG and chest radiographs are obtained (Figures A and B). The patient is started on BIPAP and medical therapy and his symptoms improve rapidly. Lab values are as follows.

Serum:
Na+: 137 mEq/L
K+: 3.2 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
HCO3-: 31 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 120 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.9 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best explanation of this patient's current presentation?",B,"The correct answer is A. Furosemide.

Let's break down the patient's presentation and lab values to justify this choice:

1. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and cough, along with physical exam findings of bipedal edema and jugular venous distention (JVD), suggest congestive heart failure (CHF).
2. The EKG and chest radiographs (Figures A and B) are not provided, but based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam, it's likely that they show signs of CHF, such as cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, or atrial fibrillation.
3. The patient's lab values are significant for:
	* Hypokalemia (K+ 3.2 mEq/L): This is a key finding, as it suggests that the patient has been taking a diuretic, which is causing potassium loss.
	* Mild metabolic alkalosis (HCO3- 31 mEq/L): This is consistent with diuretic use, which can cause alkalosis due to potassium depletion and increased bicarbonate reabsorption in the kidneys.
	* Normal anion gap (Na+ - Cl- - HCO3- = 6, which is within normal limits): This rules out a significant metabolic acidosis.
4. Given the patient's history of hypertension and CHF, it's likely that the patient was taking a diuretic, such as furosemide, to manage his symptoms. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that can cause hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

The other options are not supported by the patient's presentation and lab values:

* B. Hydrochlorothiazide: While this diuretic can also cause hypokalemia, it's less likely to cause the degree of metabolic alkalosis seen in this patient.
* C. Renal tubular acidosis type I: This would typically present with a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is not seen in this patient.
* D. Renal tubular acidosis type II: This is a rare condition that would present with a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia, but it's unlikely given the patient's history and symptoms.
* E. Renal tubular acidosis type IV: This is a condition that typically presents with hyperkalemia, not hypokalemia, and is not consistent with the patient's lab values.

Therefore, the best explanation for this patient's current presentation is that they were taking furosemide, which caused hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, and exacerbated their underlying CHF.",Success
"A 23-year-old woman is seen by her primary care physician for fatigue. She says that she has always felt a little short of breath compared to her friends; however, she did not think that it was abnormal until she started trying a new exercise regimen. On physical exam, she is found to have mild conjunctival pallor and a peripheral blood smear is obtained showing echinocytes but no intracellular accumulations. Upon further questioning, she recalls that several relatives have had similar issues with fatigue and pallor in the past. Which of the following is true about the rate limiting enzyme of the biochemical pathway that is affected by this patient's most likely condition?",C,"The correct answer is B. It is stimulated by citrate.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the most likely condition is hereditary spherocytosis, a genetic disorder affecting the red blood cell membrane. The presence of echinocytes (abnormally shaped red blood cells) on the peripheral blood smear supports this diagnosis.

The biochemical pathway affected in hereditary spherocytosis is the pentose phosphate pathway, which is involved in the production of NADPH and glutathione. The rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway is phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1).

Citrate is an allosteric activator of PFK-1, which means it increases the enzyme's activity. This is because citrate is an indicator of high energy levels in the cell, and when energy levels are high, the cell can afford to divert glucose metabolism towards the pentose phosphate pathway to produce NADPH and glutathione.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. ATP is an inhibitor of PFK-1, not a stimulator.

C. Protein kinase A activity phosphorylates and inhibits PFK-2, which is a different enzyme involved in glycolysis, not the pentose phosphate pathway.

D. Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate is an inhibitor of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, an enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis, not the pentose phosphate pathway.

E. AMP is an activator of PFK-1, but it's not the correct answer in this case. Citrate is a more specific activator of PFK-1 in the context of the pentose phosphate pathway.",Success
"A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because she feels depressed, has difficulty sleeping, a poor appetite, and low concentration for the past 3 months. During this time, she has also had low energy and lost interest in playing the guitar. During high school, the patient went through similar episodes of low mood and poor sleep. At that time, she would repeatedly engage in binge eating and purging behavior, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. The physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should most be avoided in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Bupropion.

The patient's history of binge eating and purging behavior suggests a previous diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. Bupropion, an antidepressant, is contraindicated in patients with a history of eating disorders, particularly bulimia nervosa, due to the increased risk of seizures. This is stated in the FDA's black box warning for bupropion.

The other options are not contraindicated in this patient:

A. Duloxetine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that can be used to treat depression and is not specifically contraindicated in patients with a history of eating disorders.

B. Trazodone is a sedating antidepressant that can be used to treat depression and insomnia, and it is not contraindicated in patients with a history of eating disorders.

D. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant that can increase appetite and is sometimes used to treat depression in patients with a history of eating disorders.

E. Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that can be used to treat depression and is not specifically contraindicated in patients with a history of eating disorders.

He is at the 10th percentile for height and 3rd percentile for weight. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 126/min, and respirations are 35/min. Examination shows an erythematous scaly rash over his trunk and extremities. The white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa bleed when scraped. Inspiratory crackles are heard in the right lung base. An X-ray of the chest shows an infiltrate in the right lower lobe and an absent thymic shadow. Which of the following is the most likely definitive treatment for this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Hematopoietic cell transplantation.

This patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), a rare genetic disorder characterized by a defect in the development and function of T and B cells. The patient's history of recurrent infections, including otitis media and bronchiolitis, and the presence of an erythematous scaly rash, white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa that bleed when scraped (suggesting oral thrush), and an infiltrate in the right lower lobe on chest X-ray support this diagnosis.

The absent thymic shadow on chest X-ray is a key finding, as the thymus is responsible for T-cell development and is typically absent or hypoplastic in SCID patients.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the most likely definitive treatment for SCID. HCT involves the infusion of healthy stem cells from a donor into the patient, which can repopulate the immune system and restore immune function. This treatment has been shown to be effective in curing SCID, and it is recommended as the standard of care for patients with this condition.

The other options are not correct because:

* Interferon-γ therapy (B) is used to treat chronic granulomatous disease, not SCID.
* Intravenous immune globulin (C) may be used to provide temporary immune support, but it is not a definitive treatment for SCID.
* Leucovorin supplementation (D) is used to treat folate deficiency, which is not related to SCID.
* Thymic transplantation (E) is not a standard treatment for SCID, and HCT is the preferred treatment option.

It's worth noting that SCID is a medical emergency, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent severe infections and improve outcomes.",Success

Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?""",E,"The correct answer is D. Excess circulating thrombin.

The patient's symptoms, including bluish discolorations around the peripheral intravenous catheters and severe right leg pain, are consistent with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The laboratory results showing a low platelet count (48,000/mm3) and a normal prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time also support this diagnosis.

HIT is a complication of heparin therapy, which can occur in up to 5% of patients receiving unfractionated heparin. It is caused by the formation of antibodies against the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex, leading to platelet activation and thrombosis.

The excess circulating thrombin in HIT patients is due to the formation of thrombin in the presence of heparin, which can lead to the formation of thrombi and platelet consumption, resulting in thrombocytopenia.

Option A is incorrect because vitamin K-dependent clotting factors are not related to the patient's symptoms. Option B is incorrect because phagocytosis of autoantibody-opsonized platelets is a mechanism of immune thrombocytopenia, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Option C is incorrect because deficiency of von Willebrand factor is not related to the patient's symptoms. Option E is incorrect because autoantibody-mediated platelet activation is a mechanism of immune thrombocytopenia, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of receiving prophylactic unfractionated heparin and the development of thrombocytopenia and thrombotic symptoms are strong indicators of HIT. The diagnosis of HIT should be suspected in any patient who develops thrombocytopenia or thrombotic symptoms during or after heparin therapy.",Success
A 55-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B virus infection comes to the physician because of generalized fatigue and a 5.4 kg (12 lb) weight loss over the past 4 months. Physical examination shows hepatomegaly. Laboratory studies show an α-fetoprotein concentration of 380 ng/ml (N < 10 ng/mL). A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast shows a solitary mass in the left lobe of the liver that enhances in the arterial phase. Which of the following is the most likely underlying pathogenesis of this patient's current condition?,E,"The correct answer is E. Integration of foreign DNA into host genome.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, generalized fatigue, weight loss, hepatomegaly, and elevated α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels suggests a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The CT scan findings of a solitary mass in the left lobe of the liver that enhances in the arterial phase further support this diagnosis.

HBV is a known risk factor for HCC, and the integration of the HBV genome into the host genome is a key step in the development of HCC. This integration can lead to the disruption of normal cellular regulatory pathways, promoting the growth and proliferation of liver cells and ultimately resulting in cancer.

The other options are not directly related to the development of HCC in the context of HBV infection:

A. Overexpression of secretory hepatitis antigen is not a known mechanism of HCC development.

B. Intracellular accumulation of misfolded protein is more relevant to protein misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or amyloidosis.

C. Gain of function mutation of a proto-oncogene is a mechanism of cancer development, but it is not specific to HBV-related HCC.

D. Viral cytotoxin-induced cellular dysplasia is not a recognized mechanism of HCC development in the context of HBV infection.

Therefore, option E, integration of foreign DNA into host genome, is the most likely underlying pathogenesis of this patient's current condition.",Success

Physical exam is remarkable for petechiae and scattered ecchymoses on the patient's bilateral upper and lower extremities. Urine beta-HCG is negative. Laboratory results are as follows: Hgb 13.0 g/dL, WBCs 6,000/mL, platelets 95,000/mL, PT 13.2s, aPTT 30s. Peripheral blood smear shows normocytic, normochromic red blood cells and few platelets with no morphologic abnormalities. Which diagnostic study should be performed next?",D,"The correct answer is D. HIV and HCV testing.

Here's why:

The patient presents with increased menstrual bleeding, easy bruising, and bleeding from her gums, which suggests a bleeding disorder. The physical exam reveals petechiae and ecchymoses, indicating a platelet-related issue. The laboratory results show thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) with a normal PT and aPTT, which rules out a coagulation factor deficiency.

Given the patient's history of multiple sexual partners and no history of intravenous drug use, infectious causes of thrombocytopenia should be considered. HIV and HCV infections can cause thrombocytopenia, and testing for these viruses is a logical next step.

Option A is incorrect because while factor VIII levels and von Willebrand factor activity may be relevant in evaluating bleeding disorders, they are not the most likely cause of thrombocytopenia in this patient.

Option B is incorrect because vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies can cause anemia, but they are not typically associated with thrombocytopenia.

Option C is incorrect because ADAMTS13 activity is relevant in evaluating thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), which is not the most likely diagnosis in this patient given the lack of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear and the normal PT and aPTT.

Option E is incorrect because while a bone marrow aspiration may ultimately be necessary to evaluate the patient's thrombocytopenia, it is not the next logical step in the diagnostic workup.",Success
"A 6-year-old boy is brought in by his parents to a pediatrician’s office for persistent fever. His temperature has ranged from 38.6°C–39.5°C (101.5°F–103.1°F) over the past week. He was diagnosed with a gene defect on chromosome 7, which has caused dysfunction in a transmembrane protein. This defect has resulted in several hospitalizations for various respiratory infections. At the present time, he is struggling with a cough with thick purulent sputum. A sputum sample is sent for culture and the patient is started on vancomycin.The pediatrician tells the patient’s family that there is a collection of mucus in the respiratory tree which increases the patient's chances of future infections. He will have to undergo chest physiotherapy and they should report any signs of infection immediately to a medical professional. Which of the following pathogens will most likely infect this patient in adulthood?",B,"The correct answer is B. Pseudomonas.

The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that they have cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7. This mutation leads to abnormal transport of salt and water in the body, resulting in thick, sticky mucus that clogs the airways and digestive tract.

The patient's persistent fever, cough with thick purulent sputum, and history of recurrent respiratory infections are all consistent with CF. The pediatrician's mention of a collection of mucus in the respiratory tree and the need for chest physiotherapy further support this diagnosis.

In adults with CF, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common and significant pathogen that can cause chronic lung infections. It is often resistant to multiple antibiotics, making it a challenging infection to treat. In fact, P. aeruginosa is the most common bacterial pathogen isolated from the respiratory tract of adults with CF, and its presence is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

While Staphylococcus aureus can also cause respiratory infections in patients with CF, it is not as commonly associated with chronic lung infections in adults with CF as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Burkholderia cepacia complex is another pathogen that can infect patients with CF, but it is more commonly seen in a subset of patients with CF who have a more severe phenotype. Influenza is a viral pathogen that can cause respiratory infections in anyone, but it is not specifically associated with CF. Candida is a fungal pathogen that can cause infections in patients with CF, but it is not as commonly associated with respiratory infections as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",Success

She reports that he seems mildly upset during the episodes of regurgitation but usually settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. The patient’s mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of the regurgitation. She denies any diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. Her older son had a similar problem with vomiting that resolved around 12 months of age. Four weeks ago, the patient’s height and weight were in the 40th and 34th percentiles, respectively. His height and weight are now respectively in the 37th and 36th percentiles. On physical exam, the patient is cooing in his mother’s lap and smiles reciprocally with her. He lifts his head and shoulders off the examination table when placed in the supine position. His abdomen is soft, non-tender and non-distended. Bowel sounds are normoactive.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Reassurance and counseling on positioning.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms are consistent with physiologic reflux, which is a common and normal phenomenon in infants. The regurgitation of breastmilk through the nose and mouth, especially after feeds, is a classic presentation of reflux. The fact that the patient seems mildly upset during these episodes but settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards suggests that the reflux is not causing significant distress or discomfort.

The mother's attempt to limit the volume of each feed has already reduced the frequency of regurgitation, which further supports the diagnosis of physiologic reflux. The patient's growth parameters are also reassuring, with height and weight percentiles remaining stable.

In this scenario, the best next step is to reassure the mother and provide counseling on positioning techniques to help reduce the frequency and severity of reflux episodes. This may include suggestions such as:

* Burping the baby frequently during feeds
* Keeping the baby upright for 30 minutes after feeds
* Avoiding overfeeding or forcing the baby to finish a feed
* Using a wedge or inclined surface to elevate the baby's head and chest during sleep

There is no indication for initiating proton pump inhibitors (Option A) or obtaining an abdominal ultrasound (Option B) at this point, as the symptoms are not suggestive of pathologic reflux or other underlying conditions.

Modifying the mother's diet (Option D) is not necessary, as there is no evidence of a food allergy or intolerance. Switching to hydrolyzed formula (Option E) is also not indicated, as the patient is breastfed and there is no evidence of a milk protein allergy.

Reassurance and counseling on positioning (Option C) is the most appropriate next step in management, as it addresses the mother's concerns and provides guidance on how to manage the reflux symptoms.",Success
"A 27-year-old gentleman is brought into the ED after being stabbed in the back by a knife. In addition to the pain from the wound, he complains of weakness in his left leg. Upon physical examination you find that he has no other visible injuries; however, he has 2/5 strength in the left lower extremity. Complete neurologic exam also finds a deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity as well as a loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity. Which of the following lesions would result in the syndrome described?",D,"The correct answer is D. Left cord hemisection.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a lesion affecting the spinal cord. Specifically:

* Weakness in the left leg (2/5 strength) indicates a motor deficit.
* Deficits in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity suggest involvement of the dorsal columns, which transmit proprioceptive and tactile information.
* Loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right lower extremity indicates involvement of the spinothalamic tracts, which transmit pain and temperature information.

These findings are consistent with a Brown-Séquard syndrome, which is a rare but classic neurological syndrome resulting from a hemisection of the spinal cord. In this case, the lesion is on the left side of the spinal cord, resulting in:

* Ipsilateral (same side) motor weakness and proprioceptive deficits (left leg)
* Contralateral (opposite side) pain and temperature sensation deficits (right leg)

A left cord hemisection (Option D) would result in this specific pattern of deficits.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Anterior cord lesion: Would result in bilateral motor weakness and loss of pain and temperature sensation, but not the specific pattern of deficits seen in this patient.

B. Posterior cord lesion: Would result in bilateral proprioceptive deficits, but not the motor weakness and contralateral pain and temperature sensation deficits seen in this patient.

C. Right cord hemisection: Would result in a mirror image of the deficits seen in this patient, with right-sided motor weakness and proprioceptive deficits, and left-sided pain and temperature sensation deficits.

E. Complete cord transection: Would result in complete loss of motor and sensory function below the level of the lesion, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and examination findings.",Success
"A 58-year-old African American man presents for his yearly wellness visit. He says he has been unsuccessful at losing weight and would like help. His last colonoscopy was 8 years previously, which was normal. Past medical history is significant for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension. Current medications are isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine and aspirin 81 mg orally daily. He is also on CPAP to manage his OSA. The patient denies any history of smoking or recreational drug use and drinks 1 or 2 beers on weekends. Family history is significant for prostate cancer in his father and hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 in his mother. His vital signs include: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse 97/min, respiratory rate 16/min, blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. BMI is 30 kg/m2. Physical examination is unremarkable. Fasting blood glucose is 90 mg/dL. Which of the following preventative screening tests would be most appropriate for this patient at this time?",A,"The correct answer is C. HbA1C.

The patient's presentation and medical history indicate that he is at risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus, given his family history of diabetes and his current BMI of 30 kg/m2, which falls into the obese category. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends screening for diabetes in adults with a BMI ≥25 kg/m2 and at least one additional risk factor, such as a first-degree relative with diabetes.

Although the patient's fasting blood glucose is currently normal, the ADA recommends using a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test as a screening tool for diabetes, as it provides a more accurate assessment of average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months. An HbA1c level of 5.7% or higher is indicative of prediabetes, and a level of 6.5% or higher is diagnostic of diabetes.

The other options are not as relevant for this patient at this time:

A. PSA (prostate-specific antigen) screening is not recommended for average-risk men, and the patient's family history of prostate cancer does not necessarily warrant screening at this time.

B. Digital rectal exam is not a recommended screening test for prostate cancer, and the patient's family history does not warrant screening at this time.

D. Abdominal ultrasound is not a recommended screening test for this patient, as there is no indication of liver disease or other abdominal pathology.

E. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is not necessary at this time, as the patient's last colonoscopy was 8 years ago and was normal. The recommended interval for colon cancer screening is 10 years for average-risk individuals.

In summary, the most appropriate preventative screening test for this patient at this time is an HbA1C test to assess his risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus.",Success
"A 34-year-old patient is brought to the emergency room after a motor vehicle accident. An EKG shows sinus tachycardia and chest radiograph reveals an enlarged cardiac silhouette. While observing sinus tachycardia on the patient's telemetry, you note that the radial pulse cannot be palpated during inspiration. What should be the next step in management of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is D. Pericardial window.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and test results are consistent with cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition caused by fluid accumulation in the pericardial space, which compresses the heart and impairs its function. The signs and symptoms include:

* Enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest radiograph
* Sinus tachycardia
* Pulsus paradoxus, which is the inability to palpate the radial pulse during inspiration (as observed in this patient)

The next step in management is to perform a pericardial window, which is a surgical procedure to drain the pericardial fluid and relieve the compression on the heart. This is a critical intervention to restore cardiac function and prevent further deterioration.

The other options are not correct because:

A. IV Heparin is not indicated for cardiac tamponade, and it may even increase the risk of bleeding in this scenario.

B. Pericardiocentesis is a procedure to drain the pericardial fluid, but it's not the best option in this case because the patient requires a more definitive and immediate intervention.

C. Chest CT scan may be useful in diagnosing other conditions, but it's not the next step in managing cardiac tamponade.

E. Inserting a chest tube is not relevant to managing cardiac tamponade, as it's used to drain fluid or air from the pleural space, not the pericardial space.

It's essential to prioritize the patient's critical condition and perform a pericardial window to address the cardiac tamponade.",Success
"A previously healthy 60-year-old man comes to his physician because of progressively worsening shortness of breath for the past 2 months. He does not experience shortness of breath at rest. He also occasionally has a dry cough. He has not had fever, chills, or night sweats. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. He drinks a beer daily and occasionally more on weekends. He does not use illicit drugs. He is 183 cm (6 ft 0 in) tall and weighs 66 kg (145 lbs); BMI is 19.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 136/88 mm Hg. Lung auscultation reveals a prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing. Spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 62%, an FEV1 of 60% of predicted, and a total lung capacity of 125% of predicted. The diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO) is decreased. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath and dry cough, are consistent with COPD.
* The patient's history of smoking (40 years, 1 pack/day) is a significant risk factor for COPD.
* The physical examination findings, including prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing, are also consistent with COPD.
* The spirometry results show an FEV1:FVC ratio of 62%, which is below the normal range of 70-80%. This indicates airflow obstruction, which is a hallmark of COPD.
* The FEV1 of 60% of predicted is also consistent with moderate airflow obstruction, which is typical of COPD.
* The total lung capacity of 125% of predicted suggests hyperinflation, which is also consistent with COPD.
* The decreased diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO) may indicate emphysema, which is a component of COPD.

While the other options are possible, they are less likely based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and spirometry results:

* Interstitial lung disease (A) would typically present with a restrictive pattern on spirometry, which is not seen in this patient.
* Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (B) would typically present with a more acute onset of symptoms, fever, and a history of exposure to an allergen.
* Bronchiectasis (D) would typically present with a history of recurrent respiratory infections and a more prominent cough.
* Bronchial asthma (E) would typically present with more variable airflow obstruction and a history of episodic symptoms.

According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines, the diagnosis of COPD is based on a combination of symptoms, medical history, and spirometry results. The patient's symptoms, physical examination, and spirometry results meet the criteria for a diagnosis of COPD.",Success
"A 29-year-old G1P0 woman is giving birth at 38 weeks gestation to a  boy via vaginal delivery. As soon as the infant is clear of the vagina, a congenital malformation of the abdomen is observed. The infant is removed from the delivery room for further evaluation. Visual inspection shows loops of intestine protruding out of his abdomen on the right side. His APGAR scores are 7 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. His heart rate is 125/min, and his respirations are 45/min. All reflexes appear normal. There are no other visible defects. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. Wrap the intestines in a sterile bowel bag.

The scenario describes a newborn with a congenital malformation, specifically a gastroschisis, which is a type of abdominal wall defect where the intestines protrude outside the abdominal cavity. The priority is to protect the exposed intestines from infection and prevent dehydration.

Wrapping the intestines in a sterile bowel bag (option A) is the most appropriate next step in management. This helps to:

1. Prevent infection: The sterile bag creates a barrier between the exposed intestines and the environment, reducing the risk of bacterial contamination.
2. Reduce fluid loss: The bag helps to minimize evaporation of fluids from the exposed intestines, reducing the risk of dehydration.
3. Maintain temperature: The bag can help to keep the intestines warm, which is essential for maintaining the newborn's overall body temperature.

While the other options are important, they are not the most immediate priority:

* Transferring the newborn to the NICU (option B) will likely occur, but it is not the first step in management.
* Starting IV fluids (option C) may be necessary, but it is not as critical as protecting the exposed intestines.
* Placing the newborn under a warmer (option D) is important for maintaining body temperature, but it is secondary to protecting the intestines.
* Transferring the newborn for immediate surgery (option E) may be necessary, but it is not the initial step in management. The newborn needs to be stabilized and prepared for surgery, which includes protecting the exposed intestines.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and other medical organizations recommend wrapping the exposed intestines in a sterile bowel bag as part of the initial management of gastroschisis.",Success
"A 54-year-old woman presents with fatigue, malaise, and shortness of breath over the past 5 months. Past medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed 23 years ago for which she takes naproxen as needed. Her vital signs include: temperature 36.9°C (98.4°F), blood pressure 135/88 mm Hg, pulse 92/min. Physical examination is significant for conjunctival pallor and bilateral ulnar deviation of the metacarpophalangeal joints. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 76 fL
Leukocyte count 7,000/mm3
Platelet count 220,000/mm3
Serum ferritin 310 ng/mL
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 85 mm/h
Which of the following is a feature of this patient's anemia?",D,"The correct answer is A. ↑ serum transferrin receptors.

Let's break down the patient's presentation and laboratory findings to justify this choice:

The patient presents with fatigue, malaise, and shortness of breath, which are common symptoms of anemia. The physical examination reveals conjunctival pallor, indicating anemia. The laboratory findings show a low hemoglobin level (9.2 g/dL) and a low mean corpuscular volume (76 fL), suggesting microcytic anemia.

The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (85 mm/h) suggest chronic inflammation, which can contribute to anemia of chronic disease.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A. ↑ serum transferrin receptors: This is a feature of iron deficiency anemia. Transferrin receptors are increased in response to iron deficiency, as the body tries to increase iron uptake. Given the patient's microcytic anemia and history of chronic inflammation, iron deficiency anemia is a possible diagnosis.

B. ↑ transferrin saturation: This would be seen in iron overload or hemochromatosis, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

C. ↑ methylmalonic acid: This is a feature of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, which is not suggested by the patient's laboratory findings.

D. Upregulation of hepcidin: Hepcidin is a protein that regulates iron homeostasis. In anemia of chronic disease, hepcidin is indeed upregulated, leading to decreased iron availability. However, this is not a direct feature of the patient's anemia.

E. ↑ reticulocyte count: This would be seen in hemolytic anemia or bleeding, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. ↑ serum transferrin receptors, which suggests iron deficiency anemia.",Success
"A six-year-old boy with a history of asthma currently uses an albuterol inhaler as needed to manage his asthma symptoms. His mother brings him into your office because she feels she has had to increase the patient’s use of his inhaler to four times per week for the past month. She also reports that he has woken up three times during the night from his symptoms this month. The boy reports that he is upset because he can’t always keep up with his friends in the playground. His past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis. The patient’s temperature is 98°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% O2 on room air. Auscultation of his lungs reveals bilateral late expiratory wheezes.

What changes should be made to his current asthma treatment regimen?",C,"The correct answer is C. Add fluticasone daily.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms indicate that his current asthma treatment regimen is not adequately controlling his symptoms. He's using his albuterol inhaler four times a week, waking up three times a month due to symptoms, and having difficulty keeping up with his friends during playtime. These symptoms suggest that his asthma is not well-controlled, and he needs a step up in therapy.

According to the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines, the next step in therapy for a patient with mild persistent asthma (which this patient appears to have) is to add a daily inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Fluticasone is a commonly used ICS that can help reduce inflammation in the airways and improve lung function.

Option A (Maintain current therapy) is not correct because the patient's symptoms are not well-controlled, and simply continuing the current regimen will not address the underlying inflammation.

Option B (Add cromolyn prior to exercise) may be helpful for exercise-induced bronchospasm, but it's not the best choice for this patient's overall asthma management.

Option D (Add salmeterol twice daily) is a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) that can help with symptom control, but it should not be used as monotherapy for asthma. The NAEPP guidelines recommend using a LABA in combination with an ICS, not as a replacement for it.

Option E (Add zileuton twice daily) is a leukotriene modifier that can be used as an alternative to ICS, but it's not the preferred choice for this patient's mild persistent asthma.

In summary, adding fluticasone daily to the patient's current regimen is the most appropriate step to help control his asthma symptoms and improve his quality of life.",Success
"A 25-year-old woman comes to the office complaining of pelvic pain and feeling “off” for the past few weeks. She has not had any changes in diet or lifestyle but reports weight loss despite an increase in appetite. In addition, she has been experiencing chest palpitations, increased frequency of diarrhea, and heat intolerance. Physical exam of her thyroid is unremarkable but her TSH was found to be 0.21 mIU/L. A complex structure in her right ovary was detected on ultrasound. Her symptoms can be explained by which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is D. Struma ovarii.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as weight loss, increased appetite, chest palpitations, diarrhea, and heat intolerance, are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The low TSH level (0.21 mIU/L) further supports this diagnosis.

The ultrasound finding of a complex structure in the right ovary suggests a ovarian tumor. Struma ovarii is a rare type of ovarian tumor that is composed of thyroid tissue. In some cases, this tumor can produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, leading to hyperthyroidism.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and presentation:

A. Meigs syndrome is a rare condition characterized by a benign ovarian tumor, ascites, and pleural effusion. While it may present with pelvic pain, it does not typically cause hyperthyroidism.

B. Jod-Basedow phenomenon is a rare condition where iodine exposure triggers hyperthyroidism in individuals with underlying thyroid disease. There is no indication of iodine exposure in this patient.

C. Dermoid cyst is a type of benign ovarian tumor that can cause pelvic pain, but it is not typically associated with hyperthyroidism.

E. Immature teratoma is a type of malignant ovarian tumor that can cause pelvic pain, but it is not typically associated with hyperthyroidism.

In summary, the combination of hyperthyroidism symptoms and the presence of a complex ovarian structure on ultrasound suggests that the patient has struma ovarii, a rare ovarian tumor that can produce excessive thyroid hormones.",Success
"An otherwise healthy 15-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with extreme fatigue and shortness of breath. His temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), the blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg and the pulse is 100/min. Past medical history is noncontributory and he takes no medication. His father and aunt both suffer from mild anemia. On examination, he is very pale and his spleen is enlarged. His hemoglobin is 5 g/dL and platelet count is slightly reduced. His peripheral blood smear is shown in the picture. Over the next 2 weeks, the patient recovers, and his hemoglobin is 11 g/dL. Which of the following best represents the pattern of inheritance of this patient underlying disorder?",B,"The correct answer is B. Autosomal dominant.

The patient's presentation with extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, and pale skin suggests anemia, which is confirmed by the low hemoglobin level of 5 g/dL. The peripheral blood smear shows abnormal red blood cells with a spherical shape, suggesting hereditary spherocytosis.

Hereditary spherocytosis is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in the red blood cell membrane, such as ankyrin, spectrin, and band 3. The inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disease.

The patient's family history, with a father and aunt suffering from mild anemia, supports an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. If the disorder were autosomal recessive, the patient would likely have a more severe presentation, and the family history would not be consistent with the observed pattern. X-linked recessive and X-linked dominant inheritance patterns are also unlikely, given the presence of affected individuals of both sexes in the family. Multifactorial inheritance is not a clear fit, as the disease is caused by a specific genetic mutation rather than a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

The patient's recovery over the next two weeks, with an increase in hemoglobin to 11 g/dL, is consistent with the natural course of hereditary spherocytosis, which can have a variable presentation and may be triggered by viral infections or other stressors.",Success
"A 65-year-old male presents to the emergency department from his home complaining of dyspnea. He is alert and oriented. The following arterial blood gas readings are drawn: pH: 7.33 (Normal: 7.35-7.45), pCO2: 70 mmHg (Normal: 35-45 mmHg), HCO3 33 (Normal: 21-26 mEq/L) Which of the following is most likely to have produced this patient’s condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Chronic obstructive bronchitis.

Here's why:

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) readings indicate a respiratory acidosis, which is characterized by a pH below 7.35 and an elevated pCO2 level. The pH of 7.33 is slightly acidic, and the pCO2 level of 70 mmHg is significantly elevated, indicating that the patient is retaining carbon dioxide.

The elevated bicarbonate (HCO3) level of 33 mEq/L suggests that the body is attempting to compensate for the acidosis by increasing bicarbonate production. This is a characteristic finding in chronic respiratory acidosis, which is often seen in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis.

Option A, panic attack, would not produce this pattern of ABG results. Panic attacks can cause respiratory alkalosis, not acidosis.

Option B, mechanical ventilation, is unlikely to cause respiratory acidosis, as it would typically be used to treat respiratory failure and would be expected to decrease pCO2 levels.

Option C, diabetic ketoacidosis, would produce a metabolic acidosis, characterized by a low pH and a low bicarbonate level, which is not consistent with the patient's ABG results.

Option D, pulmonary embolus, can cause respiratory failure and acidosis, but the ABG results would typically show a lower pH and a lower bicarbonate level than seen in this patient.

Therefore, based on the ABG results, chronic obstructive bronchitis (Option E) is the most likely cause of the patient's condition.",Success

Which of the following statements best describes the pathogenesis of this patient’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. The drug caused uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation.

The patient's symptoms, including fever, tachypnea, chest discomfort, and profuse sweating, suggest a condition known as thyrotoxic crisis or thyroid storm. The presence of bilateral cataracts and a gradual decrease in vision over the past 3 months also points towards a thyroid-related disorder.

The patient's symptoms appeared suddenly after taking two foreign-manufactured fat-burning pills, which likely contain thyroid hormone or thyroid-stimulating substances. The pills caused an acute increase in thyroid hormone levels, leading to thyrotoxic crisis.

Option B is the correct answer because the excessive thyroid hormone levels caused uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation, leading to an increase in metabolic rate, heat production, and ultimately, the patient's symptoms. This is a known mechanism of thyroid hormone action, where it increases the metabolic rate by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation and generating heat.

Option A is incorrect because while epinephrine release can contribute to some of the patient's symptoms, such as tachycardia and hypertension, it is not the primary cause of thyrotoxic crisis.

Option C is incorrect because there is no evidence of bacterial contamination or infection in the patient's presentation.

Option D is incorrect because a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction is an allergic response, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Option E is incorrect because the hypothalamic temperature center is not directly stimulated by the drug to produce hyperthermia. Instead, the excessive thyroid hormone levels lead to an increase in metabolic rate and heat production, causing the patient's symptoms.",Success

There are diffuse petechiae around hair follicles on her abdomen and both thighs. Laboratory studies show a prothrombin time of 12 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 35 seconds, and a bleeding time of 11 minutes. Arthrocentesis of the right knee shows bloody synovial fluid. The patient’s condition is most likely associated with a defect in a reaction that occurs in which of the following cellular structures?",B,"The correct answer is B. Rough endoplasmic reticulum.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a bleeding disorder, specifically a coagulopathy. The presence of petechiae, bleeding gums, and bloody synovial fluid in the knee joint indicate a defect in blood clotting. The prolonged bleeding time and normal prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time suggest a platelet-related disorder.

The patient's condition is most likely associated with a defect in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where proteins, including clotting factors, are synthesized and modified. In this case, the defect is likely related to the synthesis or processing of platelet glycoproteins, leading to a platelet function disorder.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Lysosomes are involved in cellular digestion and recycling, and defects in lysosomal function are associated with lysosomal storage diseases, not bleeding disorders.

C. The nucleus is the site of DNA transcription, and defects in nuclear function are associated with genetic disorders, not bleeding disorders.

D. The extracellular space is where clotting factors interact to form a blood clot, but defects in this space are not directly related to the synthesis or processing of clotting factors.

E. Free ribosomes are involved in protein synthesis, but they are not directly related to the synthesis or processing of clotting factors, which occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

She does not wish to become pregnant until she finishes college in six months. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,C,"The correct answer is C. Administer ulipristal acetate.

Here's why:

The patient is seeking emergency contraception (EC) after unprotected intercourse. The most effective and appropriate option for her is ulipristal acetate, a selective progesterone receptor modulator. It is specifically approved for EC and can be taken up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse.

Option A, inserting a copper-containing intrauterine device (IUD), is not the most appropriate choice for several reasons. First, the patient is not seeking a long-term contraceptive method. Second, IUD insertion requires a procedure, which may not be feasible in this urgent situation. Finally, the patient's allergy to certain metals may be a concern, although copper is not typically associated with jewelry or metal alloy allergies.

Option B, mifepristone, is not approved for EC in the United States, and its use for this indication is not supported by current guidelines.

Option D, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, is a hormonal contraceptive method, but it is not approved for EC and would not provide immediate protection against pregnancy.

Option E, combined oral contraceptive, is not an appropriate choice for EC, as it is not specifically approved for this indication and may not be effective in preventing pregnancy when taken after unprotected intercourse.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend ulipristal acetate as a safe and effective option for EC.",Success

The patient's symptoms, including the acute onset of a rash with targetoid lesions and a vesicular center, fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills, are consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe cutaneous adverse reaction. Lamotrigine is a known cause of SJS, and the timing of the patient's symptoms, 2 weeks after starting a new medication, is consistent with the typical onset of SJS.

Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant medication commonly used to treat bipolar disorder. While it is generally well-tolerated, it carries a risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).

The other options are less likely to cause SJS:

A. Quetiapine is an antipsychotic medication that can cause skin reactions, but SJS is not a common adverse effect.

C. Valproate is an anticonvulsant medication that can cause skin reactions, but SJS is rare.

D. Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC) is an antipsychotic medication that can cause skin reactions, but SJS is not a common adverse effect.

E. Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant that can cause skin reactions, but SJS is rare.

It's essential to note that SJS is a medical emergency that requires prompt recognition and treatment. If you suspect SJS, the patient should be immediately referred to a dermatologist or a burn center for further evaluation and management.",Success
"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 6-month history of mild episodic abdominal pain. The episodes occur every 1–2 months and last for a few hours. The pain is located in the epigastrium, radiates to his back, and is occasionally associated with mild nausea. His mother is concerned that his condition might be hereditary because his older sister was diagnosed with congenital heart disease. He is otherwise healthy and has met all developmental milestones. He is at the 75th percentile for height and the 65th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows no abdominal distention, guarding, or rebound tenderness. Which of the following congenital conditions would best explain this patient's symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is E. Pancreas divisum.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including episodic abdominal pain in the epigastrium that radiates to the back, along with occasional nausea, are consistent with pancreatitis. The fact that the pain is mild and occurs every 1-2 months, lasting only a few hours, suggests a intermittent and self-limiting process.

Pancreas divisum is a congenital anomaly where the pancreas fails to fuse properly, resulting in two separate ducts that drain into the duodenum. This can cause intermittent obstruction of the pancreatic duct, leading to recurrent pancreatitis.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms as well:

A. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis typically presents in infancy with projectile vomiting and a palpable pyloric mass, which is not consistent with this patient's symptoms.

B. Biliary cysts can cause abdominal pain, but it is usually more severe and persistent, and often accompanied by jaundice, which is not mentioned in this case.

C. Tracheoesophageal fistula is a congenital anomaly that typically presents in infancy with respiratory distress, coughing, and choking, which is not consistent with this patient's symptoms.

D. Intestinal malrotation can cause abdominal pain, but it is usually more severe and accompanied by vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension, which is not mentioned in this case.

It's worth noting that the patient's family history of congenital heart disease in his older sister is not directly related to his symptoms, and pancreas divisum is not typically associated with congenital heart disease.",Success
"A healthy, full-term 1-day-old female is being evaluated after birth and is noted to have a cleft palate and a systolic ejection murmur at the second left intercostal space. A chest radiograph is obtained which reveals a boot-shaped heart and absence of a thymus. An echocardiogram is done which shows pulmonary stenosis with a hypertrophic right ventricular wall, ventricular septal defect, and overriding of the aorta. Which of the following additional features is expected to be seen in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Seizures due to hypocalcemia.

The patient's symptoms and echocardiogram results are consistent with a diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), a congenital heart defect. The boot-shaped heart and absence of a thymus on the chest radiograph are also indicative of DiGeorge syndrome, a genetic disorder that often occurs in conjunction with TOF.

DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a deletion of chromosome 22q11.2, which can lead to abnormalities in the development of the palate, heart, and thymus. One of the common features of DiGeorge syndrome is hypocalcemia, which can cause seizures in newborns. Therefore, option A is the most likely additional feature to be seen in this patient.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's diagnosis:

* Option B, catlike cry, is a feature of Cri du Chat syndrome, a different genetic disorder.
* Option C, hyperthyroidism from transplacental antibodies, is not typically associated with DiGeorge syndrome or TOF.
* Option D, webbing of the neck, is a feature of Turner syndrome, another genetic disorder.
* Option E, increased phenylalanine in the blood, is a feature of phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder that is not related to the patient's diagnosis.

It's essential to note that DiGeorge syndrome can have a wide range of features, and not all patients will exhibit all of the typical symptoms. However, based on the provided information, seizures due to hypocalcemia are a likely additional feature in this patient.",Success
"A 58-year-old male with a history of obesity and hypertension presents to his primary care physician for a follow-up visit. He reports that he feels well and has no complaints. He currently takes hydrochlorothiazide. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 135/80 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 17/min. His BMI is 31 kg/m2. Results of a lipid panel are: Total cholesterol is 280 mg/dl, triglycerides are 110 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol is 40 mg/dl, and LDL cholesterol is 195 mg/dl. Her physician considers starting her on atorvastatin. Which of the following will most likely decrease after initiating this medication?",A,"The correct answer is C. HMG-CoA.

Here's why:

Atorvastatin is a statin medication that inhibits the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is involved in the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. By inhibiting this enzyme, atorvastatin reduces the production of cholesterol in the liver, leading to a decrease in LDL cholesterol levels.

HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA) is a key intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. When atorvastatin inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, it reduces the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, which is the next step in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. As a result, HMG-CoA levels will decrease.

Mevalonate (option A) is the product of the reaction catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase. When atorvastatin inhibits this enzyme, mevalonate production will also decrease.

Acetoacetyl-CoA (option B) is an intermediate in the synthesis of cholesterol, but it is not directly affected by atorvastatin.

Diacylglycerol (option D) is a precursor to triglyceride synthesis, and its levels are not directly affected by atorvastatin.

High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (option E) is actually expected to increase with statin therapy, including atorvastatin, as it promotes the expression of genes involved in HDL synthesis and increases the production of apolipoprotein A-I, a major component of HDL.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. HMG-CoA.",Success
"A 54-year-old man presents with the acute onset of seizures and hallucinations. The patient’s wife says that he had been on a camping trip a few months earlier to study bats but otherwise has not traveled recently. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, managed medically with hydralazine and enalapril. The patient’s condition rapidly deteriorates, and he passes away. An autopsy is performed and a histologic stained section of the brain is shown in the image. Which of the following receptors are targeted by the pathogen most likely responsible for this patient’s condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Acetylcholine receptor.

The image provided is likely showing the characteristic eosinophilic inclusions, known as Negri bodies, which are a hallmark of rabies infection. Given the patient's history of studying bats, which are common carriers of rabies, and the rapid progression of symptoms, rabies is the most likely diagnosis.

Rabies virus targets the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the nervous system, which is responsible for the transmission of the virus across the synapse and the development of the characteristic neurological symptoms, including seizures and hallucinations.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. CCR5 is a receptor targeted by HIV, which is not related to the patient's symptoms or history.

B. CD21 is a receptor targeted by Epstein-Barr virus, which is not typically associated with acute neurological symptoms or Negri bodies.

D. ICAM-1 is a receptor targeted by rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold, and is not related to the patient's condition.

E. GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, not a receptor targeted by a specific pathogen.

Therefore, based on the patient's history and the characteristic histopathological findings, the correct answer is C. Acetylcholine receptor.",Success
A 60-year-old female patient with a history of hypertension presents to an outpatient office for regular check-up and is found to have hypertriglyceridemia. Her physician prescribes high-dose niacin and recommends taking the medication along with aspirin. The side effect the physician is trying to avoid is thought to be mediated by what mechanism?,C,"The correct answer is C. Release of prostaglandins.

Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is a medication used to treat hypertriglyceridemia. One of the common side effects of niacin is skin flushing, which can be uncomfortable for patients. The mechanism behind this side effect is thought to be the release of prostaglandins, which are potent vasodilators that cause blood vessels to dilate, leading to increased blood flow to the skin and resulting in flushing.

Aspirin is often recommended to be taken with niacin to reduce the incidence and severity of skin flushing. Aspirin inhibits the production of prostaglandins by blocking the enzyme cyclooxygenase, which is necessary for prostaglandin synthesis. By reducing prostaglandin production, aspirin can help minimize the flushing side effect associated with niacin.

The other options are not directly related to the mechanism of niacin-induced skin flushing:

A. Bile deposition in the dermis is not a known mechanism for niacin-induced skin flushing.

B. Immune complex formation is not a mechanism associated with niacin side effects.

D. Mast cell degranulation is involved in allergic reactions, not niacin-induced skin flushing.

E. T cell activation is not directly related to niacin-induced skin flushing.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Release of prostaglandins.",Success

A liver biopsy is performed and shows mononuclear infiltrates that are limited to portal tracts and periportal hepatocyte necrosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",A,"The correct answer is A. Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir therapy.

The patient's laboratory results and liver biopsy findings are consistent with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The patient is HCV RNA positive, and the liver biopsy shows mononuclear infiltrates limited to portal tracts and periportal hepatocyte necrosis, which is characteristic of chronic HCV infection.

The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy as the first-line treatment for chronic HCV infection. For genotype 1 HCV, which is the patient's genotype, the recommended regimen is sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (Harvoni) for 12 weeks.

Option C, interferon and ribavirin therapy, is an older treatment regimen that is no longer recommended as first-line therapy due to its lower efficacy and higher risk of adverse effects compared to DAA therapy.

Options B and D are not correct because tenofovir and velpatasvir are not recommended for the treatment of HCV genotype 1, and tenofovir and entecavir are not approved for the treatment of HCV.

Option E, scheduling a follow-up in 6 months, is not appropriate because the patient has active HCV infection that requires treatment to prevent liver disease progression.

In summary, the most appropriate next step in management is to initiate sofosbuvir and ledipasvir therapy to treat the patient's chronic HCV infection.",Success
A 44-year-old woman with hypothyroidism comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of tingling in her feet and poor balance. Her only medication is levothyroxine. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor and an ataxic gait. Proprioception and sense of vibration are decreased in her toes bilaterally. Laboratory studies show macrocytic anemia and normal thyroid hormone levels. Histological evaluation of tissue samples obtained by esophagogastroduodenoscopy reveals atrophic changes of the gastric body and fundus with normal antral mucosa. Which of the following structures is most likely being targeted by antibodies in this patient?,C,"The correct answer is C. Parietal cells.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of pernicious anemia, which is a type of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. The symptoms of tingling in the feet and poor balance are consistent with peripheral neuropathy, which is a common complication of vitamin B12 deficiency. The physical examination findings of conjunctival pallor and ataxic gait are also consistent with anemia and peripheral neuropathy. The laboratory results showing macrocytic anemia and normal thyroid hormone levels support this diagnosis.

The histological evaluation of tissue samples obtained by esophagogastroduodenoscopy reveals atrophic changes of the gastric body and fundus with normal antral mucosa, which is consistent with atrophic gastritis. This condition is often associated with autoimmune destruction of parietal cells in the stomach, leading to a lack of intrinsic factor production and subsequent vitamin B12 deficiency.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and diagnosis:

A. Islet cell cytoplasm is targeted in type 1 diabetes, which is not relevant to this patient's symptoms.

B. Deamidated gliadin peptide is a marker for celiac disease, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and diagnosis.

D. Smooth muscle is not a specific target of antibodies in this patient's condition.

E. Erythrocytes are not directly targeted by antibodies in pernicious anemia, although the patient does have anemia.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Parietal cells, which are being targeted by antibodies in this patient, leading to atrophic gastritis and vitamin B12 deficiency.",Success
"A 26-year-old female complains of frequent, large volume urination. This negatively affects her sleep, as she has to frequently wake up at night to urinate. She also complains of increased thirst. Her past medical history is significant for bipolar disorder that is treated with lithium for 3 years. Serum osmolality is 425 mOsm/kg, and urine osmolality is 176 mOsm/kg. Which of the following best explains this patient’s serum and urine osmolality?",C,"The correct answer is C. ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms of frequent, large volume urination, and increased thirst, suggest a diagnosis of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). NDI is a condition where the kidneys are unable to concentrate urine in response to antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin.

The laboratory results support this diagnosis:

* Serum osmolality of 425 mOsm/kg is slightly elevated, indicating dehydration.
* Urine osmolality of 176 mOsm/kg is low, indicating that the kidneys are not able to concentrate the urine.

Lithium, a medication used to treat bipolar disorder, is a known cause of NDI. Lithium can damage the renal collecting ducts, leading to resistance to ADH, which normally helps to concentrate urine by increasing water reabsorption in the collecting ducts.

Option A is incorrect because hypothalamic over-production of ADH would lead to increased urine osmolality, not decreased.

Option B is also incorrect because decreased production of ADH would lead to central diabetes insipidus, which is a different condition characterized by decreased urine osmolality and polyuria.

Option D is not relevant to this patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Option E is incorrect because increased aquaporin expression in the renal collecting ducts would actually increase water reabsorption and urine concentration, which is the opposite of what is seen in this patient.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts, which is consistent with lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.",Success
"An 8-year-old girl presents to her pediatrician with intensely pruritic lesions over her buttocks, as shown. These lesions occur intermittently but have worsened over time. Her medical history is remarkable for iron deficiency, for which she is on ferrous sulfate. The patient has also experienced intermittent episodes of mild diarrhea, previously diagnosed as lactose intolerance. Her height is at the 30th percentile and weight is at the 25th percentile for age and sex. An immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase titer is 5 times the upper limit of normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Celiac disease.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including intensely pruritic lesions on the buttocks, intermittent diarrhea, and growth retardation (height and weight below the 30th percentile), are consistent with celiac disease. The presence of iron deficiency, which is a common complication of celiac disease, further supports this diagnosis.

The IgA tissue transglutaminase titer being 5 times the upper limit of normal is a strong indicator of celiac disease. Tissue transglutaminase is an enzyme that is targeted by autoantibodies in celiac disease, and elevated levels of these autoantibodies are a diagnostic marker for the condition.

While the other options could potentially cause some of the patient's symptoms, they are less likely to be the primary cause of her condition:

A. Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that can cause diarrhea and growth retardation, but it is less likely to cause the characteristic skin lesions seen in this patient.

B. Giardiasis is a parasitic infection that can cause diarrhea, but it is not typically associated with skin lesions or iron deficiency.

D. Common variable immune deficiency is a primary immunodeficiency disorder that can cause recurrent infections and diarrhea, but it is not typically associated with skin lesions or iron deficiency.

E. Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a vasculitis that can cause skin lesions, but it is typically associated with palpable purpura, arthritis, and abdominal pain, which are not mentioned in this patient's presentation.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the diagnosis of celiac disease is based on a combination of clinical, serologic, and histopathologic criteria. The presence of symptoms, elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase titers, and characteristic histopathologic findings on duodenal biopsy are all consistent with a diagnosis of celiac disease.",Success

Urine and blood samples for culture and sensitivity tests are obtained. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",A,"The correct answer is A. Inpatient treatment with intravenous ciprofloxacin.

Justification:

The patient presents with severe symptoms, including fever, chills, and costovertebral angle tenderness, which suggest a severe urinary tract infection (UTI). The laboratory results support this diagnosis, with leukocytosis, pyuria, and bacteriuria (nitrite positivity). The patient's medical history, including chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and recent toe amputation, increases his risk for complications and sepsis.

Given the severity of the patient's condition, inpatient treatment is necessary. Intravenous antibiotics are required to ensure adequate treatment of the UTI and to address the potential for sepsis. Ciprofloxacin is a suitable choice for UTI treatment, as it covers a broad spectrum of bacteria, including Gram-negative organisms commonly found in UTIs.

Outpatient treatment with oral antibiotics (options B and C) is not appropriate for this patient due to the severity of his symptoms and the risk of complications. Hemodialysis (option D) is not indicated at this time, as the patient's kidney function, although impaired, is not acutely deteriorating. A CT scan with contrast (option E) may be useful in evaluating for complications such as pyelonephritis or abscesses, but it is not the next immediate step in management.

Na+: 154 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 27 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is D. 5% dextrose IV with 0.45% saline IV.

The patient's presentation suggests hypovolemia due to excessive drainage output (>1 liter/day) following pancreaticoduodenectomy. The laboratory values indicate a normal serum sodium level (154 mEq/L), which rules out hyponatremia. However, the patient's dry skin and mucous membranes, along with the high pulse rate (120/min), suggest dehydration.

The best next step in management is to administer IV fluids to replenish the patient's volume deficit. Among the options, 5% dextrose IV with 0.45% saline IV (option D) is the most appropriate choice. This solution provides a combination of glucose (for caloric support) and hypotonic saline (to help replenish fluids and electrolytes).

Option A (0.45% saline IV) is not sufficient, as it lacks caloric support. Option B (0.9% saline IV) is not ideal, as it may exacerbate dehydration due to its isotonic nature. Option C (5% dextrose IV) lacks electrolyte replacement, which is essential in this scenario. Option E (oral free water replacement) is not suitable, as the patient is difficult to arouse and may not be able to tolerate oral intake.

It's essential to note that the patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium, should be closely monitored and replaced as necessary to prevent complications. Additionally, the patient's drainage output should be closely monitored, and the surgical team should be informed of the patient's condition to address any potential surgical complications.",Success

Which of the following is the most likely pathogen?",E,"The correct answer is E. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weakness, are consistent with a gastrointestinal infection.
* The fact that her symptoms began after eating the in-flight meal suggests a foodborne illness.
* The patient's travel history to India, where the incidence of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is high, increases the likelihood of ETEC as the causative agent.
* ETEC is a common cause of traveler's diarrhea, and its symptoms match the patient's presentation, including watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weakness.
* The patient's lack of fever and normal blood pressure suggest a non-invasive infection, which is consistent with ETEC.
* The other options are less likely:
	+ Giardia intestinalis (A) typically causes a more chronic diarrhea, and the patient's symptoms are more acute.
	+ Shigella species (B) often causes a more severe illness with fever, bloody stools, and tenesmus, which are not present in this patient.
	+ Staphylococcus aureus (C) is more commonly associated with food poisoning from contaminated meat or dairy products, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with staphylococcal food poisoning.
	+ Enteroinvasive E. coli (D) can cause a more severe illness with bloody stools and fever, which are not present in this patient.

"A research group has created a novel screening test for a rare disorder. A robust clinical trial is performed in a group of 100 subjects comparing the new screening test against the gold standard. The results are given in the table below:
Screening test\gold standard Disease present Disease absent
Positive 45 15
Negative 5 35
Which of the following is most correct regarding the statistical power of this new screening test?",E,"The correct answer is E. If the sensitivity of this screening test were decreased, the statistical power would decrease.

Here's why:

Statistical power refers to the ability of a study to detect a statistically significant difference or effect when it is present. In the context of diagnostic testing, power is related to the sensitivity of the test.

Sensitivity is the proportion of true positives (disease present and test positive) among all those with the disease. In this case, the sensitivity of the new screening test is 45/(45+5) = 0.9 or 90%.

The power of a test is not directly calculable from the given data, but we can infer its relationship with sensitivity. If the sensitivity of the test were decreased, it would mean that fewer true positives would be detected, leading to a decrease in the power of the test.

Option A is incorrect because the gold standard is not being compared to the new screening test in terms of power; rather, the new test is being evaluated against the gold standard.

Option B is incorrect because repeating the study could potentially affect the power of the test, depending on various factors such as sample size, population characteristics, and test performance.

Option C is incorrect because the power of the test cannot be calculated from the given data.

Option D is incorrect because increasing the specificity of the test (the proportion of true negatives among those without the disease) would not directly affect the power of the test. Specificity is related to the false positive rate, whereas power is related to the true positive rate (sensitivity).",Success
"A 25-year-old woman presents to her new family physician for a follow-up appointment. She previously presented with itching, as well as frequent and painful urination. A vaginal swab was taken and sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. Diplococci were seen on Gram stain and were grown on Thayer-Martin agar. When discussing her infection, the patient says that she uses safe sex practices. Her history is significant for meningitis and for infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The physician discusses that the reason behind these infections comes from a defect in the innate immune system. Which of the following best describes the component that is likely deficient in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is A. Acts as an important opsonin.

The patient's history of meningitis and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, as well as the current diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection (based on the Gram stain and Thayer-Martin agar growth), suggests a defect in the innate immune system. Specifically, the patient likely has a deficiency in late complement components, such as C6, C7, C8, or C9.

These late complement components are important opsonins, which help to mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytic cells. Deficiencies in these components can lead to increased susceptibility to infections, particularly with encapsulated bacteria like Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The other options do not accurately describe the component that is likely deficient in this patient:

B. Bradykinin plays a role in angioedema, but it is not directly related to the patient's infections.

C. C1 esterase inhibitor is involved in the regulation of the classical complement pathway, but its degradation is not directly related to the patient's infections.

D. The formation of pores in the cell membrane is a function of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which is composed of complement components C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9. While a deficiency in these components could lead to impaired MAC function, this is not the primary defect in this patient.

E. The alternative complement pathway is activated by microbial surfaces and does not involve the late complement components that are likely deficient in this patient.

"A 55-year-old woman with papillary thyroid carcinoma underwent total thyroidectomy. She has no significant medical history. On postoperative day 1, she develops perioral numbness and a tingling sensation, along with paresthesia of the hands and feet. The physical examination reveals that she is anxious and confused. Her pulse is 90/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, the respirations are 22/min, and the temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F). Latent tetany (carpal spasm) is evident in the right arm. This is observed when the sphygmomanometer cuff pressure is raised above the systolic blood pressure and held for 3 minutes. The laboratory test results are as follows:
Serum calcium 6.7 mg/dL
Serum sodium 143 mEq/L
Serum potassium 4.4 mEq/L
Serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL
Blood urea 16 mg/dL
Serum magnesium 1.1 mEq/L
What is the most likely cause of this condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Inadvertent surgical removal of parathyroid glands.

The patient's symptoms, such as perioral numbness, tingling sensation, and paresthesia of the hands and feet, are consistent with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels). The physical examination finding of latent tetany (carpal spasm) also supports this diagnosis. The laboratory results show a serum calcium level of 6.7 mg/dL, which is below the normal range.

The parathyroid glands play a crucial role in regulating calcium levels in the blood. Inadvertent surgical removal of the parathyroid glands during the total thyroidectomy procedure is a common cause of hypocalcemia. This is because the parathyroid glands are located near the thyroid gland and can be accidentally removed or damaged during surgery.

Option B, congenital absence of parathyroid glands, is unlikely in a 55-year-old woman with no prior medical history. Option C, DiGeorge syndrome, is a congenital disorder that affects the development of the parathyroid glands, but it is typically diagnosed in childhood.

Option D, chronic hypomagnesemia, can contribute to hypocalcemia, but the patient's serum magnesium level is within the normal range (1.1 mEq/L). While magnesium deficiency can exacerbate hypocalcemia, it is not the primary cause in this case.

Option E, hungry bone syndrome, is a condition that occurs after parathyroidectomy, where the bones rapidly take up calcium and phosphorus, leading to hypocalcemia. However, this syndrome typically occurs in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, not papillary thyroid carcinoma.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with hypocalcemia due to inadvertent surgical removal of the parathyroid glands during the total thyroidectomy procedure.",Success
"A 16-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for the evaluation of fatigue for several weeks. The parents report that their son quit doing sports at school because of low energy. The patient's academic performance has declined recently. He spends most of his time in the basement playing video games and eating bowls of cereal. He has no history of serious illness. His mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis and his father has major depressive disorder. The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows conjunctival pallor, inflammation and fissuring of the corners of the mouth, and concavity of the finger nails. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 76 μm3
Platelet count 290,000/mm3
Red cell distribution width 18% (N = 13%–15%)
Leukocyte count 7,000/mm3
Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?""",D,"The correct answer is D. Iron supplementation.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. The laboratory results support this diagnosis:

* Hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.5 g/dL is below the normal range for a male adolescent, indicating anemia.
* Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 76 μm3 is low, suggesting microcytic anemia, which is often seen in iron deficiency.
* Red cell distribution width (RDW) of 18% is elevated, indicating anisocytosis, which is also consistent with iron deficiency anemia.

The patient's history of fatigue, conjunctival pallor, and concavity of the fingernails (koilonychia) further support the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia. The inflammation and fissuring of the corners of the mouth (angular cheilitis) may be related to iron deficiency or other nutritional deficiencies.

Given the diagnosis, iron supplementation is the most appropriate initial step in treatment. Iron deficiency anemia is typically treated with oral iron supplements, such as ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate, to replenish iron stores and improve hemoglobin levels.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Regular blood transfusions are not necessary for iron deficiency anemia, and they carry risks such as transfusion reactions and iron overload.

B. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant medication, which may be relevant given the patient's family history of major depressive disorder. However, it is not indicated for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia.

C. Methylphenidate is a stimulant medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). While the patient's fatigue and decreased academic performance may suggest ADHD, the laboratory results and physical examination findings point to iron deficiency anemia as the primary diagnosis.

E. Allogenic stem cell transplantation is a complex and invasive procedure typically reserved for severe hematological disorders, such as leukemia or aplastic anemia. It is not indicated for iron deficiency anemia.",Success
"A 78-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of painful enlarging bruises and skin ulceration over his thighs and external genitalia. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, mitral regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation. Three days ago, he was started on treatment with warfarin. His only other medications are metformin and lisinopril. His temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 108/min and irregularly irregular, and blood pressure is 155/89 mm Hg. Examination of the skin shows large purpura, hemorrhagic bullae, and areas of skin necrosis over his anterior legs, gluteal region, and penis. This patient is most likely to benefit from treatment with which of the following?",B,"The correct answer is B. Protein C concentrate.

The patient's symptoms, such as painful enlarging bruises and skin ulceration, are consistent with warfarin-induced skin necrosis, a rare but serious complication of warfarin therapy. This condition is often seen in patients with protein C deficiency, which can be acquired or inherited.

Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is caused by the depletion of protein C, a vitamin K-dependent anticoagulant that has a shorter half-life than other vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. When warfarin is initiated, it can cause a rapid decrease in protein C levels, leading to a hypercoagulable state and skin necrosis.

Treatment of warfarin-induced skin necrosis involves discontinuing warfarin, administering vitamin K to reverse the anticoagulant effect, and providing supportive care. In severe cases, protein C concentrate may be necessary to rapidly replenish protein C levels and reverse the hypercoagulable state.

The other options are not directly related to the treatment of warfarin-induced skin necrosis:

A. Hyperbaric oxygen may be used to treat skin ulcers, but it is not a specific treatment for warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

C. Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor used to treat heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, not warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

D. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent used to treat bleeding disorders, but it is not indicated for warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

E. Vancomycin is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, but it is not relevant to the treatment of warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

In summary, protein C concentrate is the most likely treatment to benefit this patient, as it can help reverse the hypercoagulable state and skin necrosis caused by warfarin-induced protein C deficiency.",Success
"A 15-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation of a learning disability. His teachers have reported hyperactivity during class, difficulties with social interaction, and poor scores on reading and writing assessments. Molecular analysis shows an increased number of CGG trinucleotide repeats. Which of the following findings are most likely to be seen on physical examination of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Long face and large everted ears.

The patient's symptoms, including hyperactivity, difficulties with social interaction, and learning disabilities, are consistent with Fragile X syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by an expansion of the CGG trinucleotide repeat in the FMR1 gene. Physical examination of individuals with Fragile X syndrome often reveals distinct facial features, including:

* A long, narrow face
* Large, everted ears
* A prominent forehead
* A high-arched palate

These physical characteristics are not universally present, but they are common enough to be considered diagnostic clues.

The other options are not characteristic of Fragile X syndrome:

A. Frontal balding and cataracts are more commonly associated with myotonic dystrophy.

C. Almond-shaped eyes and downturned mouth are characteristic of Waardenburg syndrome.

D. Flat facies and protruding tongue are more commonly seen in Down syndrome.

E. Thin upper lip and receding chin are not specific to any particular genetic disorder.

It's essential to note that Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that can present with a range of physical and behavioral characteristics, and a diagnosis should be confirmed through molecular analysis, as mentioned in the question.",Success
"A 65-year-old woman presented to the emergency room due to progressive dyspnea. She is a known hypertensive but is poorly compliant with medications. The patient claims to have orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and easy fatigability. On physical examination, the blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. There is prominent neck vein distention. An S3 gallop, bibasilar crackles, and grade 3 bipedal edema were also detected. A 2d echo was performed, which showed a decreased ejection fraction (32%). Which of the following drugs should not be given to this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Metoprolol.

The patient is presenting with symptoms of heart failure, including dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and easy fatigability. The physical examination findings, such as neck vein distention, S3 gallop, bibasilar crackles, and bipedal edema, are also consistent with heart failure. The 2D echo showing a decreased ejection fraction (32%) further supports this diagnosis.

In this scenario, metoprolol, a beta blocker, should not be given to the patient initially. Beta blockers can worsen heart failure by decreasing cardiac contractility and increasing peripheral resistance, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and worsen symptoms. In fact, the patient's blood pressure is already low (80/50 mm Hg), which is a contraindication for beta blocker therapy.

The other options are all potentially beneficial for this patient:

A. Furosemide is a diuretic that can help reduce fluid overload and alleviate symptoms of heart failure.

B. Nesiritide is a B-type natriuretic peptide that can help reduce fluid overload and improve symptoms in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

D. Digoxin is a medication that can help improve cardiac contractility and reduce symptoms in patients with heart failure.

E. Dobutamine is an inotrope that can help increase cardiac contractility and improve cardiac output in patients with heart failure.

It's worth noting that beta blockers can be beneficial in the long-term management of heart failure, but they should be initiated at a low dose and titrated slowly under close monitoring to avoid worsening heart failure. In this scenario, however, the patient's low blood pressure and symptoms of heart failure make metoprolol a poor choice for initial therapy.",Success
"A 49-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea and cough which she developed approx. 8 hours ago. 2 weeks ago she had a prophylactic ovariectomy because of a family history of ovarian cancer. She is known to have type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 1 hypertension, but she does not take her antihypertensives because she is not concerned about her blood pressure. Also, she has a history of opioid abuse. She takes metformin 1000 mg and aspirin 81 mg. She has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for 22 years. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 155/80 mm Hg, heart rate 101/min, respiratory rate 31/min, and temperature 37.9℃ (100.2℉). Blood saturation on room air is 89%. On examination, the patient is dyspneic and acrocyanotic. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral rales over the lower lobes. A cardiac examination is significant for S2 accentuation best heard in the second intercostal space at the left sternal border and S3 presence. There is no leg edema. Neurological examination is within normal limits. Arterial blood gases analysis shows the following results:
pH 7.49
PaO2 58 mm Hg
PaCO2 30 mm Hg
HCO3-  22 mEq/L
Based on the given data, which of the following could cause respiratory failure in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has a history of recent surgery (prophylactic ovariectomy), which increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The patient's tachypnea, dyspnea, and hypoxia are consistent with PE. The accentuation of S2 and presence of S3 on cardiac examination suggest right ventricular strain, which is also consistent with PE.

The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.49, indicating respiratory alkalosis, which is common in PE. The low PaO2 and high PaCO2 levels indicate hypoxia and respiratory failure.

Option A, increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli, is a plausible explanation for respiratory failure in this patient. Pulmonary embolism can cause occlusion of pulmonary arteries, leading to decreased perfusion of certain alveoli, resulting in increased alveolar dead space and respiratory failure.

Option B, ischemia of the medullary respiratory center neurons, is unlikely to be the cause of respiratory failure in this patient, as there is no evidence of neurological deficits or brainstem dysfunction.

Option C, alveolar fibrosis, is not supported by the patient's history or examination findings.

Option D, depression of the respiratory center via opioid receptors activation, is possible due to the patient's history of opioid abuse, but it is less likely to be the primary cause of respiratory failure in this patient, given the other symptoms and examination findings consistent with PE.

Option E, decreased V/Q due to bronchial obstruction, is not supported by the patient's examination findings, as there is no evidence of wheezing or bronchial obstruction.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with pulmonary embolism, and option A, increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli, is a plausible explanation for respiratory failure in this patient.",Success
"A 27-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with acute onset bloody diarrhea. The patient has had severe abdominal pain throughout her entire life with occasional episodes of bloody diarrhea. She has recently lost 7 pounds and has felt generally ill for the past 2 days. She has a past medical history of generalized seizures with her most recent one having occurred 5 days ago. One month ago, the patient was treated for impetigo. The patient admits to occasional cocaine use and binge drinking. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 127/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for diffuse abdominal tenderness and guaiac positive stools. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Hemoglobin: 9 g/dL
Hematocrit: 30%
Leukocyte count: 9,400/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 199,000/mm^3

Cocaine: Positive
Marijuana: Positive

Which of the following is the best explanation for this patient's laboratory findings?",E,"The correct answer is D. Myoglobin toxicity.

Here's a breakdown of the patient's laboratory findings and how they support this answer:

1. **Renal impairment**: The patient's creatinine level is elevated (1.8 mg/dL), indicating kidney damage or impairment.
2. **Hemolytic anemia**: The patient's hemoglobin (9 g/dL) and hematocrit (30%) are low, suggesting anemia. The normal leukocyte count and platelet count rule out other causes of anemia.
3. **Muscle damage**: The patient's AST (62 U/L) and ALT (80 U/L) levels are mildly elevated, indicating muscle damage rather than liver damage.
4. **Urinary findings**: The presence of protein in the urine (proteinuria) and a positive cocaine test suggest that the patient may have experienced rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown) due to cocaine use.
5. **Electrolyte imbalance**: The patient's potassium level (4.9 mEq/L) is slightly elevated, which can be seen in cases of rhabdomyolysis.

Myoglobin toxicity is a complication of rhabdomyolysis, where muscle breakdown releases myoglobin into the bloodstream, which can then cause kidney damage and impairment. The patient's recent seizure, cocaine use, and binge drinking may have triggered the rhabdomyolysis episode.

The other options do not fully explain the patient's laboratory findings:

A. Alcohol-induced liver injury would typically present with more significant elevations in AST and ALT levels.

B. Immune response to streptococcal infection may cause kidney damage, but the patient's laboratory findings are more consistent with rhabdomyolysis.

C. Intestinal IgA deficiency is not related to the patient's laboratory findings.

E. Protein deposition is a vague term and does not specifically explain the patient's laboratory results.

Therefore, the best explanation for this patient's laboratory findings is myoglobin toxicity due to rhabdomyolysis.",Success
A 45-year-old Caucasian male presents to a gastroenterologist complaining of heartburn and difficulty swallowing. He recalls that he has been told by his primary care physician that he suffers from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The gastroenterologist decides to perform an upper endoscopy with biopsy. Which of the following findings would be consistent with Barrett's esophagus?,C,"The correct answer is C. A small region of red, velvet-like mucosa in the lower esophagus.

Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which the lining of the esophagus is replaced by a type of tissue that is similar to the lining of the intestine. This change is called intestinal metaplasia. During an upper endoscopy, Barrett's esophagus typically appears as a small region of red, velvet-like mucosa in the lower esophagus, which is option C.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Paneth cells are normally found in the small intestine, not the lower esophagus. Their presence in the lower esophagus would not be consistent with Barrett's esophagus.

B. Metaplasia in the upper esophagus is not a characteristic finding of Barrett's esophagus. Barrett's esophagus typically affects the lower esophagus, near the gastroesophageal junction.

D. Esophageal varices are dilated veins in the esophagus, often seen in patients with portal hypertension. They are not related to Barrett's esophagus.

E. Neutrophilic infiltration is a finding that may be seen in inflammatory conditions such as esophagitis, but it is not a characteristic feature of Barrett's esophagus.

It's worth noting that the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is typically confirmed by biopsy, which shows the presence of intestinal metaplasia in the esophageal mucosa. The endoscopic appearance, as described in option C, can suggest the presence of Barrett's esophagus, but it is not diagnostic on its own.",Success
"A 16-year-old female patient with a history of mental retardation presents to your clinic with her mother. The mother states that she wants her daughter to have a bilateral tubal ligation after she recently discovered her looking at pornographic materials. She states that her daughter is not capable of understanding the repercussions of sexual intercourse, and that she does not want her to be burdened with a child that she would not be able to raise. Upon discussions with the patient, it is clear that she is not able to understand that sexual intercourse can lead to pregnancy. What should your next step be?",C,"The correct answer is C. Refuse the procedure because it violates the ethical principle of autonomy.

This scenario raises ethical concerns regarding the patient's autonomy and decision-making capacity. Although the patient has mental retardation and may not fully understand the consequences of sexual intercourse, it is essential to prioritize her autonomy and protect her rights.

Bilateral tubal ligation is a permanent form of contraception that requires informed consent from the patient. Since the patient is unable to understand the implications of sexual intercourse, she cannot provide informed consent for the procedure. The mother's request, although motivated by concern for her daughter's well-being, is not a substitute for the patient's autonomy.

Refusing the procedure is the most appropriate response because it respects the patient's autonomy and avoids violating her rights. It is essential to involve the patient in the decision-making process as much as possible, even if she has limited understanding.

Options A, B, D, and E are incorrect because:

A. Scheduling the patient for surgery would violate her autonomy and ignore her inability to provide informed consent.

B. Waiting until the patient is 18 years old does not address the underlying issue of her inability to provide informed consent.

D. Referring the patient to a psychiatrist may be helpful in assessing her decision-making capacity, but it does not guarantee that she can provide informed consent for the procedure.

E. The likelihood of the patient getting pregnant is not the primary concern in this scenario. The focus should be on respecting her autonomy and ensuring that she is not subjected to a permanent and irreversible procedure without her informed consent.",Success
"A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of malaise. He returned from a research trip to Madagascar 2 weeks ago and has since developed a worsening fever with a maximum temperature of 102.2°F (39°C). He also reports some swelling around his neck and groin. He works as a zoologist and was in rural Madagascar studying a rare species of lemur. His past medical history is notable for hypertension and gout. He takes lisinopril and allopurinol. His temperature is 101.9°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 22/min. On exam, he has painful erythematous cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Black hemorrhagic eschars are noted on his fingertips bilaterally. The pathogen responsible for this patient’s condition produces a virulence factor that has which of the following functions?",C,"The correct answer is C. Inhibit phagocytosis.

Based on the patient's symptoms, particularly the black hemorrhagic eschars on his fingertips, and his travel history to Madagascar, the likely diagnosis is plague, caused by Yersinia pestis. Y. pestis produces a virulence factor called Yersinia outer proteins (Yops), which inhibit phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages, allowing the bacteria to evade the host's immune response.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Cleaving immunoglobulin is not a function of Y. pestis virulence factors. While some bacteria, like Streptococcus pyogenes, produce proteases that cleave immunoglobulins, this is not a characteristic of Y. pestis.

B. Inhibiting leukocyte migration is not a specific function of Y. pestis virulence factors. Although Y. pestis can affect leukocyte function, its primary mechanism of immune evasion is through inhibition of phagocytosis.

D. Inhibiting ribosomal function is a mechanism of action of some antibiotics, such as tetracyclines, but it is not a function of Y. pestis virulence factors.

E. Triggering widespread inflammation is a general consequence of many infections, including plague, but it is not a specific function of Y. pestis virulence factors.

It's essential to note that plague is a rare but potentially life-threatening disease, and prompt diagnosis and treatment are crucial. The patient should be isolated, and antibiotic therapy with streptomycin or gentamicin should be initiated as soon as possible.",Success
"A 45-year-old African-American male presents to the family medicine physician to assess the status of his diabetes. After reviewing the laboratory tests, the physician decides to write the patient a prescription for miglitol and states that it must be taken with the first bite of the meal. Which of the following bonds will no longer be cleaved when the patient takes miglitol?",B,"The correct answer is B. Glycosidic bonds.

Miglitol is an oral anti-diabetic medication that belongs to the class of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. It works by inhibiting the enzyme alpha-glucosidase, which breaks down carbohydrates into simple sugars in the small intestine. Specifically, miglitol inhibits the cleavage of glycosidic bonds, which are the bonds between carbohydrates (such as sucrose, maltose, and dextrins) and their constituent sugars.

By inhibiting the cleavage of glycosidic bonds, miglitol reduces the absorption of carbohydrates from the gut, thereby decreasing the postprandial glucose peak and improving glycemic control in patients with diabetes. This is why it is essential to take miglitol with the first bite of a meal, as it allows the medication to work effectively on the carbohydrates ingested during that meal.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Phosphodiester bonds are found in nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and are not related to carbohydrate digestion or miglitol's mechanism of action.

C. Peptide bonds are found in proteins and are not affected by miglitol.

D. Cystine bonds are a type of disulfide bond found in proteins and are not related to carbohydrate digestion or miglitol's mechanism of action.

E. Hydrogen bonds are a type of weak chemical bond that plays a role in the structure and function of biomolecules, but they are not specifically related to carbohydrate digestion or miglitol's mechanism of action.",Success
"A previously healthy 24-year-old man comes to the physician 1 day after the onset of burning pain, swelling, and multiple blisters over the left index finger. He works as a dental assistant and is concerned about not being able to work. The patient wonders if the symptoms might be related to a hunting trip he returned from 1 week ago because he remembers seeing a lot of poison oak. He is sexually active with one female partner, and they do not use condoms. His father has a history of thromboangiitis obliterans. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years. He drinks two to four beers on social occasions. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows swelling and erythema of the pulp space of the left index finger; there are multiple 3-mm vesicles. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 12,000 cells/mm3. In addition to supportive therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. Oral acyclovir.

The patient's symptoms, such as burning pain, swelling, and multiple blisters on the left index finger, are consistent with a diagnosis of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The patient's occupation as a dental assistant and lack of condom use suggest a possible risk of HSV transmission. The patient's history of a hunting trip and exposure to poison oak is unlikely to be related to the current symptoms.

Oral acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is effective in treating HSV infections. It can help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms, as well as prevent future outbreaks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend antiviral therapy for the treatment of HSV infections.

Incision and drainage of the pulp space (option B) is not indicated, as it may lead to further complications, such as infection or scarring.

Oral cephalexin (option C) is an antibiotic that is ineffective against viral infections like HSV.

Smoking cessation (option D) is an important health recommendation, but it is not directly related to the management of the patient's current symptoms.

Washing thoroughly (option E) is a general hygiene practice, but it is not a specific treatment for HSV infections.

In addition to oral acyclovir, the patient should be advised to practice good hygiene, avoid close contact with others, and keep the affected area clean and dry to prevent the spread of the infection.",Success
"A 63-year-old man presents to the ambulatory medical clinic with symptoms of dysphagia and ‘heartburn’, which he states have become more troublesome over the past year. His past medical history is significant for hypertension and GERD. He takes lisinopril for hypertension and has failed multiple different therapies for his GERD. On physical exam, he is somewhat tender to palpation over his upper abdomen. Barium swallow demonstrates a subdiaphragmatic gastroesophageal junction, with herniation of the gastric fundus into the left hemithorax. Given the following options, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient’s underlying condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Surgical gastropexy.

The patient's symptoms of dysphagia and heartburn, along with the barium swallow findings, suggest a diagnosis of paraesophageal hernia (PEH), a type of hiatal hernia where the gastric fundus herniates into the thorax through the diaphragmatic hiatus. The patient's history of failed GERD therapies and the presence of a subdiaphragmatic gastroesophageal junction on barium swallow support this diagnosis.

Given the patient's symptoms and the severity of the herniation, surgical intervention is the most appropriate next step. Surgical gastropexy, which involves fixing the stomach in its normal position and repairing the hiatal hernia, is the recommended treatment for PEH. This procedure can be performed laparoscopically or open, and it aims to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications such as incarceration or strangulation, and improve quality of life.

The other options are not suitable for the following reasons:

A. Lifestyle modification: While lifestyle changes, such as weight loss, avoiding trigger foods, and elevating the head of the bed, may help alleviate GERD symptoms, they are not sufficient to address the underlying anatomical defect of a paraesophageal hernia.

B. Combined antacid therapy: Antacids may provide temporary relief from heartburn symptoms, but they do not address the underlying hernia and may not be effective in managing symptoms in the long term.

C. Continue on Cimetidine: Cimetidine is an H2 blocker, which may help reduce acid production and alleviate heartburn symptoms. However, it is not a suitable long-term solution for managing a paraesophageal hernia, and its effectiveness may decrease over time.

D. Continue on Omeprazole: Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that can help reduce acid production and alleviate heartburn symptoms. While it may be useful in managing GERD symptoms, it is not a substitute for surgical intervention in the management of a paraesophageal hernia.

In summary, surgical gastropexy is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's underlying condition, given the severity of the herniation and the patient's symptoms.",Success
"A 63-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic instability.

Currently, his temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 84/46 mmHg with a mean arterial pressure of 59 mmHg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 14/min. His telemetry shows sinus tachycardia. His blood cultures are pending, but Gram stain demonstrated gram-negative bacilli. Which of the following best describes the form of shock and the skin exam?",B,"The correct answer is B. Distributive shock with warm skin.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest septic shock, which is a type of distributive shock. Septic shock is characterized by hypotension (blood pressure < 65 mmHg) and organ dysfunction due to an overwhelming infection. In this case, the patient has a fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, which are all consistent with septic shock.

The skin exam is also consistent with distributive shock. In distributive shock, the skin is typically warm and flushed due to vasodilation, which is a hallmark of sepsis. This is in contrast to other types of shock, such as cardiogenic or hypovolemic shock, where the skin is typically cool or cold due to vasoconstriction.

The other options are not correct:

A. Cardiogenic shock is characterized by cool or cold skin due to decreased cardiac output, which is not consistent with the patient's warm skin.

C. Hypovolemic shock is also characterized by cool or cold skin due to decreased blood volume, which is not consistent with the patient's warm skin.

D. Neurogenic shock is a rare type of shock that occurs due to spinal cord injury or other neurological disorders, and is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or physical exam findings.

E. Obstructive shock is characterized by cool or cold skin due to obstruction of blood flow, which is not consistent with the patient's warm skin.

Which of the following is the best initial test for this patient's chief complaint?",B,"The correct answer is D. Post void residual volumes.

The patient's chief complaint is an inability to urinate, which suggests a possible urinary retention issue. Post void residual (PVR) volumes are a non-invasive test that measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination. This test is useful in evaluating urinary retention and can help identify potential underlying causes, such as neurologic disorders or obstruction.

The patient's symptoms, including difficulty speaking, vision changes, and facial pain, suggest a possible neurological component to her condition. However, the initial focus should be on addressing her acute complaint of urinary retention.

While a Head CT (A) or Head MRI (B) may be necessary to evaluate potential neurological causes of her symptoms, they are not the best initial test for her chief complaint of urinary retention. A lumbar puncture (C) is an invasive procedure that is not indicated at this stage, and domestic abuse screening (E) is important but not directly related to her current chief complaint.

Neurologic examination shows horizontal nystagmus on lateral gaze. She has difficulty walking without assistance. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 11 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 110 μm3
Platelet count 280,000/mm3
Which of the following is most appropriate initial treatment for this patient?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Intravenous thiamine.

The patient's symptoms, including confusion, agitation, disorientation, and difficulty with memory and coordination, are consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy, a neurological disorder caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. The patient's history of alcohol use and the presence of horizontal nystagmus on lateral gaze further support this diagnosis.

The laboratory results, including a high mean corpuscular volume (MCV), are also consistent with thiamine deficiency, as it can cause macrocytic anemia.

Intravenous thiamine is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient, as it can help to rapidly correct the thiamine deficiency and prevent further neurological damage. The American Society of Addiction Medicine and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recommend thiamine supplementation for patients with alcohol use disorder who present with symptoms of Wernicke's encephalopathy.

Chlordiazepoxide (option A) may be used to treat alcohol withdrawal, but it is not the primary treatment for Wernicke's encephalopathy. Naltrexone (option C) is used to treat opioid and alcohol dependence, but it is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms. Vitamin B12 deficiency (option D) can cause neurological symptoms, but it is not the primary diagnosis in this case. Intravenous glucose (option E) may be used to treat hypoglycemia, but it is not the primary treatment for Wernicke's encephalopathy.

It's worth noting that the patient should also receive other supportive treatments, such as hydration and electrolyte replacement, and may require further evaluation and management for alcohol withdrawal and other potential complications.",Success
"An 18-year-old woman makes an appointment with a gynecologist for her first gynecologic examination. She did not disclose her past medical history, but her sexual debut occurred with her boyfriend 3 weeks ago. She is now complaining of a yellow-green, diffuse, malodorous vaginal discharge that she noticed 1 week ago for the first time. She also reported mild pelvic and abdominal pain. cervical motion tenderness was noted during the pelvic examination. The gynecologist also noticed a pink and inflamed nulliparous cervix with a preponderance of small red punctate spots. There was a frothy white discharge with a malodorous odor in the vaginal vault. A wet mount was prepared for a light microscopic examination, which revealed numerous squamous cells and motile organisms. The gynecologist concluded that this was a sexually-transmitted infection. What is the causative organism?",D,"The correct answer is D. Trichomonas vaginalis.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as yellow-green, diffuse, malodorous vaginal discharge, pelvic and abdominal pain, and cervical motion tenderness, are consistent with trichomoniasis.
* The physical examination findings, including a pink and inflamed nulliparous cervix with small red punctate spots (strawberry cervix), are also characteristic of trichomoniasis.
* The wet mount examination revealed numerous squamous cells and motile organisms, which is consistent with Trichomonas vaginalis. The motility of the organisms is a key feature that distinguishes Trichomonas from other organisms.

Trichomonas vaginalis is a protozoan parasite that is a common cause of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in women. It is typically spread through vaginal intercourse and can cause symptoms such as abnormal vaginal discharge, itching, and pain during urination.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

* A. Chlamydia trachomatis is a bacterium that can cause cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease, but it is not typically associated with a frothy, malodorous discharge or motile organisms on wet mount.
* B. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a bacterium that can cause cervicitis and pelvic inflammatory disease, but it is not typically associated with a frothy, malodorous discharge or motile organisms on wet mount.
* C. Ureaplasma urealyticum is a bacterium that can cause urethritis and cervicitis, but it is not typically associated with a frothy, malodorous discharge or motile organisms on wet mount.
* E. Enterobius vermicularis is a parasite that causes pinworm infection, which is not typically associated with vaginal discharge or pelvic pain.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommend that women with symptoms of trichomoniasis, such as abnormal vaginal discharge, itching, and pain during urination, be tested for Trichomonas vaginalis using a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) or wet mount examination.",Success
"A 70-year-old man is brought to the physician by his daughter because of increasing forgetfulness over the past 3 years. Initially, he used to forget his children's names or forget to lock the house door. During the past year, he has gotten lost twice while returning from the grocery store and was unable to tell passersby his address. One time, he went to the park with his granddaughter and returned home alone without realizing he had forgotten her. His daughter says that over the past year, he has withdrawn himself from social gatherings and avoids making conversation. He does not sleep well at night. His daughter has hired a helper to cook and clean his home. On mental status examination, he is oriented only to person. He describes his mood as fair. Short- and long-term memory deficits are present. He appears indifferent about his memory lapses and says this is normal for someone his age. The most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for this patient is a drug that acts on which of the following neurotransmitters?",C,"The correct answer is C. Acetylcholine.

The patient's symptoms, such as increasing forgetfulness, getting lost, and withdrawal from social gatherings, are consistent with Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory impairment. The patient's mental status examination, which shows short- and long-term memory deficits and indifference to his memory lapses, further supports this diagnosis.

The initial pharmacotherapy for Alzheimer's disease typically involves cholinesterase inhibitors, which increase the levels of acetylcholine in the brain. Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter involved in memory formation and learning. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine, work by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine, thereby increasing its availability in the synaptic cleft. This can help improve cognitive function, particularly memory, in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

The other options are not directly related to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease:

A. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter involved in anxiety and sleep regulation, but it is not a primary target for Alzheimer's disease treatment.

B. Serotonin is involved in mood regulation, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be used to treat depression, which is common in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, serotonin is not the primary target for treating the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

D. Dopamine is involved in motor control and reward processing, and dopamine replacement therapy is used to treat Parkinson's disease, not Alzheimer's disease.

E. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter involved in learning and memory, but it is not a primary target for Alzheimer's disease treatment. In fact, excessive glutamate release can be toxic to neurons and contribute to neurodegeneration.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Acetylcholine, as cholinesterase inhibitors are the initial pharmacotherapy of choice for Alzheimer's disease.",Success
"A 45-year-old mechanic presents to the emergency department complaining of acute-onset shortness of breath while repairing a plowing tractor for his neighbor. The patient denies having any history of asthma or respiratory symptoms, and does not smoke. His temperature is 99.8°F (37.7°C), pulse is 65/min, blood pressure is 126/86 mmHg, and respirations are 20/min. His oxygen saturation is 97%. On exam, he is pale and diaphoretic. His pupils are contracted. Diffuse wheezes are noted in all lung fields. What is the best treatment for his condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Atropine and pralidoxime.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is organophosphate poisoning, which is commonly seen in individuals exposed to pesticides or insecticides. The patient's occupation as a mechanic and the fact that he was repairing a plowing tractor suggest potential exposure to these substances.

The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath, wheezing, and contracted pupils, are consistent with cholinergic crisis, which is a hallmark of organophosphate poisoning. The treatment of choice for organophosphate poisoning is atropine, which is an anticholinergic medication that can help reverse the effects of the poisoning. Pralidoxime is an oxime that can reactivate acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that is inhibited by organophosphates, and is often given in conjunction with atropine.

Intubation (Option A) may be necessary if the patient's respiratory status deteriorates, but it is not the primary treatment for organophosphate poisoning. Succinylcholine (Option B) is a muscle relaxant that can exacerbate the muscle weakness associated with organophosphate poisoning and is contraindicated in this scenario. Inhaled ipratropium and oxygen (Option C) may help alleviate bronchospasm, but it is not a specific treatment for organophosphate poisoning. Inhaled albuterol and oxygen (Option E) may also help with bronchospasm, but it is not the primary treatment for this condition.

It's worth noting that the patient's symptoms and physical examination should prompt immediate attention and treatment, as organophosphate poisoning can be life-threatening if not treated promptly and appropriately.",Success
A 3-year-old male is brought in to his pediatrician by his mother because she is concerned that he is not growing appropriately. Physical examination is notable for frontal bossing and shortened upper and lower extremities. His axial skeleton appears normal. He is at the 7th percentile for height and 95th percentile for head circumference. He demonstrates normal intelligence and is able to speak in three-word sentences. He first sat up without support at twelve months and started walking at 24 months. Genetic analysis reveals an activating mutation in a growth factor receptor. Which of the following physiologic processes is most likely disrupted in this patient’s condition?,C,"The correct answer is C. Endochondral ossification.

The patient's physical examination findings, including frontal bossing, shortened upper and lower extremities, and normal axial skeleton, are consistent with achondroplasia, a genetic disorder affecting bone growth. The genetic analysis revealing an activating mutation in a growth factor receptor, specifically fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), further supports this diagnosis.

Achondroplasia is characterized by a disruption in endochondral ossification, which is the process by which cartilage templates are replaced by bone tissue. In this condition, the mutation in FGFR3 leads to abnormal signaling, resulting in premature closure of growth plates and shortened long bones.

Intramembranous ossification (Option A) is a process by which bone forms directly from mesenchymal tissue, without a cartilage template. While it is involved in the formation of certain bones, such as the cranial bones, it is not directly related to the patient's condition.

Osteoblast maturation (Option B) is important for bone formation, but it is not specifically disrupted in achondroplasia.

Production of type I collagen (Option D) is essential for bone formation, but it is not directly related to the patient's condition.

Bone resorption (Option E) is the process by which bone tissue is broken down, and it is not the primary disrupted process in achondroplasia.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Endochondral ossification.",Success
"A 59-year-old woman comes to the physician 2 weeks after noticing a lump in her left breast. Examination of the left breast shows a firm, nontender mass close to the nipple. Mammography shows an irregular calcified mass. A core needle biopsy shows invasive ductal carcinoma. Genetic analysis of this patient's cancer cells is most likely to show overexpression of which of the following genes?",A,"The correct answer is A. HER2.

Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common type of breast cancer, and it is often associated with overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene. HER2 is a proto-oncogene that plays a crucial role in the development and progression of breast cancer. Overexpression of HER2 is seen in approximately 20-30% of IDC cases and is associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and poorer prognosis.

The other options are not directly related to invasive ductal carcinoma or breast cancer:

* TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is often mutated in various types of cancer, including breast cancer. However, it is not specifically associated with overexpression in IDC.
* BCR-ABL is a fusion gene associated with chronic myeloid leukemia, not breast cancer.
* BRCA-2 is a tumor suppressor gene associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, but it is not typically overexpressed in IDC.
* BCL-2 is an anti-apoptotic gene that is often overexpressed in various types of cancer, including breast cancer. However, it is not as strongly associated with IDC as HER2.

According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, HER2 testing is recommended for all patients with invasive breast cancer, including IDC. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) also recommend HER2 testing for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",Success
"A 45-year-old man comes to his primary-care doctor with his wife for a 4-week history of constipation. The patient reports that his bowel habits have changed from every day to every 3 or 4 days. He also now has to strain to pass stool. On further questioning, his wife has also noticed that he has seemed fatigued, with little interest in going on their usual afternoon walks. Medical history is notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both managed medically. He was last seen for follow-up of these conditions 1 month ago. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the cellular target of the medicine that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is A. Angiotensin-II receptors in the membranes of vascular smooth muscle cells.

The patient's symptoms, particularly constipation and fatigue, suggest a possible side effect of a medication. Given the patient's medical history of hypertension, it is likely that the patient is taking an antihypertensive medication. The symptoms point to a medication that affects the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are commonly used to treat hypertension. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, while ARBs directly block the action of angiotensin II on its receptors.

Angiotensin II receptors are found on vascular smooth muscle cells, and their activation leads to vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. ARBs, such as losartan or valsartan, block these receptors, reducing blood pressure. However, a common side effect of ARBs is constipation, which is likely due to the inhibition of angiotensin II's stimulatory effect on the gut.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms:

B. Angiotensin-converting enzyme is the target of ACE inhibitors, which would also affect blood pressure but are less likely to cause constipation.

C. Calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells are targeted by calcium channel blockers, which are also used to treat hypertension but are not typically associated with constipation.

D. Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule is the target of thiazide diuretics, which are used to treat hypertension and edema but are not typically associated with constipation.

E. Na+/K+/2Cl- transporters in the ascending loop of Henle are targeted by loop diuretics, which are used to treat edema and hypertension but are not typically associated with constipation.

Therefore, the most likely culprit behind the patient's symptoms is an ARB, which targets angiotensin-II receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells.",Success
"A 23-year-old man presents to the office for a circular, itchy rash over the abdomen that has been slowly getting worse for the past 2 weeks.

He smokes one-half pack of cigarettes every day. His vital signs include: blood pressure 128/76 mm Hg, heart rate 78/min, and respirations 12/min. On physical examination, the patient appears tired but oriented. Examination of the skin reveals a 2 x 2 cm round and erythematous, annular plaque on the abdomen 3 cm to the left of the umbilicus. There are no vesicles, pustules, or papules. Auscultation of the heart reveals a 1/6 systolic murmur. Breath sounds are mildly coarse at the bases. A KOH preparation from the skin scraping confirms the presence of hyphae. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Itraconazole.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a diagnosis of tinea corporis, a fungal infection of the skin. The presence of hyphae on the KOH preparation confirms this diagnosis. Itraconazole is an antifungal medication that is effective in treating tinea corporis.

Topical clobetasol (Option C) is a corticosteroid that may be used to reduce inflammation and itching associated with tinea corporis, but it does not treat the underlying fungal infection.

Griseofulvin (Option B) is an antifungal medication, but it is primarily used to treat fungal infections of the scalp, skin, and nails, such as ringworm. It is not the first-line treatment for tinea corporis.

Topical clindamycin (Option D) is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections, not fungal infections.

Doxycycline (Option E) is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections, such as sinusitis, which the patient has a history of. However, it is not effective against fungal infections like tinea corporis.

According to current medical guidelines, itraconazole is a recommended treatment for tinea corporis. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends oral antifungal therapy, such as itraconazole, for the treatment of tinea corporis.",Success
"A 12-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of persistent bleeding from his nose over the past hour. The bleeding started spontaneously. He has no history of a similar episode. He takes no medications. There is no history of abnormal bleeding in the family. His vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, he is pressing a gauze against his left nostril while hyperextending his head. The gauze is stained with blood and upon withdrawal of the gauze blood slowly drips out of his left nostrils. There is no bleeding from the right nostril. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial therapy?",E,"The correct answer is E. Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.

Here's why:

The patient is experiencing a common and usually benign condition known as epistaxis, or nosebleed. The majority of nosebleeds in children are anterior, meaning they occur in the front of the nose, and are often caused by dry air, allergies, or minor trauma.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that initial management of epistaxis in children should focus on applying direct pressure to the nostrils. This can be done by squeezing the nostrils manually for 5-10 minutes, with the head elevated to reduce blood flow to the nose. This approach is often successful in stopping the bleeding.

The other options are not the most appropriate initial therapy for several reasons:

A. Anterior packing and topical antibiotics may be necessary if the bleeding doesn't stop with manual pressure, but it's not the first line of treatment.

B. Oxymetazoline nasal spray is a vasoconstrictor that can help reduce bleeding, but it's not as effective as manual pressure, and its use should be limited to 3-5 days to avoid rebound congestion.

C. Epinephrine gauze is not a recommended treatment for epistaxis in children.

D. Silver nitrate cauterization is a more invasive procedure that's typically reserved for recurrent or severe bleeding, and is not necessary for a first-time, uncomplicated episode of epistaxis.

In summary, manual pressure to the nostrils with the head elevated is the most appropriate initial therapy for this patient, as recommended by the AAP.",Success
"A 40-year-old female presents to your office complaining of a tender neck and general lethargy. Upon further questioning, she reports decreased appetite, fatigue, constipation, and jaw pain. Her pulse is 60 bpm and her blood pressure is 130/110 mm Hg. Biopsy of her thyroid reveals granulomatous inflammation and multinucleate giant cells surrounding fragmented colloid. Which of the following likely precipitated the patient’s condition:",D,"The correct answer is D. Infection.

The patient's symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with subacute thyroiditis, also known as de Quervain's thyroiditis. This is a self-limiting inflammatory disorder of the thyroid gland, often triggered by a viral infection. The granulomatous inflammation and multinucleate giant cells surrounding fragmented colloid on biopsy are characteristic findings of subacute thyroiditis.

The other options are not likely to precipitate this condition:

A. Iodine deficiency can lead to goiter (enlargement of the thyroid gland), but it is not typically associated with granulomatous inflammation and multinucleate giant cells.

B. Goitrogens are substances that interfere with thyroid function, but they do not typically cause granulomatous inflammation.

C. A thyroglossal duct cyst is a congenital anomaly that can cause a neck mass, but it is not associated with granulomatous inflammation or multinucleate giant cells.

E. Chronic renal disease can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, which can affect the thyroid gland, but it is not typically associated with granulomatous inflammation and multinucleate giant cells.

"A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by the police after a fall. The patient smells of alcohol and is slurring his words. You find out that he has recently been fired from his job as a salesperson for months of tardiness and poor performance. The police tell you that his girlfriend, who was there at the time of the fall, mentioned that the patient has been struggling with alcohol for at least a year. Upon physical examination, the patient becomes agitated and starts yelling. He accuses his ex-boss of being a cocaine addict and says he couldn’t keep up sales percentages compared to someone using cocaine. Which of the following psychiatric defense mechanisms is the patient demonstrating?",C,"The correct answer is C. Projection.

Projection is a defense mechanism in which an individual attributes their own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or impulses to someone else. In this scenario, the patient accuses his ex-boss of being a cocaine addict, which is an unsubstantiated claim. This behavior is a classic example of projection, as the patient is attributing his own struggles with substance abuse (alcohol) to someone else.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Denial: Denial involves refusing to acknowledge or accept an uncomfortable reality. While the patient may be in denial about his own substance abuse issues, the specific behavior described in the question is not an example of denial.

B. Displacement: Displacement involves redirecting emotions or impulses from the original source to a more acceptable or less threatening target. In this scenario, the patient's anger and frustration are not being redirected to someone else; instead, he is accusing someone else of having a problem similar to his own.

D. Rationalization: Rationalization involves creating a logical explanation to justify one's behavior. The patient's behavior is not an attempt to justify his own actions, but rather to shift the focus away from his own substance abuse issues.

E. Regression: Regression involves reverting to a earlier stage of development or behavior in response to stress or anxiety. While the patient's behavior may be immature or childish, it is not an example of regression.

It's essential to recognize defense mechanisms like projection, as they can provide insight into a patient's underlying psychological dynamics and inform treatment approaches.",Success

Ring-form trophozoites are absent on the peripheral blood smear. Which of the following organisms is the most likely cause of this patient’s illness?",B,"The correct answer is B. Chikungunya virus.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Chikungunya virus infection. The key features that point to this diagnosis are:

1. Travel history: The patient recently returned from Africa, where Chikungunya virus is endemic.
2. Fever: The patient had a severe fever (40℃ or 104℉) for 3 days, which is consistent with Chikungunya virus infection.
3. Rash: The patient developed a maculopapular rash over the trunk and extremities, which is a common feature of Chikungunya virus infection.
4. Arthritis: The patient has painful wrists, fingers, and ankles, which is a hallmark of Chikungunya virus infection. The virus can cause severe joint pain and swelling, especially in the hands and feet.
5. Laboratory results: The patient's complete blood count (CBC) shows a mild anemia, a normal platelet count, and a mild leukopenia, which is consistent with Chikungunya virus infection.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following reasons:

A. Babesia babesia: This parasite causes babesiosis, which typically presents with fever, chills, and hemolytic anemia. The patient's CBC does not show evidence of hemolysis, and the symptoms are not consistent with babesiosis.

C. Dengue virus: While dengue fever can cause fever, rash, and joint pain, it typically presents with a more severe hemorrhagic component, which is not seen in this patient.

D. Leishmania major: This parasite causes cutaneous leishmaniasis, which typically presents with skin lesions, fever, and lymphadenopathy. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with cutaneous leishmaniasis.

E. Tropheryma whipplei: This bacterium causes Whipple's disease, which is a rare condition that typically presents with gastrointestinal symptoms, fever, and weight loss. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with Whipple's disease.

You begin to review his labs and notice and he has elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate, ammonia, and lactate. What would be the appropriate response to the patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Accept the patient's wishes and ensure he receives appropriate care.

Here's why:

The patient is experiencing a life-threatening emergency, specifically a gastrointestinal bleed, which requires immediate attention. Despite his past medical history, the patient has expressed a clear desire to receive treatment and wants everything done to save his life. As a healthcare provider, it is essential to respect the patient's autonomy and prioritize their wishes.

The patient's labs suggest that he may be experiencing metabolic acidosis (elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate and lactate) and possible hepatic encephalopathy (elevated ammonia), which further emphasizes the need for prompt medical attention.

The other options are not appropriate in this scenario:

A. Consulting an ethics committee may be necessary in cases where there is uncertainty or conflict about a patient's wishes, but in this case, the patient has clearly expressed their desire for treatment.

B. The absence of a written request (e.g., advance directive) does not preclude the patient from receiving treatment. Verbal consent is sufficient in emergency situations.

C. A psych evaluation may be necessary if there are concerns about the patient's mental capacity to make decisions, but this is not the primary concern in this scenario.

E. Obtaining an emergency order from a judge is not necessary, as the patient has already provided verbal consent for treatment.

The lungs are clear to auscultation. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Compression ultrasonography.

Here's why:

The patient presents with swelling of the right leg, which is a common symptom of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Although the patient does not have pain, which is often associated with DVT, it's still a possibility. The absence of erythema, pitting edema, and a negative Homan's sign do not rule out DVT.

Given the patient's recent surgery, immobility, and possible hypercoagulability due to pancreatic cancer, DVT is a high-risk complication. Compression ultrasonography is a non-invasive, widely available, and sensitive test for diagnosing DVT in the proximal veins (femoral and popliteal).

While CT pulmonary angiography (Option A) is used to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE), which can be a complication of DVT, it's not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. The patient doesn't have symptoms suggestive of PE, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or tachycardia.

Vancomycin therapy (Option C) is not indicated, as there is no evidence of infection or sepsis.

D-dimer level (Option D) can be elevated in DVT, but it's a non-specific test and can be influenced by various factors, including surgery and cancer. It's not a reliable diagnostic test for DVT.

Two sets of blood cultures (Option E) are not necessary, as there is no evidence of sepsis or infection.

If taken in high doses, which of the following are the most likely side effects of the drug?",A,"The correct answer is D. Pedal edema and flushing.

The description of the drug suggests that it is a class I anti-arrhythmic, specifically flecainide. Flecainide is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers, blocks potassium channels, and prolongs action potential duration. It also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity.

The most likely side effects of flecainide, especially at high doses, are pedal edema and flushing. This is due to its alpha-blocking activity, which can cause vasodilation and lead to peripheral edema and flushing.

He drinks 10–12 beers daily and has not seen a physician in 15 years. He appears pale. His temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 122/min, and blood pressure is 85/59 mm Hg. Physical examination shows decreased radial pulses, delayed capillary refill, multiple spider angiomata, and a distended abdomen. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. Which of the following is most likely decreased in this patient in response to his current condition compared to a healthy adult?",C,"The correct answer is A. Systemic vascular resistance.

Let's break down the patient's presentation and physiology to justify this choice:

The patient is experiencing hypovolemic shock due to recurrent vomiting, which has led to dehydration and blood loss. This is evident from his pale appearance, tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased radial pulses. The patient's distended abdomen suggests possible portal hypertension, which is common in patients with chronic liver disease, as hinted by the presence of spider angiomata.

In response to hypovolemic shock, the body's compensatory mechanisms aim to increase blood pressure and maintain perfusion to vital organs. One of these mechanisms is the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which increases systemic vascular resistance (SVR) to redirect blood flow to the core. However, in this patient, the SVR is likely decreased due to the following reasons:

1. Dehydration and blood loss lead to a decrease in blood volume, which reduces the effectiveness of vasoconstriction.
2. Chronic liver disease can cause vasodilation and decreased SVR due to the release of vasodilators, such as nitric oxide.
3. The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest that the body's compensatory mechanisms are failing, leading to a decrease in SVR.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's current condition:

B. Fractional tissue oxygen extraction might be increased in response to hypovolemic shock, as the body tries to extract more oxygen from the available blood flow.

C. Carotid baroreceptor firing activity would increase in response to hypotension, triggering a compensatory increase in sympathetic activity.

D. Pulmonary vascular resistance is not directly related to the patient's current condition.

E. Cardiac inotropy might be decreased due to the patient's hypovolemic shock and potential cardiac dysfunction, but this is not the most likely answer based on the provided information.

In summary, the patient's hypovolemic shock and chronic liver disease have likely led to a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, making option A the most correct answer.",Success
"A 69-year-old male with a longstanding history of hypertension and high cholesterol presents with abdominal pain and ‘bruising on his feet’. The patient states that his symptoms started about a week ago and have steadily worsened. He describes the abdominal pain as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The cardiac exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Carotid bruit present on the right. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds present. A pulsatile abdominal mass is felt in the lower umbilical region. Patient’s feet have the following appearance seen in the picture. Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm). High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are initiated. Morphine sulfate and metoprolol are administered. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?
 ",E,"The correct answer is C. Elective endovascular repair.

Here's why:

The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), which is confirmed by abdominal ultrasound and contrast CT. The AAA is small, measuring 4.1 cm in diameter, and is unruptured. The patient's symptoms, such as abdominal pain and ""bruising on his feet,"" are likely related to the aneurysm.

According to current medical guidelines, the recommended treatment for a small, unruptured AAA (<5.5 cm in diameter) is elective repair, either through endovascular repair (EVAR) or open surgical repair. The decision between EVAR and open surgical repair depends on various factors, including the patient's overall health, aneurysm morphology, and surgeon preference.

In this case, the patient is 69 years old, has a history of hypertension, high cholesterol, and smoking, which increases his risk for cardiovascular complications. However, he is otherwise stable, and his symptoms are manageable. Elective endovascular repair (Option C) is a suitable choice, as it is a minimally invasive procedure with lower perioperative morbidity and mortality rates compared to open surgical repair.

Discharging the patient with clinical surveillance and annual or semiannual ultrasound (Options A and B) is not recommended, as the aneurysm may continue to grow and rupture, leading to a life-threatening emergency.

Emergency open surgical repair (Option E) is not necessary, as the aneurysm is unruptured, and the patient's symptoms are manageable. Elective open surgical repair (Option D) may be considered, but EVAR is generally preferred due to its less invasive nature.

In summary, the best course of treatment for this patient is elective endovascular repair (Option C), which offers a minimally invasive approach to managing the small, unruptured AAA while minimizing perioperative risks.",Success
"A 38-year-old woman undergoes a partial thyroidectomy for an enlarged thyroid gland compressing the trachea. During surgery, a young surgeon ligates the inferior thyroid arteries as close to the poles as possible to prevent intraoperative hemorrhage. 2 weeks later, the patient presents to the outpatient clinic with hoarseness. What could be the most likely cause of her hoarseness?",B,"The correct answer is B. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.

Here's why:

During a partial thyroidectomy, the inferior thyroid arteries are ligated to prevent bleeding. However, the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is located in close proximity to the inferior thyroid artery, particularly near the ligament of Berry. If the artery is ligated too close to the thyroid gland, there is a risk of injuring the RLN.

The RLN is responsible for innervating the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, which control vocal cord function. Injury to the RLN can result in hoarseness, vocal cord paralysis, or weakness. In this scenario, the patient's hoarseness 2 weeks post-surgery suggests a possible RLN injury.

The other options are less likely:

A. Internal laryngeal nerve injury: The internal laryngeal nerve is responsible for sensory innervation of the larynx and is not directly related to vocal cord function or hoarseness.

C. Phrenic nerve damage: The phrenic nerve is responsible for diaphragmatic function and is not typically affected during thyroid surgery.

D. External laryngeal nerve injury: The external laryngeal nerve is responsible for innervating the cricothyroid muscle, which helps to tense the vocal cords. While injury to this nerve can cause voice changes, it is less likely to cause hoarseness compared to RLN injury.

E. Laryngeal edema: Laryngeal edema is possible after thyroid surgery, but it would typically present with stridor, dyspnea, or airway obstruction, rather than isolated hoarseness.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American Thyroid Association, emphasize the importance of identifying and preserving the RLN during thyroid surgery to minimize the risk of nerve injury and subsequent hoarseness.",Success
"A 17-year-old man presents to his family physician for an evaluation about the size of his penis. He feels increasingly anxious during physical education (PE) class as he has noticed that the size of his penis is significantly smaller when compared to his peers. Based on the physical examination, he is Tanner stage 1. The weight and height are 60 kg (132 lb) and 175 cm (5 ft 9 in), respectively. The cardiopulmonary examination is normal; however, the patient has difficulty identifying coffee grounds by smell. Which of the following explains the pathophysiology underlying this patient’s disorder?",B,"The correct answer is B. Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation suggests hypogonadism, which is supported by his Tanner stage 1, indicating a lack of pubertal development. The patient's height and weight are within normal range, ruling out any significant growth hormone deficiency or malnutrition.

The key finding that points to the diagnosis is the patient's difficulty identifying coffee grounds by smell. This suggests a defect in the olfactory system, which is closely related to the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis.

Isolated GnRH deficiency, also known as Kallmann syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (low levels of sex hormones due to insufficient GnRH production) and anosmia (loss of smell). This condition is often associated with a deficiency in GnRH, which is necessary for the development and regulation of the HPG axis.

The other options do not fit the patient's presentation:

A. Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat is associated with myotonic dystrophy, a muscular dystrophy disorder.

C. Sex-specific epigenetic imprinting is related to Prader-Willi syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by short stature, hypotonia, and hyperphagia.

D. Leptin receptor mutation is associated with obesity and metabolic disorders.

E. Non-disjunction of sex chromosomes is related to chromosomal abnormalities, such as Klinefelter syndrome or Turner syndrome, which do not fit the patient's presentation.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination, isolated GnRH deficiency (Kallmann syndrome) is the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 63-year-old man is aiming to improve his health by eating a well balanced diet, walking daily, and quitting smoking following a 45-year smoking history. While on his daily walks he notices a strong cramping pain in his calves that consistently appears after a mile of walking. He sees his physician and a diagnosis of peripheral artery disease with intermittent claudication is made. To improve his symptoms, cilostazol is prescribed. What is the mechanism of action of this medication?",E,"The correct answer is E. Phosphodiesterase inhibitor.

Cilostazol is a medication used to treat intermittent claudication, a symptom of peripheral artery disease (PAD). Its mechanism of action is as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, specifically a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor. By inhibiting PDE3, cilostazol increases the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in platelets and blood vessels, leading to:

1. Inhibition of platelet aggregation: Reduced platelet aggregation decreases the risk of thrombus formation, which can exacerbate PAD.
2. Vasodilation: Increased cAMP levels in blood vessels cause smooth muscle relaxation, leading to vasodilation and improved blood flow to the affected areas, such as the calf muscles.
3. Anti-inflammatory effects: Cilostazol also has anti-inflammatory properties, which may contribute to its therapeutic effects in PAD.

The other options are not correct:

A. Irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor: This is the mechanism of action of aspirin, not cilostazol.

B. Glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitor: This is the mechanism of action of antiplatelet medications like abciximab, not cilostazol.

C. Thromboxane synthase inhibitor: This is the mechanism of action of medications like dazoxiben, not cilostazol.

D. Adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor: This is the mechanism of action of medications like clopidogrel, not cilostazol.

It's essential to note that cilostazol is not a first-line treatment for PAD, and lifestyle modifications, such as smoking cessation and regular exercise, should be prioritized. However, cilostazol can be a useful adjunctive therapy to improve symptoms and functional capacity in patients with intermittent claudication.",Success
"A 37-year-old man comes to the emergency department with the chief complaint of a high fever for several days. In addition to the fever, he has had malaise, chest pain, and a dry cough. He recently went on vacation to South America but has returned to his job delivering packages. He has several friends who recently had influenza. Hi temperature is 102.8°F (39.3 °C), blood pressure is 137/80 mmHg, pulse is 104/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98%. Chest exam reveals a deep noise found bilaterally in the lung bases. Chest radiograph reveals a wider area of opacity near the heart and bilateral lung infiltrates. Which of the following is characteristic of the most likely organism responsible for this patient's symptoms?",C,"The correct answer is B. Cultured on charcoal and yeast.

Based on the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings, the most likely organism responsible for this patient's symptoms is Legionella pneumophila, which causes Legionnaires' disease. Legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative bacterium that requires charcoal and yeast extract for growth in culture, hence option B is the correct answer.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Captain's wheel appearance is a characteristic of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, not Legionella pneumophila.

C. D-glutamate capsule is a characteristic of Bacillus anthracis, not Legionella pneumophila.

D. Found in desert sand is a characteristic of Coccidioides immitis, a fungus that causes Valley fever, not Legionella pneumophila.

E. Polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate capsule is a characteristic of Haemophilus influenzae, not Legionella pneumophila.

Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila, which is typically acquired through inhalation of contaminated aerosols or water droplets. The patient's symptoms, including fever, malaise, chest pain, and dry cough, are consistent with Legionnaires' disease. The chest radiograph findings of bilateral lung infiltrates and a wider area of opacity near the heart also support this diagnosis.",Success

At the hospital, the vital signs include: temperature 40.0°C (104.0°F), blood pressure 140/80 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, and respiratory rate 28/min. On physical exam, he is thin and poorly kept. His clothes appear dirty. Small scars are visible in the decubitus region of both arms. The lung sounds are equal with bilateral crackles, and heart auscultation reveals a systolic murmur that radiates to the left axilla. Petechiae are seen on the hard palate and palms of his hands. A chest X-ray and blood cultures are ordered. What is the most likely organism causing his symptoms?",C,"The correct answer is C. Staphylococcus aureus.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain, are consistent with a severe respiratory infection, likely pneumonia. The presence of bilateral crackles on lung exam and the chest X-ray findings (not specified in the question, but likely showing infiltrates or consolidation) support this diagnosis.

The patient's physical appearance, including small scars on his arms, suggests a history of intravenous drug use. The presence of petechiae on the hard palate and palms of his hands is a significant finding, as it indicates a possible endocarditis (infection of the heart valves).

Given the patient's history of IV drug use and the presence of petechiae, the most likely organism causing his symptoms is Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureus is a common cause of both pneumonia and endocarditis, especially in IV drug users. The systolic murmur radiating to the left axilla also supports the diagnosis of endocarditis.

While Streptococci viridans (A) can cause endocarditis, it is less likely in this case given the patient's history of IV drug use and the presence of petechiae. Enterococci (B) can also cause endocarditis, but it is less common than S. aureus in IV drug users. Aspergillus fumigatus (D) is a fungus that can cause pneumonia, but it is less likely in this case given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings. Staphylococcus epidermidis (E) is a common skin flora that can cause infections, but it is less likely to cause pneumonia and endocarditis in this scenario.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), recommend considering S. aureus as a potential cause of pneumonia and endocarditis in IV drug users.",Success

Physical exam reveals pallor and perspiration but is otherwise unremarkable. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is produced by cells located in which region of the histology slide shown in figure A?",E,"Based on the patient's symptoms, the most likely cause is a pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that produces excessive amounts of catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine.

The histology slide shown in figure A is likely a section of the adrenal gland. Given the patient's symptoms and the location of the tumor, the correct answer is:

C. Adrenal medulla

Here's why:

* Pheochromocytomas arise from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, which is the inner region of the adrenal gland responsible for producing catecholamines.
* The adrenal medulla is the region where the chromaffin cells are located, and it is the most likely site for a pheochromocytoma to develop.

She has never had anything like this happen before. Her general physical exam is unremarkable. Her neurologic exam is notable for loss of vision in the right visual field of both eyes with macular sparing, though extraocular movements are intact. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head shows no acute intracranial process. Angiography of the brain will most likely show a lesion in which of the following vessels?",D,"The correct answer is D. Posterior cerebral artery.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and exam findings are consistent with a posterior cerebral artery (PCA) occlusion. The key features that point to this diagnosis are:

1. Sudden onset of vision loss in the right visual field of both eyes (bilateral homonymous hemianopia) with macular sparing. This is a classic presentation of PCA occlusion, as the PCA supplies the visual cortex responsible for the contralateral visual field.
2. Normal extraocular movements, which suggests that the cranial nerves responsible for eye movement (III, IV, and VI) are intact, making a brainstem or cranial nerve lesion less likely.
3. The absence of other significant neurologic deficits, such as weakness, numbness, or aphasia, which would be expected with occlusions of other major cerebral arteries (e.g., middle cerebral artery or anterior cerebral artery).

The posterior cerebral artery is a branch of the basilar artery and supplies the occipital lobe, which is responsible for processing visual information. An occlusion of the PCA would result in the described visual field defect.

While an internal carotid artery occlusion could also cause visual symptoms, the bilateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing is more characteristic of a PCA occlusion. The anterior cerebral artery and middle cerebral artery are less likely to cause isolated visual field defects without other associated neurologic symptoms. The basilar artery is a larger vessel that supplies the posterior circulation, but an occlusion of the basilar artery would typically cause more widespread neurologic deficits, including brainstem signs and symptoms.",Success
"A three-day-old, full-term infant born by uncomplicated vaginal delivery is brought to a pediatrician by his mother, who notes that her son's skin appears yellow. She reports that the child cries several times per day, but sleeps 7-8 hours at night, uninterrupted. She has been breastfeeding the infant but feels the latch has been poor and is unsure how much milk he has been consuming but feels it is not enough. A lactation consult was called for the patient and it was noted that despite proper instruction the observed latch was still poor. When asked the mother stated that the baby is currently making stools 2 times per day. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's presentation?",B,"The correct answer is B. Breastfeeding jaundice.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation is consistent with breastfeeding jaundice, which is a common condition in newborns. The infant is three days old, which is within the typical timeframe for breastfeeding jaundice to develop. The mother reports a poor latch, which can lead to inadequate milk intake and subsequent jaundice. The fact that the infant is having only 2 stools per day suggests that milk intake may be insufficient.

Breastfeeding jaundice is caused by inadequate milk intake, which leads to a buildup of bilirubin in the blood. This is often due to a poor latch, inadequate milk supply, or other breastfeeding difficulties. The symptoms are typically mild and resolve once the breastfeeding issues are addressed.

In contrast, breast milk jaundice (option A) typically occurs later, around 7-10 days of age, and is caused by a substance in breast milk that inhibits the breakdown of bilirubin.

Crigler-Najjar syndrome (option D) is a rare genetic disorder that affects bilirubin metabolism, but it is not a likely cause of jaundice in a healthy, full-term infant.

Sepsis (option C) is a serious infection that can cause jaundice, but there are no other symptoms or signs of infection in this patient.

Physiologic hyperbilirubinemia (option E) is a normal, transient increase in bilirubin levels that occurs in many newborns. However, it typically peaks around 3-5 days of age and resolves by 7-10 days. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with breastfeeding jaundice.

Overall, the patient's presentation, including the poor latch, inadequate milk intake, and mild symptoms, points to breastfeeding jaundice as the most likely etiology.",Success

Which of the following is a feature of this patient condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. It is a diagnosis of exclusion.

The patient's presentation, including black, tarry stools, jaundice, lethargy, asterixis, and guaiac-positive stool, suggests hepatic encephalopathy (HE). HE is a complication of liver cirrhosis, characterized by altered mental status, asterixis, and other neurological symptoms.

Option C is correct because hepatic encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion. This means that other potential causes of altered mental status, such as infection, electrolyte imbalance, or other metabolic disorders, must be ruled out before making a diagnosis of HE.

Option A is incorrect because HE carries a poor prognosis, especially if left untreated. Option B is incorrect because while ammonia levels may be elevated in HE, they are not a reliable diagnostic test, and other causes of elevated ammonia levels must be excluded. Option D is incorrect because while cirrhosis is a common underlying condition, HE can also occur in patients with other liver diseases or acute liver failure.

"A 20-year-old healthy man is running on a treadmill for the last 30 minutes. He is in good shape and exercises 3 times per week. He takes no medications and denies smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and illicit drug use. Prior to starting his run, his heart rate was 70/min, and the blood pressure was 114/74 mm Hg. Immediately after stopping his run, the heart rate is 130/min, and the blood pressure is 145/75 mm Hg. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the change in his heart rate and blood pressure?",D,"The correct answer is D. Sympathetic nervous system activation.

Here's why:

During exercise, the body's ""fight or flight"" response is triggered, leading to activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The SNS releases catecholamines, such as norepinephrine and epinephrine, which cause an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. This response is necessary to meet the increased oxygen and energy demands of the exercising muscles.

In this scenario, the patient's heart rate increased from 70/min to 130/min, and the blood pressure increased from 114/74 mm Hg to 145/75 mm Hg, indicating an increase in cardiac output and peripheral resistance. This is consistent with SNS activation.

The other options are not directly responsible for the changes in heart rate and blood pressure:

A. Baroreceptor reflex: This reflex helps to regulate blood pressure by sensing changes in arterial pressure and sending signals to the brain to adjust heart rate and vasodilation/vasoconstriction. While the baroreceptor reflex is active during exercise, it would not cause an increase in heart rate and blood pressure.

B. Increased activation of the vagal nuclei: The vagus nerve is responsible for parasympathetic activity, which would decrease heart rate and blood pressure, not increase them.

C. Increased aldosterone production: Aldosterone is a hormone that regulates electrolyte balance and blood volume. While it can affect blood pressure, it is not directly responsible for the acute changes seen in this scenario.

E. Vasopressin release from the pituitary: Vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), helps regulate water reabsorption in the kidneys. While it can affect blood pressure, it is not directly responsible for the changes seen in this scenario.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Sympathetic nervous system activation.",Success

Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory tests are unremarkable. Plain radiographs of the right hip joint are significant for displacement of the right femoral head inferoposterior off the femoral neck. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of treatment for this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Surgical pinning of the right hip.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including the limited range of motion, external rotation of the right leg, and displacement of the femoral head on radiographs, are consistent with a diagnosis of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). SCFE is a common condition in adolescents, particularly those who are obese, where the epiphyseal plate of the femoral head slips, resulting in a displacement of the femoral head from the femoral neck.

The treatment of SCFE typically involves surgical intervention to stabilize the femoral head and prevent further slippage. Surgical pinning of the right hip is the most appropriate course of treatment in this case. This procedure involves placing one or more pins across the growth plate to stabilize the femoral head and promote healing.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Reassessing in 3 months would delay treatment and potentially allow for further slippage of the femoral head, leading to increased risk of complications such as avascular necrosis.

B. Immobilizing the right knee with conservative treatment would not address the underlying condition and may not provide adequate stabilization of the femoral head.

C. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection is not a recommended treatment for SCFE, as it would not address the underlying mechanical issue.

D. A Pavlik harness is used to treat developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in infants, not SCFE in adolescents.

It is essential to prioritize prompt surgical intervention in this case to prevent long-term complications and ensure optimal outcomes for the patient.",Success

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?",A,"The correct answer is A. Leydig cell tumor.

Here's why:

The patient presents with bilateral gynecomastia, which is a common symptom of hormonal imbalance, specifically an increase in estrogen levels. The presence of a non-tender mass in the left testis, which is not transilluminable, suggests a solid tumor. Leydig cell tumors are rare benign tumors that arise from the interstitial cells of the testes, which produce androgens. However, some Leydig cell tumors can also produce estrogen, leading to gynecomastia.

The patient's history of testicular trauma 3 months prior to the development of gynecomastia is a red herring. Trauma to the testis (option E) is unlikely to cause gynecomastia.

Obesity (option B) can cause gynecomastia due to the aromatization of androgens to estrogens in adipose tissue. However, the presence of a testicular mass points towards a more specific underlying cause.

Thyroid disease (option C) can cause gynecomastia, but it is less likely in this scenario given the presence of a testicular mass.

Klinefelter syndrome (option D) is a genetic disorder that can cause gynecomastia, but it is typically associated with other features such as tall stature, small testes, and infertility, which are not mentioned in this patient's history.

In summary, the combination of bilateral gynecomastia and a non-tender testicular mass makes Leydig cell tumor the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms.",Success

Nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) testing is a non-invasive, in-office procedure that measures the patient's erectile function during sleep. It is a useful diagnostic tool to distinguish between psychological and organic causes of ED. NPT testing can help identify whether the patient is experiencing nocturnal erections, which would suggest a psychological or relationship-related cause, or if he is not experiencing nocturnal erections, which would suggest an organic cause.

The other options are not the most appropriate next step in management:

A. Psychotherapy may be beneficial for addressing psychological factors contributing to ED, but it is not the next step in evaluating the underlying cause of ED.

B. Penile prosthesis insertion is a surgical intervention that is typically reserved for patients who have failed other treatments or have severe ED.

C. Intracavernous prostaglandin E1 injections are a treatment option for ED, but they should not be initiated without first evaluating the underlying cause of ED.

E. Switching citalopram to bupropion may be considered if the patient's depressive symptoms are not well-controlled, but it is not directly related to evaluating the cause of ED.

Therefore, nocturnal penile tumescence testing is the most appropriate next step in management to help determine the underlying cause of this patient's erectile dysfunction.",Success
"A 5-year-old male presents to the pediatrician with a 10-day history of cough that is worse at night. The patient has a history of mild intermittent asthma and has been using his albuterol inhaler without relief. He has also been complaining of headache and sore throat, and his mother has noticed worsening rhinorrhea. The patient’s past medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and he has no known drug allergies. In the office, his temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 88/65 mmHg, pulse is 132/min, and respirations are 16/min. The patient has purulent mucus draining from the nares, and his face is tender to palpation over the maxillary sinuses. His pharynx is erythematous with symmetric swelling of the tonsils. On lung exam, he has moderate bilateral expiratory wheezing.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of acute sinusitis, likely caused by a bacterial infection. The presence of purulent mucus draining from the nares, facial tenderness over the maxillary sinuses, and fever support this diagnosis.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for acute bacterial sinusitis in children recommend amoxicillin-clavulanic acid as the first-line treatment. This is because the clavulanic acid component helps to combat beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, which are commonly found in sinus infections.

Amoxicillin alone (Option A) may not be effective against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, which are often resistant to amoxicillin.

Ampicillin-sulbactam (Option C) is not typically used for sinus infections in children.

Clindamycin (Option D) is not a recommended first-line treatment for sinusitis in children, as it has limited activity against Haemophilus influenzae, a common pathogen in sinus infections.

Levofloxacin (Option E) is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is not recommended for use in children due to concerns about its potential effects on cartilage development.

In summary, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is the best next step in management for this patient, as it is the recommended first-line treatment for acute bacterial sinusitis in children.",Success
"A 65-year-old man, known to have chronic obstructive lung disease for the last 3 years, presents to the emergency department with a cough, breathing difficulty, and increased expectoration for a day. There is no history of fever. His regular medications include inhaled salmeterol and inhaled fluticasone propionate. He was a chronic smoker but quit smoking 2 years ago. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), the pulse rate is 88/min, the blood pressure is 128/86 mm Hg, and the respirations are 30/min. On physical examination, the use of the accessory muscles of respiration is evident and the arterial saturation of oxygen is 87%. Auscultation of the chest reveals the presence of bilateral rhonchi with diminished breath sounds in both lungs. Which of the following medications, if administered for the next 2 weeks, is most likely to reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations over the next 6 months?",B,"The correct answer is B. Oral prednisone.

Here's why:

The patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), characterized by increased cough, breathing difficulty, and expectoration. The use of accessory muscles of respiration and bilateral rhonchi with diminished breath sounds in both lungs support this diagnosis.

Oral prednisone is a glucocorticoid that has been shown to reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations in patients with COPD. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 2018 found that systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone, reduced the risk of COPD exacerbations and improved lung function in patients with COPD. The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines also recommend the use of systemic corticosteroids for 7-14 days in patients with COPD exacerbations.

The other options are not supported by evidence for reducing the risk of subsequent exacerbations:

A. Oral theophylline is a bronchodilator that may help relieve symptoms, but it has not been shown to reduce the risk of exacerbations.

C. Supplemental oxygen is essential for patients with COPD who have hypoxemia, but it does not reduce the risk of exacerbations.

D. Montelukast is a leukotriene modifier used in asthma, not COPD, and has no role in reducing COPD exacerbations.

E. Nebulized N-acetylcysteine is a mucolytic agent that may help loosen mucus, but it has not been shown to reduce the risk of COPD exacerbations.

In summary, oral prednisone is the most likely medication to reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations over the next 6 months in this patient with COPD.",Success
"A 22-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for abdominal pain. The patient has been trying to get pregnant and was successful recently, but now she is experiencing abdominal pain, contractions, and a bloody vaginal discharge. According to her last appointment with her primary care provider, she is 10 weeks pregnant. The patient has a past medical history of constipation, anxiety, and substance abuse. She is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a bloody vaginal discharge and an open cervix. The patient is initially extremely grateful for the care she is receiving and thanks the doctor and the nursing staff for saving her baby. Upon hearing the news that she is having a spontaneous abortion, the patient becomes angry and aggressive and states that her physician and the medical staff are incompetent, evil, and she is going to sue all of them. The patient is left to grieve but upon entering the room again you notice that the patient has new lacerations over her wrists and that some of the medical equipment in the room is broken. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Borderline personality disorder.

The patient's behavior, as described, is consistent with the diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD). Specifically:

1. Emotional dysregulation: The patient's rapid shift from gratitude to anger and aggression in response to the news of her spontaneous abortion suggests emotional instability and intense emotional reactivity.
2. Impulsivity: The patient's self-harming behavior, as evidenced by the new lacerations on her wrists, is a hallmark feature of BPD.
3. Interpersonal difficulties: The patient's sudden and intense anger towards the medical staff, accompanied by threats of lawsuits, indicates difficulties with interpersonal relationships and a tendency to idealize or devalue others.
4. Self-destructive behavior: The patient's self-harming behavior and potential destruction of medical equipment suggest a pattern of self-destructive behavior.

While acute stress response (A) may contribute to the patient's emotional reactivity, it does not fully explain the patient's impulsive and self-destructive behavior. Antisocial personality disorder (B) is characterized by a lack of empathy and impulsivity, but it does not typically involve the intense emotional reactivity and self-destructive behavior seen in this patient. A normal grief response (D) would not typically involve self-harming behavior or destruction of property. Post-traumatic stress disorder (E) may be a possibility, but it would require a specific traumatic event, and the patient's behavior is more consistent with BPD.

It's essential to note that a definitive diagnosis of BPD requires a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation and should not be made solely based on this encounter. However, the patient's behavior is highly suggestive of BPD, and further evaluation and management by a mental health professional are warranted.",Success
"A 45-year-old female presents to the emergency department with gross hematuria and acute, colicky flank pain. She denies any previous episodes of hematuria. She reports taking high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin over several weeks due to persistent upper back pain. The patient’s blood pressure and temperature are normal, but she is found to have proteinuria. Physical examination is negative for palpable flank masses. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis:",D,"The correct answer is D. Papillary necrosis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms of gross hematuria and acute, colicky flank pain are consistent with a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). However, the presence of proteinuria and the patient's history of taking high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin over several weeks suggest a different diagnosis.

Papillary necrosis is a condition in which the renal papillae (the innermost part of the kidney) become damaged and die due to ischemia or toxic injury. The patient's history of taking high doses of analgesics, particularly acetaminophen, increases the risk of papillary necrosis. The presence of proteinuria also supports this diagnosis, as papillary necrosis can cause damage to the glomeruli and lead to proteinuria.

The other options can be ruled out based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination:

A. Diffuse cortical necrosis is a rare condition that typically occurs in the setting of severe hypertension, sepsis, or obstetric complications. It is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination.

B. Chronic pyelonephritis is a chronic infection of the kidneys that typically presents with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, not acute flank pain and hematuria.

C. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disorder that typically presents with a family history, palpable flank masses, and bilateral kidney enlargement. The patient's physical examination is negative for palpable flank masses, making ADPKD less likely.

E. Acute nephrolithiasis is a possible diagnosis, but the presence of proteinuria and the patient's history of taking high doses of analgesics make papillary necrosis a more likely diagnosis.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and medical history, papillary necrosis is the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 40-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of increased bilateral pain in his knees. The pain developed over time and now limits his mobility. He states that the pain is worse at the end of the day, though he does have some early-morning stiffness lasting about 20 minutes. He used to have some success with over-the-counter NSAIDs; however, they no longer help. The patient also has been taking metformin for the past 2 years and is severely obese, with a BMI of 41 kg/m2. Additionally, he states that he has felt increasingly tired during the day, often dozes off during work, and no longer feels refreshed when he wakes up in the morning. Upon examination, there is no tenderness on palpation or erythema; however, some crepitus is felt. He has no other complaints but has a family history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on his mother’s side. Which of the following factors is the underlying cause of the patient’s pain, as well as the rest of his complaints?",C,"The correct answer is C. Excess weight.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as bilateral knee pain, worse at the end of the day, and early-morning stiffness, are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA). The presence of crepitus on examination further supports this diagnosis. OA is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in joints, leading to bone-on-bone contact and pain.

The patient's severe obesity (BMI of 41 kg/m2) is a significant contributing factor to his knee pain. Excess weight puts additional stress on the joints, particularly weight-bearing joints like the knees, leading to accelerated cartilage wear and tear.

The patient's fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and lack of refreshment upon waking are likely related to sleep apnea, which is a common comorbidity with obesity. Sleep apnea can cause chronic fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and other symptoms.

There is no evidence to suggest an autoimmune disease (Option A) such as rheumatoid arthritis, as the patient does not have tenderness on palpation or erythema, and his symptoms are not consistent with an inflammatory arthritis.

Medication side effect (Option B) is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are not related to his metformin use.

Infection (Option D) is not supported by the patient's symptoms or examination findings.

Occult malignancy (Option E) is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a malignancy, and there is no evidence of systemic symptoms or signs of cancer.

In summary, the patient's excess weight is the underlying cause of his knee pain, as well as his fatigue and sleep-related symptoms.",Success
"A 40-year-old man comes to the physician because of shortness of breath, double vision, and fatigue for the past 4 weeks. He has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications. Physical examination shows drooping of the eyelids bilaterally. He is unable to hold his arms up for longer than 3 minutes. A CT scan of the chest shows an anterior mediastinal mass with smooth contours. A photomicrograph of a specimen from the mass is shown. Which of the following immunologic processes normally occurs in the region indicated by the arrow?",E,"The correct answer is E. Negative selection.

The photomicrograph shows a thymoma, a type of tumor that arises from the thymus gland. The arrow is pointing to the cortex of the thymus, where negative selection of T-cells occurs.

Negative selection is a crucial process in the development of T-cells, where immature T-cells that recognize self-antigens are eliminated to prevent autoimmune reactions. This process occurs in the thymic cortex, where immature T-cells interact with thymic epithelial cells and undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death) if they recognize self-antigens.

The other options are not correct because:

A. B-cell maturation occurs in the bone marrow, not in the thymus.

B. Macrophage activation is an immune response that occurs in response to infection or inflammation, and is not a normal process in the thymus.

C. V(D)J recombination is a process that occurs in the development of B-cells and T-cells, where genetic segments are rearranged to create a diverse repertoire of antigen receptors. While this process occurs in the thymus, it is not specific to the region indicated by the arrow.

D. Thymocyte formation is a broader process that encompasses the development of T-cells in the thymus, but it is not specific to the region indicated by the arrow.

The patient's symptoms, including shortness of breath, double vision, and fatigue, are consistent with a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that is often associated with thymoma. The CT scan finding of an anterior mediastinal mass with smooth contours is also consistent with a thymoma.",Success
"A 24-year-old man is brought in to the emergency department by his parents who found him in his room barely responsive and with slurring speech. The patients’ parents say that a bottle of oxycodone was found at his bedside and was missing 15 pills. On physical examination, the patient appears drowsy and lethargic and is minimally responsive to stimuli. His respiratory rate is 8/min and shallow, blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, and pulse is 60/min. On physical examination, miosis is present, and the pupils appear pinpoint. The patient is given a drug to improve his symptoms. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely administered?",A,"The correct answer is A. μ, κ, and δ receptor antagonist.

The patient's symptoms, such as drowsiness, lethargy, shallow breathing, and pinpoint pupils, are consistent with opioid overdose. The treatment of choice for opioid overdose is naloxone, a μ, κ, and δ receptor antagonist. Naloxone works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, displacing the opioid molecules, and reversing the respiratory depression and other symptoms associated with opioid overdose.

Naloxone is a competitive antagonist, meaning it binds to the same receptors as opioids but does not activate them. This allows it to reverse the effects of opioids and restore normal respiratory function.

The other options are not correct:

B. μ receptor agonist would worsen the symptoms of opioid overdose, not improve them.

C. к receptor agonist and μ receptor antagonist is not a accurate description of naloxone's mechanism of action.

D. μ, к, and ẟ receptor agonist would also worsen the symptoms of opioid overdose.

E. μ receptor partial agonist and к receptor agonist is a description of the mechanism of action of buprenorphine, a medication used to treat opioid use disorder, but not naloxone.

It's worth noting that naloxone is a lifesaving medication that should be administered promptly in cases of suspected opioid overdose.",Success
"A 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing shortness of breath and a non-productive cough for 2 months. She has been unable to perform her daily activities. She has had malaise and bilateral ankle pain during this period. She noticed her symptoms after returning from a vacation to Arizona. She is a research assistant at the university geology laboratory. She is originally from Nigeria and visits her family there twice a year; her last trip was 3 months ago. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 112/72 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is no palpable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Her left eye is notable for ciliary injection and photophobia. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count is within the reference range. An x-ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is E. Histoplasmosis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath, non-productive cough, and malaise, are consistent with a respiratory illness. The presence of bilateral ankle pain and ciliary injection (inflammation of the ciliary body in the eye) suggests a systemic inflammatory response.

The chest x-ray shows bilateral hilar adenopathy (enlargement of lymph nodes in the hilar region) and reticulonodular infiltrates, which are characteristic of histoplasmosis.

Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, which is commonly found in soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings. The patient's occupation as a research assistant in a geology laboratory and her recent trip to Arizona, where the fungus is endemic, increase the likelihood of exposure.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

A. Sarcoidosis: While sarcoidosis can cause bilateral hilar adenopathy, it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and the presence of ciliary injection.

B. Pulmonary tuberculosis: The patient's symptoms and chest x-ray findings are not consistent with tuberculosis, and the lack of fever and lymphadenopathy make this diagnosis less likely.

C. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: This diagnosis is unlikely given the presence of bilateral hilar adenopathy, which is not typically seen in hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

D. Hodgkin's lymphoma: The patient's symptoms and chest x-ray findings are not consistent with lymphoma, and the lack of palpable lymphadenopathy makes this diagnosis less likely.

It's worth noting that the patient's travel history to Nigeria is not directly related to the diagnosis, as histoplasmosis is not commonly found in Nigeria.",Success
"A 75-year-old man presents to his physician with a 1-year history of dysphagia for solids. His more recent complaints include dysphagia for liquids as well. The patient states that he has no difficulty initiating swallowing but occasionally food is stuck in his throat. He does not complain of pain while swallowing but has noticed minor unintentional weight loss. The patient has no history of speech-related pain or nasal regurgitation. His family history is unremarkable. During the examination, the patient appears ill, malnourished, and slightly pale. He is not jaundiced nor cyanotic. Physical examination is unremarkable. A swallowing study reveals a small outpouching in the posterior neck (see image). Which nerve is most likely involved in this patient’s symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is C. CN IX.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the dysphagia for solids and liquids, and the presence of a small outpouching in the posterior neck on the swallowing study, suggest a diagnosis of Zenker's diverticulum. Zenker's diverticulum is a pouch-like protrusion of the mucosa through the Killian's triangle, which is a weak area in the posterior pharyngeal wall.

The nerve most likely involved in this patient's symptoms is the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). The glossopharyngeal nerve is responsible for innervating the pharyngeal muscles, which are involved in swallowing. Damage or compression of the glossopharyngeal nerve can lead to dysphagia, particularly for solids and liquids.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms:

A. CN X (vagus nerve) is involved in swallowing, but it is not the primary nerve responsible for the symptoms described.

B. CN VII (facial nerve) is involved in facial expressions and taste, but it is not related to swallowing.

D. CN V (trigeminal nerve) is involved in facial sensation and motor functions, but it is not directly related to swallowing.

E. CN XII (hypoglossal nerve) is involved in tongue movements, but it is not primarily responsible for the symptoms described.

It's worth noting that the patient's symptoms and the presence of a Zenker's diverticulum are consistent with a diagnosis of pharyngeal dysphagia, which is a common condition in older adults.",Success

On examination, the thyroid is stony hard, tender and asymmetrically enlarged. There is also pain associated with swallowing. Laboratory studies show a serum T4 level of 4.4 μg/dL and a TSH level of 6.3 mU/L. A radionuclide thyroid scanning indicates that the nodule has low radioactive iodine uptake. Which of the following is the most likely pathology to be found in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Reidel thyroiditis.

Here's why:

The patient presents with a stony hard, tender, and asymmetrically enlarged thyroid gland, which is consistent with Reidel thyroiditis. The thyroid gland is typically firm and irregular in this condition. The patient also experiences pain associated with swallowing, which is a common symptom of Reidel thyroiditis.

The laboratory results show a serum T4 level of 4.4 μg/dL and a TSH level of 6.3 mU/L, indicating hypothyroidism. The radionuclide thyroid scanning shows low radioactive iodine uptake, which is consistent with Reidel thyroiditis.

Reidel thyroiditis is a rare inflammatory condition of the thyroid gland characterized by a hard, woody, and fibrotic thyroid gland. It often presents with hypothyroidism, and the thyroid gland is typically tender and painful.

The other options can be ruled out based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Anaplastic carcinoma is a type of thyroid cancer, but it is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

B. Medullary carcinoma is a type of thyroid cancer that arises from the parafollicular cells, but it is not typically associated with hypothyroidism and a hard, tender thyroid gland.

C. Granulomatous thyroiditis is an inflammatory condition of the thyroid gland, but it is typically associated with a tender and enlarged thyroid gland, and the laboratory results would likely show hyperthyroidism rather than hypothyroidism.

E. Silent thyroiditis is a type of thyroiditis that is typically painless and associated with hyperthyroidism, rather than hypothyroidism.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely pathology is Reidel thyroiditis.",Success
"A researcher is testing an unknown compound, X, and seeing the effect it has on renal function. When she applies compound X to the cells, she finds that the urinary concentration of sodium and the pH decreases while the urinary potassium increases. Which of the following correctly states:
1) the cells of the kidney this compound acts on and
2) the identity of compound X?",D,"The correct answer is D. Principal cells; aldosterone.

Here's why:

* The effects of compound X on renal function are:
	+ Decreased urinary sodium concentration: This suggests that the compound is increasing sodium reabsorption in the kidney.
	+ Decreased urinary pH: This implies that the compound is increasing hydrogen ion secretion, which is typically accompanied by increased potassium secretion.
	+ Increased urinary potassium: This is consistent with the increased hydrogen ion secretion mentioned above.
* Based on these effects, we can conclude that compound X is likely aldosterone, a hormone that regulates electrolyte balance and blood pressure.
* Aldosterone acts on principal cells in the collecting duct of the nephron, increasing sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion.

The other options can be eliminated because:

* Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) would increase sodium excretion, not decrease it, and would not have the same effects on potassium and pH.
* Furosemide is a loop diuretic that would increase sodium excretion, not decrease it, and would not have the same effects on potassium and pH.
* Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that would increase sodium excretion, not decrease it, and would not have the same effects on potassium and pH.
* Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, which would have the opposite effects of aldosterone on renal function.

Physical examination is significant for vesicular lesions noted on the tongue, gingiva, and lips, with some vesicles having ruptured and ulcerated, as well as palpable cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism in this patient's presentation?",D,"The correct answer is D. HSV-1.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a primary herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, specifically HSV-1. The presence of painful vesicular lesions on the lips, tongue, and buccal mucosa, along with fever, muscle aches, and lymphadenopathy, are all characteristic of primary HSV-1 infection.

HSV-1 is the most common cause of oral herpes, and primary infections often occur in childhood. The virus typically affects the oral mucosa, causing painful blisters and ulcers. The patient's age, symptoms, and physical examination findings all point towards HSV-1 as the most likely causative organism.

The other options are less likely:

A. CMV (Cytomegalovirus) typically causes a more systemic infection, and oral lesions are not a common presentation.

B. EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) is more commonly associated with infectious mononucleosis, which typically presents with fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy, but not typically with oral vesicular lesions.

C. HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is not typically associated with oral vesicular lesions, and the patient's presentation is not consistent with an HIV infection.

E. HSV-2 is more commonly associated with genital herpes, and while it can cause oral lesions, it is less likely to cause primary infections in children.

The patient's wife arrives and demands that ""everything"" be done to keep him alive because she ""can't go on living without him."" The patient's adult son is on his way to the hospital. If the patient arrests, which of the following should occur?",B,"The correct answer is B. Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate.

Explanation:

In this scenario, the patient has a written advance directive that explicitly states their wish not to be resuscitated in the event of a cardiac arrest. This document is a legally binding expression of the patient's autonomy and decision-making capacity.

The wife's demands to resuscitate the patient, despite the patient's advance directive, do not override the patient's prior wishes. The patient's autonomy and right to self-determination take precedence over the wishes of their loved ones.

The adult son's arrival does not change the course of action, as the patient's advance directive is a clear expression of their wishes, and the son's opinion does not supersede the patient's autonomy.

Consulting a judge (Option D) or the hospital ethics committee (Option E) may be necessary in cases where there is ambiguity or conflict regarding the patient's wishes, but in this scenario, the patient's advance directive is clear and unambiguous.

Therefore, the healthcare team should respect the patient's prior wishes and not resuscitate them if they arrest, as per Option B.",Success
"A 63-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of retrosternal chest pain. He describes it as 7 out of 10 in intensity. He has coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications are aspirin, simvastatin, metformin, and enalapril. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 33 years. On arrival, his pulse is 136/min and irregular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is C. Intravenous amiodarone.

The patient's ECG is not provided, but based on the symptoms and physical examination, it is likely that the patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR), given the irregular pulse and tachycardia. The patient's history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and smoking also increase the likelihood of AFib.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC) guidelines recommend that patients with AFib and RVR who are hemodynamically unstable (as indicated by the patient's low blood pressure) should receive rate control medication, such as amiodarone, to slow the ventricular rate and improve cardiac output.

Intravenous esmolol (Option B) is also a rate control medication, but it is not the best choice in this scenario because it can cause hypotension, which could worsen the patient's already low blood pressure.

Synchronized cardioversion (Option D) is not indicated in this scenario because the patient is not in a life-threatening arrhythmia, such as ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. Defibrillation (Option E) is also not indicated for the same reason.

Coronary angiogram (Option A) is not the next step in management because the patient's symptoms are more consistent with AFib and RVR rather than an acute coronary syndrome.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to administer intravenous amiodarone to control the patient's heart rate and improve his hemodynamic stability.",Success
"A 14-year-old boy presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and is found on ultrasound to have a gallstone. Based on clinical suspicion, a CBC, a Coombs test, and a bilirubin panel are obtained to determine the etiology of the gallstone. These tests reveal a mild normocytic anemia with associated reticulocytosis as well as an increased RDW. In addition there is an indirect hyperbilirubinemia and the Coombs test results are negative. To confirm the diagnosis, an osmotic fragility test is performed which shows increased fragility in hypotonic solution. In this patient, what findings would most likely be anticipated if a blood smear were obtained?",D,"The correct answer is D. Spherocytes.

Here's why:

The patient's laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS), a genetic disorder affecting the red blood cell membrane. The findings that support this diagnosis are:

* Mild normocytic anemia with reticulocytosis, indicating a chronic hemolytic anemia
* Increased RDW, suggesting anisocytosis (variation in red blood cell size)
* Indirect hyperbilirubinemia, indicating increased bilirubin production due to hemolysis
* Negative Coombs test, ruling out autoimmune hemolytic anemia
* Increased osmotic fragility, which is a characteristic feature of HS

On a blood smear, spherocytes are typically seen in Hereditary Spherocytosis. Spherocytes are red blood cells that are smaller and more spherical in shape than normal, with a decreased surface-to-volume ratio. This abnormal shape makes them more susceptible to hemolysis.

The other options are not consistent with the diagnosis of Hereditary Spherocytosis:

* A. Hypersegmented neutrophils are seen in conditions like megaloblastic anemia, not HS.

A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of a tingling sensation in his right forearm. He reports that his symptoms started after he lifted heavy weights at the gym. Physical examination shows loss of sensation on the lateral side of the right forearm. Sensation over the thumb is intact. Range of motion of the neck is normal. His symptoms do not worsen with axial compression or distraction of the neck. Further examination of this patient is most likely to show weakness of which of the following actions?,B,"The correct answer is E. Wrist extension.

The patient's symptoms, including tingling sensation in the right forearm and loss of sensation on the lateral side of the right forearm, suggest a peripheral nerve injury. The fact that the symptoms started after lifting heavy weights at the gym and did not worsen with axial compression or distraction of the neck points towards a localized nerve injury rather than a cervical spine or radicular problem.

Given the patient's symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is compression or injury of the radial nerve, which is responsible for wrist extension. The radial nerve is commonly injured during heavy lifting or trauma to the arm, and can cause numbness or tingling sensations on the lateral side of the forearm.

The other options are not directly related to the radial nerve or the patient's symptoms:

A. Shoulder abduction is primarily controlled by the supraspinatus muscle, which is innervated by the suprascapular nerve.

B. Elbow flexion is primarily controlled by the biceps brachii muscle, which is innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve.

C. Forearm pronation is primarily controlled by the pronator teres muscle, which is innervated by the median nerve.

D. Index finger flexion is primarily controlled by the flexor digitorum profundus muscle, which is innervated by the anterior interosseous nerve (a branch of the median nerve).

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the likely diagnosis of radial nerve injury, the correct answer is E. Wrist extension.",Success
"A 30-year-old woman presents to your office with decreased appetite, malaise, and fever. Serologic tests reveal positive Anti-HBsAg and Anti-HAV IgM antibodies. Which of the following is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation?",C,"The correct answer is C. Shellfish.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation with decreased appetite, malaise, and fever, along with the serologic test results, suggests an acute hepatitis infection. The presence of Anti-HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) antibodies indicates that the patient has been exposed to the hepatitis B virus, but it's not the primary cause of her current symptoms.

The key finding is the presence of Anti-HAV IgM antibodies, which are indicative of an acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. Hepatitis A is primarily spread through the fecal-oral route, and consuming contaminated food or water is a common mode of transmission. Shellfish, in particular, can be a source of HAV infection if they are harvested from contaminated waters.

The other options are unlikely to be responsible for the patient's presentation:

A. Needlestick: While hepatitis B can be transmitted through needlestick injuries, the presence of Anti-HBsAg antibodies suggests that the patient has already developed immunity to hepatitis B, and it's not the cause of her current symptoms.

B. Unprotected sex: Hepatitis A is not typically spread through sexual contact.

D. Chronic hepatitis: The patient's symptoms and the presence of Anti-HAV IgM antibodies suggest an acute infection, rather than a chronic one.

E. Acetaminophen overdose: Acetaminophen overdose can cause liver damage, but it would not result in the presence of Anti-HAV IgM antibodies.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's presentation is consuming contaminated shellfish, which led to an acute hepatitis A infection.",Success
"A 63-year-old patient presents to the emergency department because of severe left leg pain and tingling. His condition started suddenly 30 minutes ago. He has had hypertension for the past 10 years for which he takes bisoprolol. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), the blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 100/min and irregular. On physical examination, the patient appears in severe pain and his left leg is pale and cool. The popliteal pulse is weaker on the left side compared to the right side. Which of the following is the most common cause of this patient's condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Arterial emboli.

The patient's symptoms, such as sudden onset of severe leg pain and tingling, pale and cool leg, and weaker popliteal pulse on the affected side, are consistent with acute limb ischemia. Given the patient's age, hypertension, and irregular pulse, the most likely cause is an arterial embolus.

Arterial emboli are a common cause of acute limb ischemia, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation, which is suggested by the patient's irregular pulse. Emboli can originate from the heart, atherosclerotic plaques, or other sources, and travel to the peripheral arteries, causing sudden occlusion and ischemia.

The other options are less likely causes of the patient's condition:

A. Vasculitis is a chronic inflammatory condition that typically presents with gradual onset of symptoms, not sudden onset like in this case.

B. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a genetic disorder that can increase the risk of thrombosis, but it is not a common cause of acute limb ischemia.

C. Arterial thrombosis is a possible cause of acute limb ischemia, but it typically occurs in patients with underlying atherosclerosis, and the symptoms may develop more gradually.

E. Arterial trauma is unlikely in this case, given the patient's age and lack of history of trauma.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the Society for Vascular Surgery, recommend prompt evaluation and treatment of acute limb ischemia, including imaging studies and potential surgical or endovascular interventions.",Success
"A 17-year-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her father for evaluation. He is concerned that she has not undergone puberty yet, while all of her classmates at school have. The patient herself feels well overall, with no specific complaints. Examination shows vital signs of T 98.9, HR 71, and BP 137/92. The physician notes undeveloped breasts and normal external and internal female genitalia in Tanner I stage of development. Her body mass index is within normal limits, she is in the 40th percentile for height, and she is agreeable and pleasant during the interview. Which of the following additional findings is likely present in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Hypokalemia.

The patient's presentation suggests a diagnosis of Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by a partial or complete absence of one of the X chromosomes in females. The symptoms include delayed or absent puberty, short stature, and normal female genitalia. The patient's vital signs, particularly the blood pressure of 137/92, are also consistent with Turner syndrome, as hypertension is a common feature of the condition.

Hypokalemia (low potassium levels) is a common finding in Turner syndrome due to the presence of hypertension and the effects of excess aldosterone, a hormone that regulates electrolyte balance.

The other options are not likely to be present in this patient:

A. Aromatase enzyme deficiency is a rare condition that affects the production of estrogen, leading to virilization in females. It is not consistent with the patient's presentation of delayed puberty.

C. Increased levels of sex hormones would be expected in a patient with precocious puberty, not delayed puberty.

D. XY karyotype would indicate a male genetic makeup, which is not consistent with the patient's normal female genitalia and undeveloped breasts.

E. Hypercortisolism (Cushing's syndrome) is a hormonal disorder characterized by excess cortisol production, leading to symptoms such as weight gain, moon facies, and hirsutism. It is not related to delayed puberty or the patient's other symptoms.

It's essential to note that a definitive diagnosis of Turner syndrome would require a karyotype analysis to confirm the presence of a 45,X or mosaic karyotype.",Success
"Current recommendations state that a single hemoglobin A1c value of greater than 6.5% is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. If this 6.5% cut-off is to be increased to 7.0%, which of the following would be true?",A,"The correct answer is A. Increase in false negative test results.

Here's why:

If the cut-off value for diagnosing diabetes mellitus is increased from 6.5% to 7.0%, it means that more individuals with hemoglobin A1c values between 6.5% and 7.0% would not be diagnosed with diabetes, even if they actually have the condition. This would lead to an increase in false negative test results.

False negative results occur when a test fails to detect a condition that is actually present. In this case, the increased cut-off value would result in some individuals with diabetes being misclassified as not having the condition.

The other options are not correct:

B. Increasing the cut-off value would actually decrease the number of false positive test results, as fewer individuals without diabetes would be misclassified as having the condition.

C. The number of true negative test results would increase, as more individuals without diabetes would be correctly classified as not having the condition.

D. The number of true positive test results would decrease, as some individuals with diabetes would be misclassified as not having the condition.

E. The specificity of the test would actually increase, as the test would be more accurate in identifying individuals without diabetes.

It's essential to note that changing the diagnostic cut-off value can have significant implications for patient care and public health. Any changes to diagnostic criteria should be based on rigorous scientific evidence and careful consideration of the potential consequences.",Success
"Patients with the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia make a specific type of hemoglobin known as HgbS. This mutation results in the sickling of their red blood cells when exposed to inciting factors such as hypoxic conditions. Patients are often treated with hydroxyurea, which has which of the following direct effects on their hemoglobin physiology?",C,"The correct answer is C. Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF).

Hydroxyurea is a medication commonly used to treat sickle cell anemia. Its primary mechanism of action is to increase the production of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF), which is a type of hemoglobin present in fetuses and infants. HgbF has a higher affinity for oxygen than adult hemoglobin, which helps to reduce the sickling of red blood cells.

By increasing HgbF levels, hydroxyurea helps to:

* Reduce the concentration of HgbS, the abnormal hemoglobin responsible for sickling
* Decrease the frequency and severity of sickling crises
* Improve red blood cell survival and reduce anemia
* Lower the risk of complications associated with sickle cell anemia, such as stroke and pulmonary hypertension

The other options are incorrect:

A. Hydroxyurea does not directly increase the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin.

B. Hydroxyurea does not decrease the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin.

D. While hydroxyurea may indirectly reduce HgbS levels by increasing HgbF, it does not have a direct effect on HgbS levels.

E. Hydroxyurea increases HgbF levels, not decreases them.

It's essential to note that hydroxyurea's effects on HgbF levels are specific to its mechanism of action in sickle cell anemia and do not apply to other conditions or hemoglobinopathies.",Success
"A 40-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. He has a history of cirrhosis of the liver secondary to alcoholism. He started becoming more confused a few days ago and it has been getting gradually worse. His temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 134/90 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals a distended abdomen that is non-tender. Neurological exam is notable for a confused patient and asterixis. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 3.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 22 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 59 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best next treatment for this patient?",D,"The correct answer is C. Lactulose.

The patient's presentation, including altered mental status, asterixis, and a history of cirrhosis, suggests hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Asterixis, a flapping tremor of the hands, is a characteristic sign of HE.

The laboratory values are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level, which is not the primary concern at this point.

The best next treatment for this patient is lactulose, a non-absorbable disaccharide that helps reduce the production and absorption of ammonia in the gut. Ammonia is a toxin that can contribute to HE in patients with cirrhosis. Lactulose works by acidifying the colon, which traps ammonia and prevents its absorption into the bloodstream.

Ceftriaxone (A) is an antibiotic that may be used to treat infections, but it is not specifically indicated for HE.

Dextrose (B) is not necessary, as the patient's glucose level is within normal range.

Potassium (D) supplementation may be necessary, but it is not the primary treatment for HE.

Rifaximin (E) is an antibiotic that can be used to treat HE, but it is typically used in combination with lactulose, and lactulose is the first-line treatment.

According to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines, lactulose is the recommended treatment for HE, and it should be administered orally or via nasogastric tube to achieve 2-3 soft stools per day.",Success
A previously healthy 4-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents because she has not stopped crying for the past 5 hours. Her parents report that she has not eaten anything during this period and that they were unable to calm her down. She has not had any trauma. She was born at term via vaginal delivery and her delivery was uncomplicated. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a reddened and swollen 2nd toe of the left foot. A photograph of the left foot is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,D,"The correct answer is D. Hair tourniquet syndrome.

The photograph of the left foot shows a reddened and swollen 2nd toe, which is consistent with hair tourniquet syndrome. This condition occurs when a strand of hair wraps around a toe, causing constriction and leading to pain, swelling, and erythema. It is a common cause of unexplained crying in infants and young children.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following reasons:

A. Raynaud phenomenon is a condition that affects blood flow to the fingers and toes, causing them to turn white or blue in response to cold or stress. It is unlikely to cause a localized lesion on a single toe.

B. Ingrown toenail is a condition that typically affects older children and adults, and it would not cause a sudden onset of crying in a 4-month-old infant.

C. Insect bite is possible, but it would not typically cause a localized lesion on a single toe, and it would not explain the sudden onset of crying.

E. Herpetic whitlow is a viral infection that causes painful lesions on the fingers and toes, but it is rare in infants and would not typically cause a sudden onset of crying.

Hair tourniquet syndrome is a common and often overlooked diagnosis in pediatric emergency medicine. It is essential to examine the toes carefully to look for any signs of hair wrapping around the toe, and to remove the hair strand to relieve the constriction and alleviate the symptoms.",Success
A 35-year-old woman presents to the physician because of episodes of difficulty swallowing for the past 3 months. She feels solid food getting stuck in her chest behind the sternum. She does not have any issues with liquids. She has no coughing or nasal regurgitation. She has no hoarseness or weight loss. She reports occasional heartburn that has lasted for about a year. Her past medical history is significant for asthma and eczema. She has no history of any serious illness and takes no medications. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormal findings. An endoscopic image of the esophagus is shown. Mucosal biopsy shows eosinophilic infiltration. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time?,E,"The correct answer is B. Budesonide.

The patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing solid food, feeling of food getting stuck in the chest, and occasional heartburn are consistent with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). The endoscopic image and mucosal biopsy showing eosinophilic infiltration further support this diagnosis.

Budesonide is a topical corticosteroid that is commonly used to treat EoE. It has been shown to reduce eosinophilic inflammation and improve symptoms in patients with EoE. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines recommend topical corticosteroids, such as budesonide, as first-line therapy for EoE.

Amlodipine (Option A) is a calcium channel blocker used to treat hypertension, and it is not indicated for EoE.

Fluconazole (Option C) is an antifungal medication, and it is not relevant to the diagnosis of EoE.

Nitroglycerin (Option D) is a vasodilator used to treat angina pectoris, and it is not indicated for EoE.

Omeprazole (Option E) is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). While the patient does report occasional heartburn, the symptoms and biopsy results are more consistent with EoE than GERD. PPIs are not effective in treating EoE, and they may even mask the symptoms, leading to delayed diagnosis.

Therefore, budesonide is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time.",Success
"A 2-year-old boy in respiratory distress is brought to the emergency department by his parents. They state that approximately one hour after putting their child to sleep, a ""hacking"" cough was heard from his bedroom. After entering his room the parents state their child appeared to be in distress, making a high pitched noise with every breath. Beyond a runny nose for the past few days, the child has been healthy. He has no toys in his bed or access to any other small objects. Physical exam demonstrates a 2-year-old child in respiratory distress.

Which of the following choices is the proper management for this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Dexamethasone, racemic epinephrine, and observation for 4 hours; discharge if stridor remits.

The patient's symptoms, including the high-pitched noise with every breath (stridor) and respiratory distress, are consistent with croup, a common viral infection in young children. The presence of a runny nose for the past few days supports this diagnosis.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends the following management for croup:

* Dexamethasone is the first-line treatment for croup, as it reduces inflammation and swelling in the airway.
* Racemic epinephrine can be used as an adjunct therapy to further reduce airway swelling.
* Observation for at least 4 hours is necessary to monitor for signs of worsening respiratory distress or other complications.
* If the patient's stridor remits, they can be discharged home with close follow-up.

Option A is incorrect because, while humidified oxygen and dexamethasone are part of the management, discharge without further observation is not recommended.

Option B is incorrect because croup requires treatment and observation to ensure the patient's safety.

Option D is incorrect because there is no indication of a foreign body in the upper airway, and bronchoscopy is not a recommended treatment for croup.

Option E is incorrect because empiric IV antibiotics are not indicated for croup, and intubation is not necessary unless the patient's respiratory status deteriorates significantly.",Success
"A 70-year-old woman with no significant medical history begins to experience memory loss and personality changes. Over the next few months, her symptoms become more severe, as she experiences rapid mental deterioration. She also starts to have sudden, jerking movements in response to being startled and gait disturbances. Eventually, she lapses into a coma and dies eight months after the onset of symptoms. What process likely caused this woman's illness?",D,"The correct answer is D. Conversion of a protein from an a-helix to a ß-pleated form, which resists degradation.

The patient's symptoms, including rapid mental deterioration, sudden jerking movements (myoclonus), and gait disturbances, are consistent with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. CJD is caused by the misfolding of a normal cellular protein called the prion protein, which leads to the formation of abnormal, insoluble fibrils that accumulate in the brain and cause tissue damage.

The conversion of the prion protein from an alpha-helix to a beta-pleated sheet structure is the key event in the pathogenesis of CJD. This conformational change makes the protein resistant to degradation and allows it to accumulate in the brain, leading to neuronal death and tissue damage.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta is characteristic of Parkinson's disease, which presents with motor symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia, rather than the rapid mental deterioration and myoclonus seen in this patient.

B. Autoimmune inflammation and demyelination of the central nervous system are characteristic of multiple sclerosis, which typically presents with relapsing and remitting episodes of neurological symptoms, rather than the rapid progression seen in this patient.

C. Autoimmune inflammation and demyelination of the peripheral nervous system are characteristic of conditions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, which presents with acute weakness and numbness, rather than the cognitive and motor symptoms seen in this patient.

E. Frontotemporal atrophy and the accumulation of intracellular, aggregated tau protein are characteristic of frontotemporal dementia, which presents with gradual cognitive decline and behavioral changes, rather than the rapid mental deterioration and myoclonus seen in this patient.",Success

Biopsy of the lower lip shows marked lymphocytic infiltration of the minor salivary glands. Which of the following is most likely seen in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Anti-Sjögren's syndrome type B (SS-B) antibody.

The patient's symptoms of eye dryness and foreign body sensation, along with the physical examination findings of mucosal ulceration and atrophy in the oral cavity, are consistent with Sjögren's syndrome. The biopsy result showing marked lymphocytic infiltration of the minor salivary glands further supports this diagnosis.

Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and damage to the exocrine glands, particularly the salivary and lacrimal glands. The presence of anti-SS-B antibodies is a common serological feature of Sjögren's syndrome, and they are often used as a diagnostic marker for the condition.

The other options are not directly related to Sjögren's syndrome:

* Anti-centromere antibody (B) is associated with limited systemic sclerosis (CREST syndrome).
* Anti-Jo-1 antibody (C) is associated with polymyositis and dermatomyositis.
* Anti-Scl-70 antibodies (D) are associated with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).

Treatment with a drug that directly antagonizes the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways is begun. Which of the following drugs was most likely started?,D,"The correct answer is D. Tiotropium.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The treatment described, which directly antagonizes the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways, is an anticholinergic medication. Tiotropium is a long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator that works by blocking the action of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors in the airways, thereby reducing bronchospasm and improving lung function. It is commonly used to treat COPD.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Fluticasone is an inhaled corticosteroid, which is used to reduce inflammation in the airways, but it does not directly antagonize vagal stimulation.

B. Montelukast is a leukotriene modifier, which is used to treat asthma, but it does not have anticholinergic effects.

C. Albuterol is a short-acting beta2-agonist, which is used to relieve bronchospasm, but it does not directly antagonize vagal stimulation.

E. Cromolyn is a mast cell stabilizer, which is used to prevent asthma attacks, but it does not have anticholinergic effects.

Two days ago, his mother found that he had left the gas on in the kitchen, and he was unable to smell the odor of the gas. As a child, he was consistently in the 40th percentile for height; now he is in the 15th percentile. He had bilateral orchidopexy for cryptorchidism as an infant. The patient is unable to identify several common odors when presented with them. Physical examination shows sparse axillary and pubic hair and Tanner stage 1 genitals. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Impaired migration of GnRH neurons.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) and anosmia (loss of sense of smell).

The key features of Kallmann syndrome include:

1. Hypogonadism: The patient's sparse axillary and pubic hair, Tanner stage 1 genitals, and decreased growth velocity (from 40th to 15th percentile) suggest hypogonadism.
2. Anosmia: The patient's inability to smell the gas odor and identify common odors indicates a loss of sense of smell.
3. Cryptorchidism: The patient's history of bilateral orchidopexy for cryptorchidism as an infant is consistent with Kallmann syndrome.

Kallmann syndrome is caused by impaired migration of GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) neurons from the olfactory placode to the hypothalamus during fetal development. This leads to a deficiency of GnRH, resulting in HH and anosmia.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Compression of pituitary stalk: This could cause hypopituitarism, but it would not explain the patient's anosmia and cryptorchidism.

B. Hyperprolactinemia: This could cause hypogonadism, but it would not explain the patient's anosmia and cryptorchidism.

D. Sex chromosome trisomy: This would not explain the patient's anosmia and hypogonadism.

The physician is interested in going on a date with her. Which of the following is the most appropriate reaction for the physician to have to the patient's invitation?",A,"The correct answer is A. Inform the patient that romantic relationships with current patients are unethical.

The American Medical Association (AMA) Code of Medical Ethics states that romantic or sexual relationships between physicians and their current patients are unethical. This is because the power dynamic in the physician-patient relationship can create a situation where the patient may feel pressured or coerced into a romantic or sexual relationship, compromising their autonomy and potentially harming them.

In this scenario, the patient is still under the physician's care, and the physician has a professional obligation to maintain a therapeutic relationship with her. Accepting her invitation for a date would be a breach of professional boundaries and could compromise the patient's care.

The other options are not correct:

B. The complexity of the patient's case is not relevant to the ethical consideration of dating a current patient.

C. While it is true that dating a former patient may be acceptable in some circumstances, this option is too broad and does not address the specific situation.

D. Transferring care to another physician does not resolve the ethical issue, as the physician would still be engaging in a romantic relationship with a patient they have a professional relationship with.

The physician suspects that the patient is suffering from a chronic lung infection. Which of the following statements best describes the type of lung inflammation in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. It consists of a largely circumscribed granuloma with epithelioid cells with Langhans cells.

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the physician suspects a chronic lung infection, which is likely tuberculosis (TB). The description of the lung inflammation in option C is consistent with TB.

In TB, the granuloma is characterized by a central area of caseous necrosis surrounded by a rim of epithelioid cells, which are activated macrophages that have undergone a transformation to become more epithelial-like. Langhans cells are a type of epithelioid cell that have a characteristic ""horseshoe"" shape. The granuloma is typically well-circumscribed and may be surrounded by a layer of fibroblasts and collagen.

Option A is incorrect because it describes a granuloma with few epithelioid cells and fibrosis, which is not characteristic of TB.

Option B is incorrect because it describes a granuloma with Anitchov cells, which are not typically seen in TB. Anitchov cells are seen in rheumatoid arthritis.

Option D is incorrect because it describes an ill-defined granuloma, which is not characteristic of TB. TB granulomas are typically well-defined and circumscribed.

On physical examination, the temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the pulse is 120/min, the blood pressure is 114/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 32/min. Auscultation of the chest reveals bilateral wheezing. The physician asks the nurse to administer nebulized albuterol; however, the boy declines nebulized albuterol because of a history of palpitations that he experienced previously. The physician then prescribes nebulized ipratropium bromide, which results in significant clinical improvement. Which of the following second messenger systems is affected by the drug that improved the boy's symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Phosphoinositol system.

Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic medication that acts as a muscarinic receptor antagonist. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates the contraction of airway smooth muscle and increases mucus production. By blocking muscarinic receptors, ipratropium bromide reduces the contraction of airway smooth muscle, leading to bronchodilation and relief of symptoms in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The phosphoinositol system is a second messenger system that is involved in the signaling pathway of muscarinic receptors. When acetylcholine binds to muscarinic receptors, it activates the phospholipase C enzyme, which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 then releases calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to muscle contraction and other cellular responses. By blocking muscarinic receptors, ipratropium bromide interrupts this signaling pathway, reducing the contraction of airway smooth muscle and leading to bronchodilation.

The other options are not directly related to the mechanism of action of ipratropium bromide:

A. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) system: This second messenger system is involved in the signaling pathway of beta-adrenergic receptors, which are stimulated by medications like albuterol.

B. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) system: This second messenger system is involved in the signaling pathway of nitric oxide and other vasodilators.

"A 2050-g (4.5-lb) female newborn and a 2850-g (6.3-lb) female newborn are delivered at 37 weeks' gestation to a 23-year-old, gravida 2, para 1 woman. The mother had no prenatal care. Examination of the smaller newborn shows a flattened nose and left-sided clubfoot. The hematocrit is 42% for the smaller newborn and 71% for the larger newborn. This pregnancy was most likely which of the following?",A,"The correct answer is A. Monochorionic-diamniotic monozygotic.

Here's why:

* The twins have different birth weights, which suggests that they are not identical (monozygotic) twins with a shared placenta and amniotic sac (monochorionic-monoamniotic). If they were, they would likely have similar birth weights.
* The presence of a flattened nose and left-sided clubfoot in the smaller twin suggests that there may have been some compression or constraint in utero, which is consistent with a monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancy. In this type of pregnancy, the twins share a placenta but have separate amniotic sacs.
* The significant difference in hematocrit levels between the two twins (42% vs. 71%) suggests that there was some degree of unequal blood flow or transfusion between the twins, which is also consistent with a monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancy. This can occur due to the shared placenta and unequal distribution of blood flow.
* Options B and E are unlikely because the twins are monozygotic (identical), as evidenced by their similar gestational age and female sex. Dichorionic-diamniotic twins are typically dizygotic (fraternal) and would not have the same genetic makeup.
* Option D is not a common or recognized type of twin pregnancy.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) recognize monochorionic-diamniotic twin pregnancies as a type of monozygotic twin pregnancy, and the findings described in this scenario are consistent with this diagnosis.",Success
"A 55-year-old woman is found to have an abnormal mass on routine mammography. The mass is biopsied and cytology results are diagnostic for invasive ductal adenocarcinoma that is estrogen receptor positive. The patient is started on chemotherapy and ultimately has the mass resected. She is taking tamoxifen and has regular outpatient follow up appointments to monitor for any recurrence of cancer. The patient has a past medical history of asthma, obesity, and a uterine leimyoma which was definitively treated last year. Her last menstrual period was at the age of 47. The patient's vital signs and exam are unremarkable. Which of the following is a potential complication that could occur in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is B. Endometrial cancer.

Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), is commonly used as adjuvant therapy for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. While it has been shown to reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence, it also has a well-documented risk of increasing the incidence of endometrial cancer. This is because tamoxifen acts as an estrogen agonist in the uterus, stimulating the growth of endometrial tissue and potentially leading to hyperplasia or cancer.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's current medication or medical history:

A. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a potential complication of tamoxifen, but it is more commonly associated with its use in patients with a history of thromboembolic disease or those who are immobilized.

C. Eruption of seborrheic keratoses is a side effect of estrogen therapy, not tamoxifen.

D. Increased bleeding is not a typical complication of tamoxifen therapy.

E. Osteoporosis is a potential long-term complication of tamoxifen use, but it is more commonly associated with its use in premenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, tamoxifen may actually have a beneficial effect on bone density.

Given the patient's history of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and current use of tamoxifen, endometrial cancer is a potential complication that should be monitored for during her regular follow-up appointments.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman is brought to the physician because of agitation, confusion, and lethargy. She has also had progressive recurring headaches and visual impairment over the last month.

Creatinine 0.8 mg/L
Osmolality 300 mOsmol/kg H2O
Urine osmolality 240 mOsm/kg H2O
Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's hypernatremia?""",D,"The correct answer is D. Decreased antidiuretic hormone secretion.

Here's why:

The patient presents with hypernatremia (serum sodium level of 148 mEq/L), which is defined as a sodium level above 145 mEq/L. Hypernatremia can occur due to various reasons, including dehydration, diabetes insipidus, or excessive sodium intake.

In this case, the patient's laboratory results and clinical presentation suggest diabetes insipidus as the most likely explanation for her hypernatremia. The key findings that support this diagnosis are:

1. Hypernatremia (elevated serum sodium level)
2. Low urine osmolality (240 mOsm/kg H2O, which is lower than the normal range of 300-900 mOsm/kg H2O)
3. Normal serum osmolality (300 mOsmol/kg H2O, which indicates that the patient is not dehydrated)

Diabetes insipidus is a condition characterized by inadequate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion or resistance to ADH. ADH, also known as vasopressin, helps regulate water reabsorption in the kidneys. Without sufficient ADH, the kidneys are unable to concentrate urine, leading to polyuria (excessive urine production) and hypernatremia.

The other options are not supported by the patient's laboratory results and clinical presentation:

A. Increased water intake would lead to hyponatremia (low serum sodium level), not hypernatremia.

B. Increased antidiuretic hormone secretion would lead to water retention, hyponatremia, and concentrated urine, which is the opposite of the patient's presentation.

C. Increased adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion is not directly related to sodium regulation or diabetes insipidus.

E. Decreased adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion is also not directly related to sodium regulation or diabetes insipidus.

In summary, the patient's hypernatremia, low urine osmolality, and normal serum osmolality are consistent with diabetes insipidus due to decreased antidiuretic hormone secretion.",Success
"A 29-year-old woman presents to the physician with a blurred vision of her right eye for 2 days. She has pain around her right eye during eye movement. She takes no medications. At the clinic, her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 72/min, respirations are 15/min, and the temperature is 36.5℃ (97.7℉). On physical examination, illumination of the left eye results in bilateral pupillary constriction while illumination of the right eye results in a mild bilateral pupillary dilation. Fundoscopic examination shows optic disk swelling in the right eye. The color vision test shows decreased perception in the right eye. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Specific additional history should be obtained regarding which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is D. Sensory loss.

The patient's symptoms, including blurred vision, pain around the eye during eye movement, and optic disk swelling, are consistent with optic neuritis, an inflammatory condition that affects the optic nerve. The abnormal pupillary response and decreased color perception in the right eye further support this diagnosis.

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it is essential to obtain a specific additional history regarding sensory loss, as optic neuritis can be a symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease that affects the central nervous system. MS can cause sensory symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or weakness in the face, arms, or legs. Obtaining a history of sensory loss can help the physician assess the likelihood of MS as the underlying cause of the patient's optic neuritis.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and examination findings:

A. Dry eyes are not typically associated with optic neuritis or MS.

B. High-risk sexual behavior is not relevant to the patient's symptoms, and there is no indication of any sexually transmitted infections.

C. Oral ulcers can be a symptom of various conditions, but they are not specifically related to optic neuritis or MS.

"A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with complaints of cyclic vomiting for 3 days. The vomitus is watery and contains undigested food particles. She also complains of feeling tired and having the “sniffles”. She has not felt like eating or drinking since her symptoms started, and she has not taken any medications. Her concern now is that she immediately gets dizzy when she stands up. Vitals signs include: pulse 120/min, respiratory rate 9/min, and blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg. Her eyes are sunken, and her tongue appears dry. Which set of lab values would best correspond to this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is C. pH = 7.5, Pco2 = 34 mm Hg, HCO32- = 38 mEq/L.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, likely due to severe vomiting. The patient's complaints of dizziness upon standing, sunken eyes, and dry tongue are all indicative of dehydration.

The lab values provided are arterial blood gas (ABG) results, which help assess the patient's acid-base status. In this case, we're looking for a set of values that correspond to a patient with dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.

Option C is the correct answer because:

* pH = 7.5 indicates alkalosis (high pH), which is consistent with the patient's vomiting, as the stomach contents are acidic and the body is trying to compensate by retaining alkaline substances.
* Pco2 = 34 mm Hg is slightly low, indicating respiratory compensation for the metabolic alkalosis.
* HCO32- = 38 mEq/L is elevated, which is consistent with the body's attempt to compensate for the acid loss due to vomiting.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and physical examination:

* Option A has a high Pco2, which would indicate respiratory acidosis, not consistent with the patient's symptoms.
* Option B has a low pH, indicating acidosis, which is not consistent with the patient's vomiting and alkalotic symptoms.
* Option D has a high Pco2 and low HCO32-, indicating respiratory acidosis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.
* Option E has a normal pH, but the Pco2 and HCO32- values do not match the expected compensatory changes for a patient with vomiting and dehydration.

Therefore, option C is the best match for this patient's condition.",Success
"A 30-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of infertility. He and his wife have been trying to get pregnant for the past two years. They have used fertility monitors and other aids without success. A hysterosalpingogram in his wife was normal.

His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 120/85 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. On examination, he is a healthy-appearing male in no acute distress with fully developed reproductive organs. Notably, cardiac auscultation is silent in the left 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. This patient most likely has a mutation in which of the following classes of proteins?",D,"The correct answer is E. Anterograde cytoskeletal motor protein.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of Kartagener syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by the triad of:

1. Situs inversus (reversal of the normal position of the organs in the chest and abdomen)
2. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)
3. Chronic respiratory infections

The patient's history of recurrent upper respiratory infections, severe pneumonia, and cleft lip is consistent with this diagnosis. The silent area in the left 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line on cardiac auscultation suggests dextrocardia, which is a hallmark of situs inversus.

Kartagener syndrome is caused by mutations in the genes encoding dynein proteins, which are anterograde cytoskeletal motor proteins involved in ciliary function and left-right axis determination during embryonic development. Dynein proteins are responsible for the movement of cilia and flagella, and mutations in these genes lead to impaired ciliary function and the characteristic features of Kartagener syndrome.

The other options are not directly related to Kartagener syndrome or the patient's symptoms:

A. Microtubule monomeric protein: Microtubules are a type of cytoskeletal element, but mutations in microtubule monomeric proteins are not typically associated with Kartagener syndrome.

B. Lysosomal trafficking regulator protein: Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles involved in cellular digestion and recycling, and mutations in lysosomal trafficking regulator proteins are associated with lysosomal storage disorders, not Kartagener syndrome.

C. Transmembrane ion channel protein: Transmembrane ion channels are involved in various cellular processes, including nerve conduction and muscle contraction, but mutations in these proteins are not typically associated with Kartagener syndrome.

D. Retrograde cytoskeletal motor protein: Retrograde cytoskeletal motor proteins, such as dynein, are involved in the movement of vesicles and organelles along microtubules, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a defect in anterograde cytoskeletal motor proteins, such as dynein.",Success
"A 71-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension comes to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation. She has had multiple episodes of upper abdominal pain over the past year. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. Physical examination shows a distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness and high-pitched bowel sounds. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a dilated bowel, multiple air-fluid levels, and branching radiolucencies in the right infra-diaphragmatic region. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",B,"The correct answer is C. Obstruction of the common bile duct.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation, suggest a bowel obstruction. The physical examination findings of a distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness and high-pitched bowel sounds are consistent with this diagnosis. The abdominal x-ray findings of a dilated bowel, multiple air-fluid levels, and branching radiolucencies in the right infra-diaphragmatic region are also indicative of a bowel obstruction.

The branching radiolucencies in the right infra-diaphragmatic region are a classic radiographic sign of gallstones in the bile ducts, which suggests that the obstruction is related to a bile duct issue. Given the patient's history of upper abdominal pain over the past year, it is likely that she has gallstones that have migrated into the common bile duct, causing an obstruction.

Option A, perforation of the duodenal wall, is unlikely given the lack of free air on the abdominal x-ray and the absence of peritoneal signs on physical examination. Option B, inflammation of the gallbladder wall, may be present, but it is not the primary cause of the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings. Option D, occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery, would likely present with more severe symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, bloody stools, and signs of bowel ischemia, which are not described in this scenario. Option E, torsion of the large intestine, is unlikely given the lack of findings suggestive of a volvulus on the abdominal x-ray.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and radiographic evidence, the most likely cause of her condition is an obstruction of the common bile duct, likely due to a gallstone.",Success

Three days after the surgery, he develops fever and redness around the surgical site. His temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F). Physical examination shows purulent discharge from the wound with erythema of the surrounding skin. Wound culture of the purulent discharge shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Treatment with oral dicloxacillin is initiated. Four days later, the patient continues to have high-grade fever, pain, and purulent discharge. Which of the following characteristics of the infecting organism best explains the failure to improve with antibiotic therapy?",E,"The correct answer is C. Ability to cleave β-lactam rings.

The scenario describes a patient with a surgical site infection (SSI) caused by a gram-positive coccus in clusters, which is consistent with Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is treated with oral dicloxacillin, a β-lactam antibiotic, but fails to improve.

The reason for the failure to respond to antibiotic therapy is likely due to the production of β-lactamase, an enzyme that cleaves the β-lactam ring of the antibiotic, rendering it ineffective. This is a common mechanism of resistance in S. aureus.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Secretion of a pyrogenic toxin: While S. aureus can produce toxins, this would not explain the failure to respond to antibiotic therapy.

B. Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane: This characteristic is more typical of gram-negative bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which have a outer membrane that can impede the penetration of antibiotics.

D. Development of efflux pumps: This mechanism of resistance is more commonly seen in gram-negative bacteria and would not be the primary reason for the failure to respond to β-lactam antibiotics in this scenario.

E. Adaptation in binding proteins: This is a mechanism of resistance seen in some bacteria, but it is not the primary reason for the failure to respond to β-lactam antibiotics in this scenario.

In summary, the production of β-lactamase, which cleaves the β-lactam ring of the antibiotic, is the most likely explanation for the failure to respond to dicloxacillin therapy in this patient with a SSI caused by S. aureus.",Success

On exam, you notice a 2 cm nodule on her anterior neck. Her TSH level is normal and radionucleotide scan reveals a cold nodule. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) reveals follicular architecture suspicious for malignancy. What is the next best step?",B,"The correct answer is B. Surgical excision.

Here's why:

* The patient presents with a neck lump, and the FNAB reveals follicular architecture suspicious for malignancy, which suggests a possible thyroid cancer.
* The radionuclide scan showing a ""cold nodule"" means that the nodule is not taking up radioactive iodine, which is a common feature of thyroid cancer.
* Given the suspicious FNAB results and the cold nodule on the scan, the next best step is to perform surgical excision of the nodule to obtain a definitive diagnosis and potentially treat any underlying malignancy.

The other options are not the best choice for the following reasons:

* A. Punch biopsy is not typically used for thyroid nodules, and FNAB is already performed, which provides more information about the nodule's architecture.
* C. Thyroxine administration is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient's TSH level is normal, and there is no evidence of hypothyroidism.
* D. Ultrasound may be used to further evaluate the nodule, but it is not the next best step in this scenario, as the FNAB results are already suspicious for malignancy.
* E. CT scan is not typically used for the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules and may not provide additional information that would change the management plan.

A Swan-Ganz catheter is used to measure pressures in the right heart, including the right ventricle, right atrium, and pulmonary artery. The normal values for right ventricular pressures are:

* Systolic pressure: 15-30 mmHg
* Diastolic pressure: 0-8 mmHg

So, the correct answer is B. 25/5 mmHg, which falls within the normal range for right ventricular pressures.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. 25/10 mmHg: The diastolic pressure is slightly elevated.

C. 10/0 mmHg: The systolic pressure is lower than normal.

D. 100/5 mmHg: The systolic pressure is significantly elevated, indicating possible pulmonary hypertension.

E. 100/70 mmHg: The systolic and diastolic pressures are both significantly elevated, indicating possible pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure.

His speech is quiet and difficult to understand. Otoscopic examination shows retracted tympanic membranes bilaterally that are immobile on pneumatic otoscopy. Nasopharyngoscopy shows mild adenoid hypertrophy. Pure tone audiometry shows a conductive hearing loss of 26 dB on the right side and 28 dB on the left side. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Tympanostomy tube insertion.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a conductive hearing loss due to middle ear effusion or chronic otitis media with effusion (COME). The retracted and immobile tympanic membranes on otoscopy, along with the pure tone audiometry results, support this diagnosis. The history of recurrent ear infections and adenoid hypertrophy also contribute to the development of COME.

Tympanostomy tube insertion is the most appropriate next step in management because it can help to drain the middle ear effusion, improve ventilation, and restore hearing. This procedure is a common and effective treatment for COME in children.

The other options are not as appropriate:

A. Nasal decongestant therapy may help to reduce nasal congestion, but it will not address the underlying middle ear effusion.

B. Adenoidectomy may be considered in the future if the adenoid hypertrophy is contributing to the development of COME, but it is not the primary treatment for the patient's current symptoms.

D. Antihistamine therapy is not indicated for the treatment of COME.

E. Corticosteroid therapy may be used to reduce inflammation in some cases, but it is not a primary treatment for COME.

On physical examination, the patient’s consciousness is decreased with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13. He is pale and sweaty. His lung sounds are normal, cardiac sounds are decreased, and no murmurs are present. Abdominal palpation reveals epigastric tenderness. Neurological examination shows rapid downbeating nystagmus, facial muscle twitching, and symmetrically decreased sensation to all the sensory modalities on both the upper and lower extremities. Further discussion reveals that the patient was using sodium fluoroacetate as a pesticide, which is known to form fluorocitrate in the cells of aerobic organisms. Which of the following substances will accumulate in the patient’s cells?",B,"The correct answer is B. Citrate.

Sodium fluoroacetate, also known as Compound 1080, is a highly toxic pesticide that inhibits the enzyme aconitase in the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle). Aconitase converts citrate to isocitrate. When aconitase is inhibited, citrate accumulates in the cells.

Fluorocitrate, the toxic metabolite of sodium fluoroacetate, is a potent inhibitor of aconitase, leading to the accumulation of citrate in the cells. This inhibition disrupts the citric acid cycle, ultimately affecting energy production in the cells.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Fumarate is a metabolite that is formed downstream of aconitase in the citric acid cycle, so it would not accumulate due to aconitase inhibition.

C. Isocitrate is the product of the aconitase reaction, so its accumulation would not be expected when aconitase is inhibited.

D. Malate is another metabolite in the citric acid cycle, but it is not directly related to the inhibition of aconitase by fluorocitrate.

E. Succinate is also a metabolite in the citric acid cycle, but its accumulation is not directly related to the inhibition of aconitase by fluorocitrate.

Pulmonary examination shows diffuse crackles and rhonchi. An x-ray of the chest shows a left upper-lobe infiltrate of the lung. Two sets of blood cultures are obtained. Endotracheal aspirate Gram stain shows gram-negative rods. Two large bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluids are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",D,"The correct answer is D. Cefepime and levofloxacin.

Here's why:

The patient presents with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with a high fever, tachypnea, and hypotension, which indicates sepsis. The endotracheal aspirate Gram stain shows gram-negative rods, suggesting a potential cause of the pneumonia. Given the patient's history of COPD and recent chemotherapy, it's essential to cover for both typical and atypical pathogens.

Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin that provides excellent coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common pathogen in patients with COPD and cancer. It also covers other gram-negative rods, such as Klebsiella and E. coli.

Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that provides excellent coverage against atypical pathogens like Legionella and Mycoplasma, which can cause CAP. It also has activity against gram-negative rods, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The combination of cefepime and levofloxacin provides broad-spectrum coverage for both typical and atypical pathogens, making it the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient.

Here's why the other options are not the best choice:

A. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin: While ceftriaxone is a good choice for CAP, azithromycin may not provide adequate coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

B. Ertapenem: This carbapenem antibiotic has excellent coverage against gram-negative rods, but it may not provide adequate coverage against atypical pathogens.

C. Colistin: This antibiotic is typically reserved for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections and is not a first-line agent for CAP.

E. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate: This combination may not provide adequate coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and may not be effective against atypical pathogens.

He seems to respond to invisible stimuli, and he jumps from topic to topic without clear focus. Which of the following is most consistent with this patient's presentation?",C,"The correct answer is A. Bipolar with psychotic features.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation is characterized by:

1. Psychotic symptoms: He hears voices telling him to prepare for the end of the world, and he responds to invisible stimuli.
2. Mood disturbances: He experiences periods of erratic behavior, increased energy, and decreased need for sleep, which are consistent with manic episodes.
3. Cyclical pattern: His symptoms occur every other month, with periods of normal behavior in between, which is consistent with a bipolar disorder pattern.
4. Impaired functioning: His behavior has significantly impacted his academic performance, and he has spent huge amounts of money on online shopping during his manic episodes.

Given these features, the most likely diagnosis is bipolar disorder with psychotic features. The patient's symptoms do not meet the criteria for brief psychotic disorder, which is a short-lived episode of psychosis that lasts less than 1 month. Schizoaffective disorder is also unlikely, as the patient's mood disturbances are more prominent than his psychotic symptoms. Schizophreniform disorder is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's cyclical pattern of symptoms and the presence of clear manic episodes. Schizotypal personality disorder is not a good fit, as it is a personality disorder characterized by eccentric behavior and thinking, but it does not typically involve psychotic symptoms or mood disturbances.

"An 81-year-old man is brought to the clinic by his son to be evaluated for memory issues. The patient’s son says he has difficulty remembering recent events and names. He says the patient’s symptoms have progressively worsened over the last several years but became acutely worse just recently. Also, yesterday, the patient complained that he could not see out of his right eye, but today he can. When asked about these concerns, the patient seems to have no insight into the problem and reports feeling well. His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. He had a left basal ganglia hemorrhage 12 years ago and a right middle cerebral artery infarction 4 years ago. Current medications are amlodipine, aspirin, clopidogrel, metformin, sitagliptin, and valsartan. He lives with his son and can feed himself and change his clothes. There is no history of urinary or fecal incontinence. His vitals include: blood pressure 137/82 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented. He is unable to perform simple arithmetic calculations and the mini-mental status exam is inconclusive. He can write his name and comprehend written instructions. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side. The tone is also slightly reduced on the right side with exaggerated reflexes. His gait is hemiparetic. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Vascular dementia.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and medical history strongly suggest vascular dementia. The patient has a history of multiple cerebrovascular events, including a left basal ganglia hemorrhage 12 years ago and a right middle cerebral artery infarction 4 years ago. These events have likely contributed to his progressive cognitive decline.

The recent acute worsening of symptoms, including the transient episode of right eye blindness, suggests a new cerebrovascular event. The patient's physical examination findings, such as hemiparesis, reduced muscle tone, and exaggerated reflexes on the right side, are consistent with a vascular etiology.

Vascular dementia is a common cause of dementia in older adults, particularly those with a history of cerebrovascular disease. It is characterized by a stepwise decline in cognitive function, often with a sudden worsening of symptoms after a new cerebrovascular event.

While Alzheimer's disease (Option A) is a common cause of dementia, the patient's history of cerebrovascular events and stepwise decline in cognitive function make vascular dementia a more likely diagnosis. Frontotemporal dementia (Option B) is less likely given the patient's lack of prominent behavioral changes and language deficits. Lewy body dementia (Option C) is also less likely, as the patient does not exhibit prominent fluctuations in cognition, visual hallucinations, or parkinsonian symptoms. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (Option D) is unlikely given the patient's lack of urinary or fecal incontinence and normal vitals.

In summary, the patient's history of cerebrovascular events, stepwise decline in cognitive function, and physical examination findings make vascular dementia the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 46-year-old woman with a history of previously well-controlled HIV infection comes to the physician for follow-up after a health maintenance examination last week. She is currently unemployed and lives in a low-income neighborhood with her 3 children. For the past 3 years, her HIV RNA viral load was undetectable, but last week, her viral load was 8,391 copies/mL (N < 50). Current medications include dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine. On questioning, she says that she misses her medications every other day. Which of the following responses by the physician is most appropriate?",A,"The correct answer is A. """"""Let's talk about what makes it difficult for you to take your medications.""""""

The patient's recent viral load result indicates non-adherence to her antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen. The physician's response should focus on understanding the underlying reasons for her non-adherence rather than simply reiterating the importance of taking medications or providing a solution without addressing the root cause.

Option A is the most appropriate response because it acknowledges the patient's struggles with adherence and encourages her to share the challenges she faces in taking her medications regularly. This approach helps to build trust and allows the physician to identify potential barriers to adherence, such as lack of access to medications, side effects, or competing priorities. By understanding the patient's perspective, the physician can work with her to develop a personalized plan to improve adherence.

Option B is too didactic and may come across as lecturing, which could create a negative response from the patient. Option C is also not ideal, as it focuses on the negative consequences of non-adherence rather than addressing the underlying issues. Option D may be helpful in addressing potential financial barriers, but it does not directly address the patient's non-adherence. Option E assumes that the patient does not understand how to take her medications, which may not be the case, and does not address the underlying reasons for her non-adherence.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) both emphasize the importance of patient-centered care and addressing adherence barriers in HIV management. The CDC recommends that healthcare providers assess adherence at every visit and provide support to patients who are struggling with adherence.",Success
"A 67-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine medical check-up prior to a scheduled elective femoropopliteal bypass surgery of his left leg. He feels well but reports occasional episodes of weakness and numbness in his left hand. He has a history of peripheral arterial disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gout. The patient has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. He drinks 3 cans of beer daily. His current medications include aspirin, metformin, enalapril, simvastatin, and febuxostat. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 86/min, and blood pressure is 122/76 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Auscultation of the right side of the neck shows a bruit. There is a right-sided reducible inguinal hernia. Neurological examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, creatinine, and glucose are within the reference ranges. An electrocardiogram shows signs of mild left ventricular hypertrophy. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. Ultrasonography of the neck.

The patient's symptoms of occasional weakness and numbness in his left hand, combined with the presence of a bruit on the right side of the neck, suggest a possible diagnosis of carotid artery stenosis. A bruit is an abnormal sound heard over an artery, often indicating turbulent blood flow due to stenosis or occlusion.

Ultrasonography of the neck is a non-invasive and widely available imaging modality that can help diagnose carotid artery stenosis. It can provide information on the degree of stenosis, which is essential for determining the need for further evaluation and potential intervention.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps in management:

B. Echocardiography is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the bruit on the right side of the neck. While it may be useful in evaluating cardiac function, it is not the most relevant test in this scenario.

C. Warfarin therapy is not indicated at this point, as there is no evidence of atrial fibrillation or other conditions that would require anticoagulation.

D. CT angiography of the head may be useful in evaluating the cerebral vasculature, but it is a more invasive and higher-radiation test compared to ultrasonography. It would be more appropriate to perform CT angiography if the ultrasonography results suggest significant carotid artery stenosis.

E. Digital subtraction angiography of the neck is an invasive test that is typically reserved for patients who are being considered for carotid endarterectomy or stenting. It is not necessary at this point in the evaluation.

In summary, ultrasonography of the neck is the most appropriate next step in management to evaluate the patient's symptoms and the bruit on the right side of the neck, and to determine the presence and severity of carotid artery stenosis.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider concerned that she may be pregnant. She has a history of regular menstruation every 4 weeks that lasts about 4 days with mild to moderate bleeding, but she missed her last period 2 weeks ago. A home pregnancy test was positive. She has a 6-year history of hyperthyroidism that is well-controlled with daily methimazole. She is currently asymptomatic and has no complaints or concerns. A blood specimen is taken and confirms the diagnosis. Additionally, her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is 2.0 μU/mL. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Discontinue methimazole, start propylthiouracil.

Here's why:

The patient is pregnant, and her hyperthyroidism is well-controlled with methimazole. However, methimazole is not the preferred medication for hyperthyroidism during pregnancy. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the recommended medication for hyperthyroidism during the first trimester of pregnancy because it is less likely to cause fetal abnormalities compared to methimazole.

The American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines recommend that women with hyperthyroidism who become pregnant should be switched from methimazole to PTU as soon as possible, ideally before conception or during the first trimester. This is because methimazole has been associated with a higher risk of fetal aplasia cutis, a congenital skin defect.

In this case, the patient's TSH level is within the normal range, indicating that her hyperthyroidism is well-controlled. However, it's essential to switch her medication to PTU to minimize the risk of fetal complications.

The other options are not correct:

A. Continuing methimazole is not recommended during pregnancy due to the potential risks to the fetus.

C. Glucocorticoids are not indicated for the management of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy.

D. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that may be used to control symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tremors or anxiety, but it's not a substitute for antithyroid medications like methimazole or PTU.

E. Radioiodine therapy is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding, as it can cause fetal thyroid damage and increase the risk of thyroid cancer in the mother.

Therefore, the next best step in the management of this patient is to discontinue methimazole and start propylthiouracil.",Success
"A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with back pain. The patient states that he has gradually worsening back pain that seems to have worsened after moving furniture the other day. He also states that while he walks, he feels numbness and weakness in his legs. The only time the patient states his back pain is improved is when he is riding his bike or pushing a cart at the grocery store. The patient has a past medical history of osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. He drinks 3 alcoholic drinks every day and has a 44 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 157/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a non-tender spine with normal mobility in all 4 directions. Radiography of the spine and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Spinal stenosis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, particularly the worsening back pain with numbness and weakness in the legs while walking, are consistent with spinal stenosis. The fact that his back pain improves when he is riding his bike or pushing a cart at the grocery store suggests that his symptoms are relieved when he is in a flexed position, which is a classic feature of spinal stenosis.

Spinal stenosis is a condition where the spinal canal narrows, putting pressure on the spinal cord and nerves. This can cause back pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the legs, especially with walking or standing. The patient's age, history of osteoporosis, and smoking history also increase his risk for spinal stenosis.

Option A, compression fracture, is unlikely given the patient's non-tender spine on physical exam. Option B, herniated nucleus pulposus, may cause back pain and leg symptoms, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the fact that his symptoms are relieved with flexion. Option C, musculoskeletal strain, is a possible diagnosis, but it does not fully explain the patient's leg symptoms and the pattern of relief with flexion. Option E, vascular claudication, is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and the fact that his oxygen saturation is normal on room air.

Radiography of the spine and basic labs will likely show evidence of spinal stenosis, such as narrowing of the spinal canal, and may rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms.",Success

Bowel sounds are increased. Stool microscopy shows pear-shaped multi-flagellated organisms. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following?",B,"The correct answer is D. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass deficiency, which is a primary immunodeficiency disorder. The recurrent episodes of sinusitis, otitis media, and gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea and abdominal cramps, are consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of Giardia lamblia (pear-shaped multi-flagellated organisms) in the stool further supports this diagnosis, as individuals with IgG subclass deficiency are more susceptible to gastrointestinal infections.

Individuals with IgG subclass deficiency are at increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), which is a type of cancer that affects the immune system. This is because their impaired immune system makes them more susceptible to malignant transformations.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and diagnosis:

A. Progressive peripheral neuropathy is not typically associated with IgG subclass deficiency.

B. Anaphylactic transfusion reactions are not related to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.

C. Cutaneous granulomas are not typically seen in IgG subclass deficiency.

E. Disseminated tuberculosis is not suggested by the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings.

Cardiac exam is significant for a holosystolic murmur heard best over the apex of the heart. Which of the following histopathologic findings is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Granulomas with giant cells.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is rheumatic fever, a complication of untreated group A streptococcal pharyngitis. The patient's recent sore throat, pale and ill-looking appearance, and presence of pink rings on the torso and inner surfaces of the limbs (erythema marginatum) are all consistent with this diagnosis. The holosystolic murmur heard over the apex of the heart suggests cardiac involvement, which is a common complication of rheumatic fever.

Granulomas with giant cells are a characteristic histopathologic finding in rheumatic fever, particularly in the heart tissue. These granulomas, known as Aschoff bodies, are composed of inflammatory cells, including giant cells, and are a hallmark of the disease.

The other options are not directly related to rheumatic fever:

A. Atypical lymphocytes on peripheral blood smear are more commonly associated with infectious mononucleosis.

B. Starry sky appearance is a histopathologic finding characteristic of Burkitt lymphoma.

C. Needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystal deposits are typically seen in gout.

E. Caseating granulomas and giant cells are more commonly associated with tuberculosis.

Hemoglobin A1C is 6.3%, and creatinine is 1.3 g/dL. The remainder of his physical exam is unremarkable. If this patient's cough is due to one of the medications he is taking, what would be the next step in management?",E,"The correct answer is C. Change lisinopril to amlodipine.

The patient's dry cough is likely due to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, lisinopril. ACE inhibitors are known to cause cough in up to 20% of patients, and it is a common side effect of these medications. The cough is thought to be due to the increased levels of bradykinin, a potent cough stimulant, which is not broken down by ACE.

The next step in management would be to switch the patient to an alternative antihypertensive medication that is less likely to cause cough. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is a suitable option. It is an effective antihypertensive medication that is not associated with cough as a side effect.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Changing citalopram to escitalopram would not address the cough, as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are not typically associated with cough.

B. Changing lisinopril to propranolol would not be a good option, as propranolol is a beta blocker that can exacerbate asthma, which the patient already has.

D. Changing atorvastatin to lovastatin would not address the cough, as statins are not typically associated with cough.

E. Changing lisinopril to losartan would not be a good option, as losartan is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), which, although less likely to cause cough than ACE inhibitors, can still cause cough in some patients.",Success

The mother did not receive prenatal care. The infant's temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 170/min, and blood pressure is 71/39 mm Hg. Examination shows hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. These symptoms are mostly like due to maternal use of which of the following?",B,"The correct answer is D. Monoamine reuptake antagonist.

The symptoms described in the newborn, such as high-pitched crying, poor feeding, rhinorrhea, low-grade fever, hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response, are consistent with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS is a withdrawal syndrome that occurs in newborns exposed to certain medications or substances in utero, particularly opioids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and other antidepressants.

The mother's lack of prenatal care and the presence of these symptoms in the newborn suggest that the mother may have used antidepressant medications, specifically SSRIs, during pregnancy. SSRIs are monoamine reuptake antagonists, which increase the levels of serotonin and other neurotransmitters in the brain. Fetal exposure to these medications can lead to NAS in the newborn.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. GABAA receptor agonists, such as benzodiazepines, can cause withdrawal symptoms in newborns, but the symptoms described are more consistent with NAS.

B. Mu receptor agonists, such as opioids, can also cause NAS, but the mother's lack of prenatal care and the presence of hyperreflexia and tremors suggest SSRI exposure.

C. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, such as nicotine, can cause withdrawal symptoms in newborns, but the symptoms described are more consistent with NAS.

E. Thyroperoxidase inhibitors, such as methimazole, are used to treat maternal hyperthyroidism and are not typically associated with NAS.

A photograph of the peripheral blood smear is shown. Blood and urine cultures are negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?""",C,"The correct answer is B. Dengue hemorrhagic fever.

Justification:

The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results are consistent with dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Here's why:

1. Travel history: The patient recently returned from Sri Lanka, which is an endemic area for dengue fever.
2. Fever, headache, and abdominal discomfort: These symptoms are common in DHF.
3. Bleeding manifestations: The patient's gums bleed while brushing her teeth, and there are petechiae on her trunk and back, indicating a bleeding disorder.
4. Laboratory results:
	* Low platelet count (18,000/mm3) and hemoglobin (8.2 g/dL) suggest thrombocytopenia and anemia.
	* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (900 U/L) indicates hemolysis.
	* Mild elevation of bilirubin (3.0 mg/dL) and AST/ALT (20 U/L and 16 U/L, respectively) suggests liver involvement.
	* Normal INR and fibrin split products rule out disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
5. Peripheral blood smear: The photograph is not provided, but it likely shows thrombocytopenia and possibly fragmented red blood cells, which are characteristic of DHF.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

A. HELLP syndrome: Typically occurs in pregnant women, but the patient's laboratory results do not show significant liver enzyme elevations or coagulopathy.

C. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): Would typically present with more severe neurological symptoms, and the patient's laboratory results do not show evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.

D. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS): Would typically present with more severe renal impairment, and the patient's laboratory results do not show significant kidney dysfunction.

E. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: Would typically present with a positive Coombs test, which is negative in this case.

Abdominal examination shows diffuse mild tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. A focused assessment with sonography shows no obvious free fluid in the pericardium; assessment of the abdomen is equivocal. An x-ray of the chest shows mild opacification of the right lower lobe. Two large-bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. The patient is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is A. Chest tube insertion in the fifth intercostal space at the midaxillary line.

Justification:

The patient presents with a gunshot wound to the right chest, and the chest x-ray shows mild opacification of the right lower lobe, suggesting a possible hemothorax or pneumothorax. The patient's hypotension and tachycardia also suggest significant bleeding. In this scenario, the most appropriate next step is to insert a chest tube to drain any blood or air that may be accumulating in the pleural space. This can help to relieve tension, improve oxygenation, and stabilize the patient's hemodynamics.

Option B, CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, may be useful in evaluating the extent of the patient's injuries, but it is not the most immediate priority. The patient's unstable vital signs and suspected hemothorax or pneumothorax require more urgent attention.

Option C, local wound exploration, is not necessary at this time, as the patient's priority is to address the potential life-threatening injuries to the chest and abdomen.

Option D, exploratory laparotomy, may be necessary if the patient's abdominal examination worsens or if there is evidence of intra-abdominal bleeding, but it is not the most immediate next step.

Option E, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, is a more invasive procedure that may be considered later in the patient's management, but it is not the most appropriate initial step.

"Mutations in the ATP2A1 gene results in loss of function of the calcium ATPase pump, which is in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes of skeletal muscle in humans. This mutation results in a rare disease characterized by muscle cramping and stiffening that is usually most severe after exercise or strenuous activity and is typically relieved after affected individuals rest for a few minutes. Which of the following is expected in individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation?",B,"The correct answer is A. Muscle relaxation time: decreased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased.

Here's why:

The ATP2A1 gene codes for the SERCA1 (Sarcoplasmic/Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase 1) pump, which is responsible for pumping calcium ions from the cytosol back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle cells. This process is crucial for muscle relaxation.

Mutations in the ATP2A1 gene lead to a loss of function of the SERCA1 pump, resulting in an inability to effectively remove calcium ions from the cytosol. This causes an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration.

As a result, muscle relaxation time is decreased, meaning that the muscle takes longer to relax after contraction. This is because the elevated cytosolic calcium concentration prolongs muscle contraction.

The disease characterized by muscle cramping and stiffening, especially after exercise or strenuous activity, is Brody disease, which is caused by mutations in the ATP2A1 gene. The symptoms are typically relieved after rest, as the elevated calcium levels gradually decrease.

The other options are incorrect:

B. Muscle relaxation time would be decreased, not increased, due to the elevated cytosolic calcium concentration.

C. Cytosolic calcium concentration would increase, not decrease or remain unchanged.

D. Muscle relaxation time would be affected, and cytosolic calcium concentration would increase, not decrease.

E. Muscle relaxation time would decrease, not increase, and cytosolic calcium concentration would increase, not decrease.",Success

Aspirin, clopidogrel, sublingual nitroglycerin, and morphine are given immediately and the patient now rates the pain as 4–5 out of 10. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Percutaneous coronary intervention.

The patient's symptoms and ECG findings are consistent with an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The elevated troponins confirm the diagnosis. Given the patient's ongoing symptoms and ECG changes, the best next step is to perform an urgent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore blood flow to the affected coronary artery.

PCI is the recommended treatment for STEMI patients who present within 12 hours of symptom onset, as it has been shown to improve outcomes and reduce mortality compared to fibrinolysis (B). The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend that PCI should be performed within 90 minutes of first medical contact.

Intravenous alteplase (B) is a fibrinolytic agent that may be used for STEMI patients who are not candidates for PCI or when PCI is not available. However, it is not the best option in this scenario, as the patient is already in a unit with continuous cardiac monitoring and PCI is available.

Coronary artery bypass graft (C) is a surgical procedure that may be necessary for patients with complex coronary artery disease, but it is not the best next step in the management of this patient's acute STEMI.

Oral ramipril (D) and oral eplerenone (E) are medications that may be used in the management of heart failure or hypertension, but they are not relevant to the acute management of this patient's STEMI.

The patient's symptoms, such as increasingly severe abdominal pain, nausea, bilious vomiting, and lack of bowel movement or flatus, suggest a diagnosis of small bowel obstruction (SBO). The abdominal ultrasound showing nonpropulsive peristalsis of the small bowel further supports this diagnosis.

Given the patient's history of appendectomy at the age of 39, it is likely that adhesions from the previous surgery are causing the small bowel obstruction. Adhesions are a common complication of abdominal surgery and can lead to SBO.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and diagnosis:

A. Chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is unlikely given the patient's normal liver enzymes and lack of other symptoms suggestive of IBD.

B. Obesity (BMI 35.4 kg/m2) may contribute to the patient's overall health issues, but it is not the primary cause of his current symptoms.

C. Ibuprofen use may cause gastrointestinal upset, but it is not typically associated with small bowel obstruction.

E. Alcohol consumption (two beers daily) is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms, and there is no evidence of alcohol-related liver disease or pancreatitis.

In summary, the patient's history of abdominal surgery, particularly the appendectomy, is the most likely cause of his small bowel obstruction.",Success
A 28-year-old Caucasian woman presents to your office with recurrent abdominal cramping on her left side for 6 months. She additionally reports bloody diarrhea and tenesmus. You suspect ulcerative colitis. Which of the following findings would most strongly confirm your diagnosis?,E,"The correct answer is E. Continuous mucosal damage.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) characterized by chronic inflammation and ulceration of the colonic mucosa. The diagnosis of UC is based on a combination of clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological findings.

Option E, Continuous mucosal damage, is a hallmark feature of ulcerative colitis. In UC, the inflammation and ulceration of the colonic mucosa are continuous, meaning that they affect the entire colon, starting from the rectum and extending proximally in a continuous fashion. This is in contrast to Crohn's disease, which is characterized by skip lesions and transmural inflammation.

Option A, Involvement of terminal ileum, is more characteristic of Crohn's disease, not ulcerative colitis. While it's possible for UC to involve the terminal ileum, this is not a typical feature of the disease.

Option B, No rectal involvement, is incorrect because the rectum is almost always involved in ulcerative colitis.

Option C, Noncaseating granulomas, is a feature of Crohn's disease, not ulcerative colitis. Granulomas are not typically seen in UC.

Option D, Transmural inflammation, is a feature of Crohn's disease, not ulcerative colitis. In UC, the inflammation is typically limited to the mucosa and submucosa, whereas in Crohn's disease, it can extend through all layers of the bowel wall (transmural).

Therefore, the correct answer is E. Continuous mucosal damage, which is a characteristic feature of ulcerative colitis.",Success
"A 6-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for difficulty breathing and bluish discoloration of the lips for the past hour. During the past 3 months, the patient has had several upper respiratory tract infections and poor weight gain. Physical examination shows crackles over both lung fields and enlargement of the tonsils and cervical lymph nodes. His serum IgA, IgE, and IgG titers are decreased. An x-ray of the chest shows bilateral interstitial infiltrates. Methenamine silver staining of bronchial lavage fluid shows disc-shaped cysts. A defect in which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?",B,"The correct answer is E. B-cell maturation.

The patient's symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, bluish discoloration of the lips, and bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray, suggest a respiratory infection. The presence of crackles over both lung fields and enlargement of the tonsils and cervical lymph nodes further support this diagnosis. The decreased serum IgA, IgE, and IgG titers indicate an immunodeficiency disorder, specifically a B-cell defect.

The methenamine silver staining of bronchial lavage fluid showing disc-shaped cysts is consistent with the diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised individuals.

Given the patient's age, symptoms, and laboratory results, the most likely underlying cause is a defect in B-cell maturation, leading to a primary immunodeficiency disorder, such as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) or Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). This defect impairs the production of antibodies, making the patient susceptible to recurrent infections, including PJP.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Actin filament assembly is involved in cell migration and cytoskeleton organization, but it is not directly related to immunodeficiency or PJP.

B. T-cell receptor signaling is important for T-cell activation and immune response, but it is not the primary defect in this patient's condition.

C. Thymus organogenesis is crucial for T-cell development, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

D. Microtubule polymerization is involved in cell division and cytoskeleton organization, but it is not directly related to immunodeficiency or PJP.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is a defect in B-cell maturation (option E).",Success

A subsequent flow cytometry test demonstrates CD20+ cells. What is the most likely finding you would expect in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Presence of smudge cells.

The patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). The presence of CD20+ cells on flow cytometry supports this diagnosis. CLL is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, characterized by an abnormal increase in mature lymphocytes.

Smudge cells are a characteristic feature of CLL. They are damaged lymphocytes that appear as smudged or broken cells on a peripheral blood smear. This is due to the fragility of CLL cells, which are prone to breaking apart during the preparation of the blood smear.

The other options are not directly related to CLL:

A. Low levels of erythropoietin: This might be seen in anemia of chronic disease or kidney disease, but it is not a characteristic finding in CLL.

B. Low levels of leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP): This is a feature of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML), not CLL.

C. Myeloperoxidase positive cytoplasmic inclusions: This is a feature of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), not CLL.

D. Presence of hairy cells: This is a characteristic feature of Hairy Cell Leukemia, a different type of blood cancer.

Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient would be the presence of smudge cells on a peripheral blood smear.",Success
"A 81-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he fell asleep at the dinner table and was not able to be roused by his family. His past medical history is significant for Alzheimer disease though he is still relatively functional at baseline. He has also been taking warfarin over the last 3 months after he suffered a deep venous thrombosis. After he was transported to the ED, his family found that the pills his grandson takes for seizures were missing. On presentation, he is found to be somnolent and physical exam reveals ataxia and nystagmus. After determining the cause of this patient's symptoms, his physicians begin monitoring his international normalized ratio, because they are concerned that it will start trending down. Which of the following treatments would most improve the urinary excretion of the substance likely responsible for these symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Sodium bicarbonate.

Based on the patient's symptoms, such as somnolence, ataxia, and nystagmus, and the fact that his grandson's seizure medication is missing, it is likely that the patient has ingested phenytoin (Dilantin), an anticonvulsant. Phenytoin can cause these symptoms, especially in older adults.

The physicians are concerned that the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) will trend down because warfarin and phenytoin interact, with phenytoin decreasing the effectiveness of warfarin.

To improve the urinary excretion of phenytoin, sodium bicarbonate is the correct treatment. Phenytoin is a weak acid, and alkalization of the urine with sodium bicarbonate can increase its urinary excretion by trapping the ionized form of the drug in the urine, thereby enhancing its elimination.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Ammonium chloride is an acidifying agent that would decrease the urinary excretion of phenytoin.

B. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is a chelating agent used to treat heavy metal poisoning, but it is not relevant to phenytoin toxicity.

C. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that can increase urinary excretion of some substances, but it is not specific to phenytoin and may not be effective in this case.

E. Thiazide diuretics can actually increase the toxicity of phenytoin by decreasing its excretion, so they would not be a suitable treatment option.

It's essential to note that activated charcoal and supportive care are also important in managing phenytoin toxicity, but the question specifically asks about improving urinary excretion, making sodium bicarbonate the correct answer.",Success

Which of the following is the most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""",A,"The correct answer is A. Thick and thin blood smear.

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is malaria, specifically Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium falciparum infection. The patient's recent travel to northern Brazil, high-grade fever, myalgia, and generalized fatigue are consistent with malaria. The laboratory results showing jaundice, anemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels support this diagnosis.

A thick and thin blood smear is the gold standard for diagnosing malaria. The thick smear allows for the detection of parasites in the blood, while the thin smear enables species identification. The presence of Plasmodium parasites in the blood smear would confirm the diagnosis of malaria.

The other options are not directly related to confirming the diagnosis of malaria:

B. Direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is used to diagnose autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

C. Enzyme testing may be used to diagnose enzyme deficiencies, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which can cause hemolytic anemia. However, this is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

D. Sickle cell test is used to diagnose sickle cell disease, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

E. Ultrasound of the abdomen may be used to evaluate abdominal pain or suspected liver or spleen disease, but it is not relevant to diagnosing malaria.

"A 56-year-old woman presents to a physician with severe pain and swelling of the left inguinal area for 3 days. She has a fever and malaise. Last week she noted several painless red papules on her left thigh when she was on a summer trip to Madagascar. She has no history of serious illnesses and is on no medications. There has been no recent contact with any animals or pets. The temperature is 38.6℃ (101.5℉), the pulse is 78/min, the respiration rate is 12/min, and the blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg. Swelling of the left inguinal area was noted; however, there were no skin changes. Several large, tense, and tender lymph nodes with a boggy consistency were palpated in the inguinal region. The right inguinal area is normal on physical exam. There was no lymphadenopathy in other areas. No abnormalities existed in the lungs, heart, and abdomen. Microscopic examination of pus from the inguinal lymph nodes revealed gram-negative Coccobacilli. Serum anti-F1 titers show a 4-fold rise. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time?",D,"The correct answer is D. Streptomycin.

The patient's symptoms, including severe pain and swelling of the left inguinal area, fever, and malaise, along with the presence of painless red papules on her left thigh, suggest a diagnosis of bubonic plague. The microscopic examination of pus from the inguinal lymph nodes revealing gram-negative Coccobacilli and the 4-fold rise in serum anti-F1 titers support this diagnosis.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), the treatment of choice for bubonic plague is streptomycin, which is a bactericidal antibiotic effective against Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague. Streptomycin is recommended for 10 days, and gentamicin is an acceptable alternative.

Azithromycin (Option A) is not a recommended treatment for bubonic plague. Imipenem (Option B) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, but it is not specifically recommended for plague treatment. Chloramphenicol (Option C) is not a recommended treatment for bubonic plague, and its use is generally reserved for meningitis or septicemic plague. No pharmacotherapy (Option E) is not an appropriate choice, as prompt antibiotic treatment is essential to prevent complications and mortality.

It's worth noting that the patient's travel history to Madagascar, an endemic area for plague, and the presence of painless red papules on her thigh, which are likely buboes, further support the diagnosis of bubonic plague.",Success
"A 60-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of sudden, painless loss of vision in her right eye that occurred 30 minutes ago while watching TV. She has coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus; she has had trouble adhering to her medication regimen. Her blood pressure is 160/85 mm Hg. Examination shows 20/50 vision in the left eye and no perception of light in the right eye. Direct pupillary reflex is present in the left eye, but absent in the right eye. Accommodation is intact bilaterally. Intraocular pressure is 16 mm Hg in the left eye and 18 mm Hg in the right eye. Fundoscopic examination of the right eye shows a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula. The optic disc appears normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Central retinal artery occlusion.

Here's why:

* The patient's sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye is consistent with a vascular event.
* The fundoscopic examination showing a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula, also known as a ""cherry-red spot,"" is a classic finding in central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO).
* The presence of a normal optic disc and intact accommodation bilaterally rules out anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), which typically affects the optic disc.
* The absence of pain and lack of elevated intraocular pressure make acute angle-closure glaucoma unlikely.
* Retinal detachment would typically present with a detached retina, which is not described in this scenario.
* Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) would typically present with a more gradual onset of vision loss, and the fundoscopic examination would show a more extensive hemorrhage and edema.

CRAO is a medical emergency that requires prompt evaluation and treatment to restore blood flow to the retina. The patient's history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus increases her risk for CRAO.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American Academy of Ophthalmology, recommend immediate evaluation and treatment of CRAO, including prompt referral to an ophthalmologist and possible treatment with ocular massage, anterior chamber paracentesis, or thrombolysis.",Success
"A previously healthy 35-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of sudden weakness of her right arm and leg that started 3 hours ago.

Her temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 115/min and regular, and blood pressure is 155/85 mm Hg. Examination shows decreased muscle strength on the entire right side. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ on the right. Babinski sign is present on the right. The left lower leg is swollen, erythematous, and tender to palpation. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following?",A,"The correct answer is A. Patent foramen ovale.

Here's why:

The patient presents with sudden onset of weakness in her right arm and leg, which suggests a neurological deficit. The examination findings of decreased muscle strength, increased deep tendon reflexes, and a positive Babinski sign on the right side are consistent with a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). The patient's history of smoking and oral contraceptive use increases her risk for thromboembolic events.

The key clue in this scenario is the swollen, erythematous, and tender left lower leg, which suggests deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The combination of DVT and a neurological deficit on the opposite side of the body (right arm and leg) raises the suspicion of a paradoxical embolus.

A paradoxical embolus occurs when a thrombus forms in the venous system, passes through a patent foramen ovale (PFO), and then embolizes to the arterial system, causing a stroke or TIA. PFO is a common congenital heart defect that affects approximately 25% of the population.

The other options are less likely:

B. Atrial myxoma is a rare cardiac tumor that can cause embolic events, but it is not typically associated with DVT.

C. Mitral valve vegetation is more commonly seen in infective endocarditis, which is not suggested by the patient's presentation.

D. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

E. Carotid artery dissection is a possible cause of stroke, but it is not typically associated with DVT or a paradoxical embolus.

Therefore, further evaluation is most likely to show a patent foramen ovale (PFO) as the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.",Success

The patient is immediately started on a bolus of intravenous (IV) 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl). Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",D,"The correct answer is C. Start IV insulin infusion.

This patient presents with symptoms and laboratory results consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of diabetes. The patient's high blood glucose level (630 mg/dL), acidotic state (pH 7.1), and presence of ketones in the urine confirm the diagnosis.

The next best step in managing this patient is to start an IV insulin infusion. Insulin is essential to correct the metabolic acidosis and hyperglycemia. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends initiating insulin therapy with a continuous IV infusion of regular insulin at a rate of 0.1 units/kg/hour.

Option A, infusing sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), is not recommended in the initial management of DKA unless the patient's pH is < 6.9. In this case, the pH is 7.1, which is not severe enough to warrant bicarbonate therapy.

Option B, switching to 0.45% NaCl, is not indicated at this time. The patient is currently receiving 0.9% NaCl, which is appropriate for initial fluid resuscitation in DKA.

Option D, replacing potassium intravenously, is important in the management of DKA, but it should be done concurrently with insulin therapy, not before. Potassium levels can drop rapidly with insulin administration, so it's essential to monitor and replace potassium as needed.

Option E, starting IV 5% dextrose, is not indicated in this patient, as they are severely hyperglycemic. Dextrose is typically added to IV fluids when the patient's blood glucose level falls below 200-250 mg/dL to prevent hypoglycemia.

In summary, the next best step in managing this patient with DKA is to start an IV insulin infusion to correct the metabolic acidosis and hyperglycemia.",Success

The patient's symptoms, including altered mental status, lethargy, hypothermia (rectal temperature of 32°C or 89.6°F), bradycardia (pulse of 54/min), and respiratory depression (respirations of 8/min), are consistent with a sulfonylurea overdose. Tolbutamide is a sulfonylurea medication used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The other symptoms, such as weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes, dilated and poorly reactive pupils, and the patient's attempt to remove his clothing, are also compatible with a sulfonylurea overdose. Sulfonylureas can cause hypoglycemia, which can lead to these neurological symptoms.

The other options are less likely to be the cause of these findings:

A. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor used to treat hypertension, and it is not typically associated with these symptoms.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as tiredness and lethargy, are non-specific but can be related to anemia (hemoglobin level of 8.6 gm/dL) and kidney disease (serum creatinine of 4.6 mg/dL).
* The presence of proteinuria (3+ on urinalysis) suggests kidney damage.
* The renal biopsy findings of hypercellular glomeruli with electron-dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane are characteristic of MPGN.
* The presence of C3 nephritic factor, which is an autoantibody that stabilizes the alternative complement pathway C3 convertase, is often associated with MPGN.
* The absence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) makes lupus nephritis less likely.
* Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is typically seen in children and young adults, and the biopsy findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.
* Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a clinical syndrome characterized by rapid loss of kidney function, which is not described in this patient. The biopsy findings are also not consistent with RPGN.
* Minimal change disease is typically seen in children and is characterized by a normal-appearing glomerulus on light microscopy, which is not consistent with the biopsy findings in this patient.
* Membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) is characterized by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane due to immune complex deposition, which is not consistent with the biopsy findings in this patient.

""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.
Source of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health""",D,"The correct answer is D. It reflects a smaller sample size.

The standard error (SE) is a measure of the variability of a sample mean. A larger standard error indicates greater variability in the sample means. In this case, the standard error surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups.

The reason for this increased standard error is likely due to the smaller sample size in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group. At the 12-month follow-up, there were only 202 participants in this group, compared to 388 participants in the pulmharkimab 75 mg/day group and 395 participants in the placebo group. A smaller sample size can lead to a larger standard error, as there is less precision in estimating the population mean.

The other options are not correct:

A. Increased standard error does not necessarily indicate bias.

B. External validity refers to the generalizability of the study findings to other populations, which is not related to the standard error.

C. Statistical significance is determined by the p-value, not the standard error.

E. Narrower confidence intervals would indicate a smaller standard error, not a larger one.",Success
"A 63-year-old man with diverticular disease comes to the emergency department because of painless rectal bleeding, dizziness, and lightheadedness for 2 hours. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.6°F), pulse is 115/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 86/60 mm Hg. He appears pale. Physical examination shows bright red rectal bleeding. Colonoscopy shows profuse diverticular bleeding; endoscopic hemostasis is performed. After initiating fluid resuscitation, the patient becomes hemodynamically stable. The following day, laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 8 g/dL
Leukocyte count 15,500/mm3
Platelet count 170,000/mm3

Urea nitrogen 60 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.1 mg/dL
Bilirubin
Total 1.2 mg/dL
Indirect 0.3 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase 96 U/L
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT, GPT) 2,674 U/L
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, GOT) 2,254 U/L
Which of the following cells in the patient's liver were most likely damaged first?""",E,"The correct answer is E. Centrilobular hepatocytes.

Here's why:

The patient's laboratory results show significantly elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which are liver enzymes that are released into the bloodstream when liver cells are damaged. The AST:ALT ratio is approximately 1:1, which suggests that the liver damage is likely due to ischemia or hypoxia.

In this scenario, the patient's hypotension (blood pressure of 86/60 mmHg) and tachycardia (pulse of 115/min) suggest that they experienced a period of hypoperfusion, which can lead to ischemic injury to the liver. The liver's centrifugal region, which includes the centrilobular hepatocytes, is the most susceptible to ischemic injury due to its relatively low oxygen tension.

Centrilobular hepatocytes are located around the central vein and are the first to be affected by ischemia or hypoxia. Damage to these cells would release liver enzymes, such as AST and ALT, into the bloodstream, leading to the elevated levels seen in this patient.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's presentation:

A. Hepatic stellate (Ito) cells are involved in fibrosis and are not typically damaged in ischemic liver injury.

B. Periportal hepatocytes are located near the portal triad and are not as susceptible to ischemic injury as centrilobular hepatocytes.

C. Hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells are involved in the regulation of blood flow and are not directly related to liver enzyme release.

D. Hepatic Kupffer cells are part of the reticuloendothelial system and are involved in phagocytosis, but they are not typically damaged in ischemic liver injury.

Therefore, the correct answer is E. Centrilobular hepatocytes.",Success
"A 32-year-old man is brought by ambulance to the emergency room after being involved in a head-on motor vehicle collision at high speed. The patient was found unconscious by the paramedics and regained consciousness briefly during the ambulance ride. Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient’s vitals show: pulse 110/min, respiratory rate 12/min, blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination reveals an unresponsive man with multiple bruises across the chest and along the upper arms with a laceration on the forehead. His is unresponsive to verbal commands and physical touch. His GCS is 6/15. The right pupil is fixed and dilated. An urgent noncontrast CT of the head is performed and shown in the image. The patient is prepared for emergency neurosurgery. Which of the following anesthesia medications would be the best option for this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Propofol.

The patient is presenting with a severe head injury, as evidenced by the low GCS score and the fixed and dilated right pupil, which suggests increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The CT scan shows a large epidural hematoma, which requires emergency neurosurgery.

When choosing an anesthetic agent for this patient, the primary concern is to minimize the risk of further increasing ICP. Propofol is the best option for several reasons:

1. **Cerebral protection**: Propofol has been shown to decrease cerebral blood flow and metabolism, which can help reduce ICP.
2. **Rapid induction and recovery**: Propofol allows for rapid induction and recovery, which is essential in emergency neurosurgery where time is critical.
3. **Minimal effect on blood pressure**: Propofol tends to maintain blood pressure, which is important in patients with head injuries to ensure adequate cerebral perfusion.
4. **Low risk of seizures**: Propofol has anticonvulsant properties, which is beneficial in patients with head injuries who are at risk of seizures.

In contrast, the other options are not ideal for this patient:

* **Halothane (B)**: It can increase cerebral blood flow and ICP, making it a poor choice for patients with head injuries.
* **Midazolam (C)**: While it can be used for rapid sequence induction, midazolam can cause hypotension, which may compromise cerebral perfusion.
* **Nitrous oxide (D)**: It can increase cerebral blood flow and ICP, and its use is generally discouraged in patients with head injuries.
* **Sevoflurane (E)**: While it is a commonly used anesthetic agent, sevoflurane can increase cerebral blood flow and ICP, making it a less desirable choice for this patient.

In summary, propofol is the best anesthetic medication for this patient due to its ability to reduce ICP, provide rapid induction and recovery, and maintain blood pressure.",Success
"A 25-year-old female presents to urgent care with complaints of one day of burning and pain with urination, urgency, and frequency. She denies having a fever but has experienced intermittent chills. She is sexually active and inconsistently uses condoms. The patient has no past medical history. She is allergic to sulfa drugs. Physical examination of the genitalia is normal. Urinalysis shows positive leukocyte esterase and nitrites. The urine culture demonstrates gram-negative rods that form pink colonies on MacConkey agar. She is treated with an antibiotic and her symptoms quickly improve. The mechanism of the antibiotic she was most likely treated with is which of the following?",A,"The correct answer is A. Inhibits cell wall synthesis.

Based on the patient's symptoms and urinalysis results, it is likely that she has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by a gram-negative rod, such as E. coli. The fact that the urine culture demonstrates pink colonies on MacConkey agar further supports this diagnosis, as E. coli typically forms pink colonies on this medium.

Given the patient's allergy to sulfa drugs, it is likely that she was treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic, such as cephalexin or amoxicillin, which are commonly used to treat UTIs caused by E. coli. Beta-lactam antibiotics work by inhibiting cell wall synthesis, which is essential for bacterial growth and survival.

Option A is the correct answer because beta-lactam antibiotics, such as cephalexin or amoxicillin, inhibit cell wall synthesis by binding to the enzyme responsible for peptidoglycan synthesis, thereby preventing the formation of the bacterial cell wall.

Option B is incorrect because it describes the mechanism of action of glycopeptide antibiotics, such as vancomycin, which are not typically used to treat UTIs caused by E. coli.

Option C is incorrect because it describes the mechanism of action of aminoglycoside antibiotics, which are not typically used as first-line treatment for UTIs.

Option D is incorrect because it describes the mechanism of action of tetracycline antibiotics, which are not typically used to treat UTIs caused by E. coli.

Option E is incorrect because it describes the mechanism of action of antifungal medications, which are not relevant to the treatment of bacterial UTIs.",Success
"A 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation comes to the physician for shortness of breath with mild exertion, progressive weakness, and a dry cough that has persisted for 6 months. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 45 years. His medications include warfarin, enalapril, and amiodarone. His pulse is 85/min and irregularly irregular. Physical examination shows enlarged fingertips and markedly curved nails. A CT scan of the chest shows clustered air spaces and reticular opacities in the basal parts of the lung. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's dyspnea?",E,"The correct answer is E. Excess collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix of the lung.

The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and CT scan results are consistent with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic and progressive lung disease characterized by scarring of the lung tissue. The enlarged fingertips and curved nails (megalonychia) are indicative of clubbing, which is a common finding in patients with IPF.

The underlying mechanism of dyspnea in IPF is the deposition of excess collagen in the extracellular matrix of the lung, leading to fibrosis and scarring. This scarring causes the lung tissue to become stiff and non-compliant, making it difficult for the lungs to expand and for oxygen to be transferred into the bloodstream, resulting in dyspnea.

Option A, chronic airway inflammation, is more characteristic of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings.

Option B, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and obstruction, is more characteristic of asthma, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings.

Option C, fluid leak into the interstitium and alveoli, is more characteristic of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pulmonary edema, which is not supported by the patient's chronic symptoms and CT scan findings.

Option D, pleural scarring, may be a component of IPF, but it is not the primary underlying mechanism of dyspnea in this patient.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of smoking and use of amiodarone may be contributing factors to the development of IPF, but the underlying mechanism of dyspnea is still the excess collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix of the lung.",Success
"A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his mother after being found lying unconscious next to a bottle of pills. The patient’s mother mentions that he has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder 3 years ago for which he was taking a medication that resulted in only a slight improvement in his symptoms. She says he still found it difficult to concentrate on his studies and did not participate in any social events in college. He didn’t have many friends and was often found sitting alone in his room. He has also threatened to take his life on several occasions, but she did not think he was serious. While recording his vital signs, the patient goes into a coma. His ECG shows a QT interval of 450 milliseconds. Which of the following medications did this patient most likely overdose on?",E,"The correct answer is D. Citalopram.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms and history suggest that he was taking an antidepressant medication, likely a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which is a common class of medications used to treat major depressive disorder.
* The patient's ECG shows a QT interval of 450 milliseconds, which is prolonged. Citalopram is known to cause QT interval prolongation, particularly at high doses or in overdose situations.
* Among the options, citalopram is the most likely culprit due to its known effects on the QT interval. While other SSRIs like sertraline (option B) may also cause QT prolongation, it is less likely to cause a significant prolongation like the one seen in this patient.
* Bupropion (option A) is an atypical antidepressant that is not typically associated with QT prolongation.
* Venlafaxine (option C) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that can cause QT prolongation, but it is less likely to cause a prolongation as significant as the one seen in this patient.
* Clomipramine (option E) is a tricyclic antidepressant that can cause QT prolongation, but it is an older medication that is less commonly used today, and its effects on the QT interval are generally less pronounced compared to citalopram.

It's worth noting that citalopram has a black box warning from the FDA regarding the risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia. This warning is particularly relevant in overdose situations, as seen in this patient.",Success
"In a study to determine the risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age (age < 30 years), 30 young patients with the condition are recruited into the study group. Sixty similar but healthy individuals are recruited into the control group. Educational status is considered to be an important variable, as it would affect the awareness of the disease and its risk factors among the participants. Based on the level of education, 2 groups are formed: low educational status and high educational status. A chi-square test is performed to test the significance of the relationship, and an odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9–9.7. What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?",A,"The correct answer is A. The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.

Here's why:

* The odds ratio (OR) of 2.1 suggests that individuals with low educational status may be more likely to experience myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age. However, the confidence interval (CI) ranges from 0.9 to 9.7, which includes 1. This means that the true OR may be as low as 0.9 (indicating a protective effect) or as high as 9.7 (indicating a strong association).
* Since the CI includes 1, the association between low education and MI is not statistically significant. In other words, we cannot conclude that low education is a risk factor for MI at a young age based on this study.
* The chi-square test result is not provided, but the CI including 1 suggests that the p-value would be greater than 0.05, indicating a non-significant association.

Therefore, option A is the correct inference: the association between young age MI and educational status is not statistically significant, and low education cannot be concluded to be a risk factor.",Success
"A 32-year-old primigravid woman at 16 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal visit. She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F) and blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 16-week gestation. A quadruple screening test shows maternal serum AFP of 3 times the median and normal levels of serum β-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A. Which of the following is most likely to account for these findings?",C,"The correct answer is C. Neural tube defect.

Here's why:

The quadruple screening test measures four biomarkers in the maternal serum: alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG), estriol, and inhibin A. The results of this test can help identify potential fetal abnormalities.

In this case, the patient's quadruple screening test shows:

* Maternal serum AFP of 3 times the median (elevated)
* Normal levels of serum β-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A

Elevated maternal serum AFP is a strong indicator of a neural tube defect (NTD), such as spina bifida or anencephaly. This is because AFP is produced by the fetal liver and yolk sac, and in NTDs, the defect in the neural tube allows AFP to leak into the amniotic fluid and then into the maternal bloodstream, resulting in elevated levels.

The other options can be ruled out based on the test results:

* A. Fetal hydrocephalus: While hydrocephalus can cause elevated AFP, it is not typically associated with a 3-fold increase in AFP levels.
* B. Partial molar pregnancy: This condition would likely cause elevated β-hCG levels, which are normal in this patient.
* D. Trisomy 18: This chromosomal abnormality is associated with low levels of AFP, estriol, and inhibin A, which is not consistent with this patient's test results.
* E. Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome): Trisomy 21 is associated with low levels of AFP and estriol, and elevated levels of β-hCG and inhibin A, which is not consistent with this patient's test results.

Therefore, based on the elevated AFP level and normal levels of other biomarkers, a neural tube defect is the most likely explanation for these findings.",Success
"A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of a sharp pain that radiates along his right hemithorax, which worsens with deep inspiration. He says this started abruptly about 6 hours ago. He says that he has not noticed that anything that makes his pain better or worse. He also denies any other symptoms. He works as a long-haul truck driver, and he informs you that he recently returned to the east coast from a trip to Utah. His medical history is significant for gout, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia from when he was a child. He currently smokes 2 packs of cigarettes/day, drinks a 6-pack of beer/day, and he denies any illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. His physical examination shows minimal bibasilar rales, but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, normal heart sounds, and a benign abdominal physical examination. Which of the following is the most reasonable 1st step towards ruling out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. D-dimer.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the sharp pain that radiates along his right hemithorax and worsens with deep inspiration, raise suspicion for pulmonary embolism (PE). Given the patient's low-risk profile, the most reasonable first step towards ruling out PE is to perform a D-dimer test.

D-dimer is a sensitive test that measures the levels of fibrin degradation products in the blood, which are elevated in the presence of thrombus formation. A negative D-dimer result (typically <500 ng/mL) can effectively rule out PE in low-risk patients, as it has a high negative predictive value. This is because D-dimer has a high sensitivity for PE, meaning that a negative result makes PE unlikely.

The other options are not the most reasonable first step for the following reasons:

A. ECG: While an electrocardiogram (ECG) may show signs of right heart strain or ischemia in patients with PE, it is not a sensitive or specific test for diagnosing PE.

B. V/Q scan: A ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan is a diagnostic test for PE, but it is not the first step in the diagnostic workup, especially in low-risk patients. V/Q scans are typically reserved for patients with contraindications to CT pulmonary angiogram or when the diagnosis is still uncertain after CT.

D. Lower extremity venous ultrasound: While ultrasound can diagnose deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a risk factor for PE, it is not a direct test for PE.

E. CT pulmonary angiogram with IV contrast: While CT pulmonary angiogram is a highly sensitive and specific test for PE, it is not the first step in the diagnostic workup, especially in low-risk patients. CT pulmonary angiogram exposes patients to radiation and contrast dye, so it should be reserved for patients with a higher pre-test probability of PE or those with a positive D-dimer result.

In this patient, a negative D-dimer result would suggest that PE is unlikely, and further testing may not be necessary. However, if the D-dimer result is positive or indeterminate, further diagnostic testing, such as CT pulmonary angiogram or V/Q scan, may be warranted.",Success
"A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of her right hand. Specifically, she says that she was gardening 8 hours prior to presentation when she sustained a laceration over her distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. Since then, they have become red and swollen. She has also had pain in her proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints for several years and reports that this pain is worse in the morning but improves over the day. The cells that are present in this patient's DIP joints and PIP joints are analyzed and compared. Which of the following is most likely to be true about this patient's findings?",C,"The correct answer is B. DIP has fewer neutrophils and more monocytes than PIP.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation suggests two separate conditions: an acute injury to the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, likely causing an inflammatory response, and a chronic condition affecting the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, consistent with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

In the acute setting of a laceration, the DIP joints would likely exhibit an inflammatory response characterized by an influx of neutrophils. However, in chronic conditions like OA or RA, the inflammatory response is more chronic and involves a predominance of monocytes and macrophages.

Given these differences in the underlying pathophysiology, it is likely that the DIP joints would have fewer neutrophils and more monocytes compared to the PIP joints. This is because the DIP joints are responding to an acute injury, whereas the PIP joints are affected by a chronic inflammatory condition.

Therefore, option B is the most likely correct answer.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a severe headache. She states it is 10/10 in intensity and states that it is associated with chewing.

Her temperature is 97.0°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 111/74 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for pain and tenderness over the mandibular and temporal region that is worsened when the patient opens and closes their mouth. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Temporomandibular joint dysfunction.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, specifically the severe headache associated with chewing, pain and tenderness over the mandibular and temporal region, and worsening of symptoms when opening and closing the mouth, point towards Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) dysfunction. The TMJ is a complex joint that connects the jawbone to the skull, and dysfunction can cause pain and tenderness in the surrounding areas.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following reasons:

A. Migraine headache: While migraines can cause severe headaches, they are typically not associated with chewing or jaw movement. Additionally, migraines often have other symptoms such as sensitivity to light and sound, nausea, and vomiting, which are not mentioned in this scenario.

B. Subarachnoid hemorrhage: This is a life-threatening condition that typically presents with a sudden, severe headache, often described as the ""worst headache of my life."" The patient's vital signs, including temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, are within normal limits, making this diagnosis less likely.

C. Temporal arteritis: This condition typically affects older adults (>50 years) and presents with a new-onset headache, often accompanied by fever, jaw claudication, and scalp tenderness. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.

E. Tension headache: While tension headaches can cause dull pain over the sides of the head, they are not typically associated with chewing or jaw movement. Additionally, tension headaches are often described as a band or a squeezing sensation around the forehead, which is not mentioned in this scenario.

In conclusion, based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, Temporomandibular Joint dysfunction is the most likely diagnosis.",Success

His hemoglobin concentration is 12.9 g/dL, leukocyte count is 10,600/mm3, and platelet count is 230,000/mm3. An x-ray of the chest in supine position is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Atelectasis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including shortness of breath and reduced breath sounds over the left lung base, are consistent with a respiratory issue. Given the patient's recent surgery and the supine position of the chest x-ray, atelectasis is the most likely cause.

Atelectasis is a common complication of general anesthesia and surgery, particularly in the postoperative period. It occurs when a segment of the lung collapses or becomes airless, leading to reduced lung volume and impaired gas exchange. The supine position can exacerbate atelectasis, as gravity can cause the lung tissue to collapse further.

The patient's history of asthma (Option A) is unlikely to be the primary cause of his symptoms, as he is well-controlled on his albuterol inhaler and there is no mention of wheezing or other asthma-related symptoms.

Pneumonitis (Option B) is also unlikely, as the patient's temperature is normal, and there is no mention of cough, sputum, or other signs of infection.

Pulmonary embolism (Option C) is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms and examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's calves are soft and nontender, which reduces the likelihood of deep vein thrombosis, a common precursor to pulmonary embolism.

Congestive heart failure (Option E) is also unlikely, as the patient's cardiac examination is normal, and there is no mention of jugular venous distension, edema, or other signs of heart failure.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and examination findings, combined with the supine position of the chest x-ray, make atelectasis the most likely cause of his shortness of breath.",Success

There is drooping of the left side of the face. Muscle strength is decreased in the left upper and lower extremities. Plantar reflex shows an extensor response on the left side. Speech is dysarthric. There is a bruit on the right side of the neck. Fundoscopy shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum concentrations of glucose and electrolytes are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",E,"The correct answer is E. CT scan of the head.

This patient is presenting with acute onset of facial drooping, weakness in the left upper and lower extremities, dysarthric speech, and an extensor plantar response on the left side, which suggests a diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke. The patient's history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking increases his risk for cerebrovascular disease.

The most appropriate next step in management is to perform a non-contrast CT scan of the head to rule out intracranial hemorrhage and to assess for early signs of ischemia. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines recommend a non-contrast CT scan as the initial imaging study in patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke.

While MRI of the brain (Option A) is a more sensitive test for detecting acute ischemic stroke, it is not the most appropriate initial test in this scenario. MRI may be delayed due to availability and patient factors, and it may not be necessary to make a decision about thrombolytic therapy.

Lumbar puncture (Option B) is not indicated in this scenario, as it is not a diagnostic test for ischemic stroke and may be contraindicated in patients with acute stroke due to the risk of herniation.

Duplex ultrasonography of the neck (Option C) may be useful in evaluating for carotid stenosis, but it is not the most immediate concern in this scenario. The patient's symptoms suggest an acute ischemic stroke, and the priority is to rule out intracranial hemorrhage and assess for ischemia.

Cerebral angiography (Option D) is an invasive test that may be used to evaluate for vascular stenosis or occlusion, but it is not the initial test of choice in this scenario.

In summary, a non-contrast CT scan of the head is the most appropriate next step in management to rule out intracranial hemorrhage and assess for early signs of ischemia in this patient with suspected acute ischemic stroke.",Success
"A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss.

High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/μL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses.

After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm × 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/μL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",E,"The correct answer is A. Stop antiretroviral therapy and continue antitubercular therapy.

The patient is experiencing a paradoxical reaction, also known as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is a common complication of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) co-infection. IRIS occurs when the immune system recovers and responds to the presence of TB antigens, leading to an inflammatory response.

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, increased cough, and generalized lymphadenopathy, along with the radiographic findings of pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, are consistent with IRIS. The significant improvement in CD4+ T cell count and decrease in HIV RNA levels also support this diagnosis.

The initial step in treatment is to stop the antiretroviral therapy (ART) to reduce the inflammatory response. Continuing antitubercular therapy is essential to ensure that the patient's TB infection is adequately treated.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because changing the antiretroviral or antitubercular regimens is not the primary step in managing IRIS. Option E is also incorrect because continuing both therapies without any change may exacerbate the IRIS reaction.

It's essential to note that IRIS is usually self-limiting and resolves with supportive care. In some cases, corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation. However, the primary step is to stop the ART and continue the antitubercular therapy.",Success

On physical examination, there is erythema, tenderness and enlargement of the thyroid gland that is worse on the left. Pain is worsened during neck hyperextension and relieved during neck flexion. Thyroid function tests are within normal limits. An ultrasound of the thyroid gland reveals a unifocal perithyroidal hypoechoic space. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism underlying this patient’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Pyriform sinus fistula.

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, malaise, and intense pain in the anterior neck, along with the physical examination findings of erythema, tenderness, and enlargement of the thyroid gland, suggest an inflammatory process. The ultrasound finding of a unifocal perithyroidal hypoechoic space is consistent with an abscess.

The most likely mechanism underlying this patient's condition is a pyriform sinus fistula, which is a congenital anomaly that can lead to a perithyroidal abscess. The pyriform sinus is a narrow channel that connects the thyroid gland to the trachea, and a fistula can form between the two structures. This can lead to the accumulation of infected material in the perithyroidal space, causing the symptoms and findings seen in this patient.

Option A, postviral inflammatory process, is unlikely to cause a unifocal perithyroidal hypoechoic space on ultrasound. Option C, antithyroid peroxidase (TPO), is an antibody associated with autoimmune thyroiditis, which does not typically present with an abscess. Option D, perithyroidal fibrosis, is a condition that can cause thyroid gland enlargement, but it is not typically associated with an abscess or fever. Option E, autoantibodies to the thyrotropin receptor (TRAb), is associated with Graves' disease, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings.

A 65-year-old previously healthy man presents to the primary care physician with the chief complaint of red colored urine over the past month. He states that he does not experience dysuria. On physical exam there is no costovertebral angle tenderness. With this presentation which is the most likely cause of this patient's hematuria?,A,"The correct answer is A. Bladder tumor.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation with red-colored urine (hematuria) without dysuria (painful urination) or costovertebral angle tenderness (which would suggest kidney stone or pyelonephritis) points towards a lower urinary tract origin. The lack of dysuria also makes urinary tract infection (UTI) less likely.

Beeturia (option C) is a rare condition where urine turns red or pink due to the ingestion of beets. While it's an interesting possibility, it's unlikely to be the cause of hematuria in this patient.

Urethral injury (option E) is also unlikely, as the patient doesn't report any trauma or symptoms suggestive of urethral injury.

Renal cell carcinoma (option B) can cause hematuria, but it's more likely to present with other symptoms such as flank pain, weight loss, or a palpable abdominal mass.

Bladder tumor (option A) is a common cause of painless hematuria in older adults. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms make bladder tumor a more likely explanation for his hematuria.

The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines recommend that patients with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria undergo a workup, including cystoscopy and imaging studies, to rule out bladder cancer.",Success
"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother with confusion, abdominal pain, and vomiting for the previous day. The patient’s mother says he started complaining of pain in his abdomen after he got back from school yesterday and vomited 3 times during the night. This morning, he seemed confused so she rushed him to the ER. She has also noticed that he has been urinating frequently and drinking a lot of water recently, and he has lost 6 kg (13.2 lb) over the past 20 days. His vital signs include: blood pressure 100/50 mm Hg, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 27/min, and temperature 35.6°C (96.0°F). His BMI is 18 kg/m2. On physical examination, he is disoriented to time and place and is taking deep and labored breaths. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation in the abdomen with guarding. Laboratory tests are significant for a pH of 7.19 and a blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL. The doctor explains to his mother that her son has developed a life-threatening complication of a disease characterized by decreased levels of a hormone. Which of the following would you most likely expect to see in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. The patient's high blood glucose level (754 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH 7.19), and Kussmaul breathing (deep and labored breaths) are all indicative of DKA.

In diabetes mellitus, there is a deficiency of insulin, a hormone that regulates glucose metabolism. Insulin promotes glucose uptake by adipocytes (fat cells) and inhibits glucose production in the liver. Without sufficient insulin, glucose uptake by adipocytes is decreased, leading to hyperglycemia.

The other options are not directly related to the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus or DKA:

B. Decreased activity of hormone-sensitive lipase: Hormone-sensitive lipase is an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides in adipose tissue. Its activity is increased in diabetes, not decreased.

C. Decreased proteolysis: Proteolysis (protein breakdown) is increased in diabetes, not decreased, as the body breaks down muscle tissue to provide energy.

D. Increased lipoprotein lipase activity: Lipoprotein lipase is an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides in lipoproteins. Its activity is not directly related to glucose metabolism or DKA.

E. Decreased glucose uptake by brain cells: While the brain is sensitive to glucose levels, decreased glucose uptake by brain cells is not a direct consequence of insulin deficiency or DKA.

In summary, the correct answer is A. Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes, which is a key feature of diabetes mellitus and DKA.",Success
"A 58-year-old woman presents to the emergency department because of worsening abdominal pain for the past 2 days. She reports nausea and vomiting and is unable to tolerate oral intake. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), the pulse is 92/min, the respirations are 18/min, and the blood pressure is 132/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows yellowish discoloration of her sclera. Her abdomen is tender in the right upper quadrant. There is no abdominal distention or organomegaly. The laboratory tests show the following results:
Hemoglobin 13 g/dL
Leukocyte count 16,000/mm3
Urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL
Creatinine 2 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase 432 U/L
Alanine aminotransferase 196 U/L
Aspartate transaminase 207 U/L
Bilirubin  
Total 3.8 mg/dL
Direct 2.7 mg/dL
Lipase 82 U/L
Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant shows dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder. The pancreas is not well visualized. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and metronidazole are initiated. After 12 hours, the patient appears acutely ill and is not oriented to time. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), the pulse is 105/min, the respirations are 22/min, and the blood pressure is 112/82 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

The patient presents with symptoms and laboratory results consistent with acute cholangitis, a life-threatening condition that requires prompt intervention. The ultrasound findings of dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and gallstones (hyperechoic spheres) support this diagnosis. The patient's worsening clinical status, including fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status, indicate a high risk of sepsis and mortality if not treated urgently.

ERCP is the most appropriate next step in management because it allows for both diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. ERCP can confirm the diagnosis of cholangitis, identify the level of biliary obstruction, and provide therapeutic relief by performing a sphincterotomy and stone extraction or stent placement to drain the infected bile. This can help to improve the patient's clinical status and reduce the risk of sepsis and mortality.

While abdominal CT scan (Option A) may provide additional information about the pancreas and other abdominal structures, it is not a therapeutic intervention and would not address the patient's acute biliary obstruction.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Option C) is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient's primary problem is acute cholangitis, not gallstone disease. Furthermore, the patient's unstable condition makes her a poor candidate for surgery.

MRCP (Option D) is a diagnostic test that may provide additional information about the biliary tree, but it would not provide therapeutic relief and would delay definitive treatment.

Percutaneous cholecystostomy (Option E) may be considered in patients with acute cholecystitis, but it is not the best option for this patient with acute cholangitis, as it would not address the underlying biliary obstruction.

In summary, ERCP is the most appropriate next step in management, as it offers both diagnostic and therapeutic benefits and can provide urgent relief from the patient's life-threatening biliary obstruction.",Success
"A 62-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor with continued hypertension despite adherence to multiple anti-hypertensive medications. The physician suspects that the patient may have elevated aldosterone levels and wants to initiate a trial of an aldosterone receptor antagonist. The patient is very concerned about side effects, particularly impotence and gynecomastia, as he had a friend who took a similar medication and had these side-effects. Which of the following is the best medication to initiate, given his concerns and the physician's diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Eplerenone.

The patient is concerned about impotence and gynecomastia, which are known side effects of spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic and aldosterone receptor antagonist. Spironolactone can cause anti-androgenic effects, leading to gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction, and decreased libido.

Eplerenone, on the other hand, is a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist that is less likely to cause these side effects. It has a more specific mechanism of action, binding only to the mineralocorticoid receptor, whereas spironolactone binds to both mineralocorticoid and androgen receptors. This selectivity reduces the risk of anti-androgenic side effects.

Amiloride and triamterene are also potassium-sparing diuretics, but they do not have aldosterone receptor antagonist properties. Ethacrynic acid is a loop diuretic, which is not an aldosterone receptor antagonist.

The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommend the use of eplerenone as an add-on therapy for resistant hypertension, particularly in patients with primary aldosteronism or aldosterone-producing adenoma.

In summary, given the patient's concerns about impotence and gynecomastia, eplerenone is the best medication to initiate, as it is a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist with a lower risk of anti-androgenic side effects.",Success
"A 30-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a recent episode of chest pain. She says she was previously well and denies any history of similar symptoms. She reports that, at onset, she felt as if she was going to die and says her heart beating has been beating really fast. There was also profuse sweating, and she says she feels short of breath. She could not recall how long the event lasted but can remember that the symptoms did go away on their own by the time she arrived at the emergency department. Her vitals rapidly returned to normal while giving her medical history and she begins to look and act more calm. No significant past medical history or current medications.  Physical examination is unremarkable. Her electrocardiogram and initial cardiac enzymes are normal. Which the following is necessary to confirm the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is B. Average of 1 disruptive event per week.

Based on the patient's symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is a panic attack, which is a common manifestation of panic disorder. The patient's symptoms, such as chest pain, rapid heartbeat, profuse sweating, and shortness of breath, are consistent with a panic attack. The fact that her symptoms resolved on their own and her vitals returned to normal also supports this diagnosis.

To confirm the diagnosis of panic disorder, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria require that the patient experiences recurrent unexpected panic attacks, which are defined as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and includes at least four of the following symptoms:

* Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate
* Sweating
* Trembling or shaking
* Shortness of breath or feeling of choking
* Nausea or abdominal distress
* Feeling of impending doom or death

The DSM-5 also requires that the patient experiences an average of at least one panic attack per week for at least one month. This is why option B is the correct answer.

Option A is incorrect because the patient does not need to experience symptoms for a full month to meet the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder. Option C is also incorrect because the duration of the panic attack is not a diagnostic criterion. Option D, family history, may be relevant in assessing the patient's risk for panic disorder, but it is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Option E, agoraphobia, is a common complication of panic disorder, but it is not a diagnostic criterion for panic disorder itself.",Success
"A previously healthy 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation because of loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme irritability for the past 3 weeks. He was recently kicked off of the school's football team after missing too many practices. He has also been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them, but he admits that he is lonely. He has not left his room for 2 days, which prompted his father to bring him to the physician. He has no medical conditions and does not take any medications. He does not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. While the father is in the waiting room, a mental status examination is conducted, which shows a constricted affect. Cognition is intact. He says that he would be better off dead and refuses to be treated. He says he wants to use his father's licensed firearm to “end his misery” over the weekend when his parents are at church. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents.

This patient is exhibiting symptoms of depression, including loss of appetite, sleeplessness, irritability, social withdrawal, and feelings of loneliness. The mental status examination reveals a constricted affect, which is consistent with depression. Most concerning, however, is the patient's statement about wanting to use his father's licensed firearm to ""end his misery,"" which indicates suicidal ideation.

Given the patient's suicidal thoughts and refusal to be treated, involuntary hospitalization is the most appropriate next step in management. This is because the patient poses an imminent risk to himself, and hospitalization will provide a safe environment for him to receive immediate treatment and crisis intervention.

The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) recommends that adolescents with suicidal ideation or behavior be hospitalized to ensure their safety and provide intensive treatment.

The other options are not appropriate:

A. Agreeing to the patient's wish for no further treatment would be unethical and potentially harmful, as it would allow the patient to continue to pose a risk to himself.

B. Beginning paroxetine therapy is not appropriate at this time, as the patient's suicidal ideation takes priority over pharmacological treatment.

D. Reassuring the patient that he will feel better is insufficient and dismissive of his current distress and suicidal thoughts.

E. Starting outpatient psychotherapy is not sufficient to address the patient's immediate risk of suicide and would not provide the necessary level of care and supervision.

Involuntary hospitalization, followed by a comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan, is the most appropriate course of action to ensure the patient's safety and well-being.",Success
"A previously healthy 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of generalized malaise and a palpable swelling in the left axilla. The parents report that 2 weeks ago, his daycare group visited an animal shelter, after which he developed a rash on the left hand. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F). Physical examination shows three linear crusts on an erythematous background on the dorsum of the left hand. There is tender left-sided axillary and cervical lymphadenopathy. Histopathologic examination of an axillary lymph node shows necrotizing granulomas. The most likely causal organism of this patient's clinical findings is also involved in the pathogenesis of which of the following conditions?",A,"The correct answer is A. Bacillary angiomatosis.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including the rash on the left hand, tender axillary and cervical lymphadenopathy, and necrotizing granulomas on histopathologic examination of an axillary lymph node, are consistent with cat-scratch disease (CSD). CSD is caused by Bartonella henselae, a gram-negative bacterium.

Bacillary angiomatosis is a condition characterized by the formation of vascular lesions, typically on the skin, and is also caused by Bartonella henselae. This bacterium is known to cause a range of clinical manifestations, including CSD and bacillary angiomatosis.

The other options are not directly related to the causal organism of the patient's clinical findings:

* Burkitt lymphoma (B) is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and while it can present with lymphadenopathy, it is not related to Bartonella henselae.
* Condylomata lata (C) are genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), which is unrelated to the patient's symptoms and the causal organism of CSD.
* Brucellosis (D) is a zoonotic disease caused by Brucella bacteria, which is not associated with the patient's symptoms or the histopathologic findings.
* Bubonic plague (E) is a zoonotic disease caused by Yersinia pestis, which is not related to the patient's symptoms or the causal organism of CSD.

The right inguinal lymph nodes are enlarged with a spongy consistency and an underlying hard core. The surrounding area is edematous without overlying erythema or cellulitis. A computerized tomography (CT) scan is shown in the picture. Which of the following best explains these findings?",C,"The correct answer is C. Plague.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with bubonic plague, which is caused by Yersinia pestis. The key features that point to this diagnosis are:

1. Severe dyspnea and productive cough with blood-streaked sputum, indicating pneumonia.
2. A history of a pruritic papular rash on the right thigh, which is likely the site of the initial flea bite or inoculation.
3. Painful inguinal swelling (bubo) on the same side as the rash, which is a characteristic feature of bubonic plague.
4. Enlarged right inguinal lymph nodes with a spongy consistency and an underlying hard core, which is consistent with a bubo.
5. The patient's confusion, fever, and hypotension suggest sepsis, which is a common complication of plague.
6. The CT scan shows bilateral lung infiltrates, which is consistent with pneumonic plague.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

A. Lyme disease: While Lyme disease can cause a rash, it is typically a circular, expanding rash (erythema migrans) rather than a pruritic papular rash. Additionally, Lyme disease is not typically associated with pneumonia or sepsis.

B. Malaria: Malaria can cause fever, chills, and respiratory symptoms, but it is not typically associated with a rash, painful lymphadenopathy, or pneumonia.

D. Tick typhus: Tick typhus can cause a rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy, but it is not typically associated with pneumonia or sepsis.

E. Legionnaire's disease: Legionnaire's disease can cause pneumonia, fever, and confusion, but it is not typically associated with a rash, painful lymphadenopathy, or a history of a flea bite.

There is a non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy present. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Molluscum contagiosum.

Here's why:

* The patient presents with small, dome-shaped, hardened papules on his left thigh, which is consistent with the characteristic appearance of molluscum contagiosum lesions.
* The central umbilication observed in each papule is a hallmark feature of molluscum contagiosum.
* The patient's history of intravenous drug use and smoking increases his risk of contracting molluscum contagiosum, which is a viral infection that can be spread through skin-to-skin contact or contaminated fomites.
* The patient's symptoms of fatigue and malaise are non-specific and do not point to a specific diagnosis, but they do not contradict the diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum.
* The presence of non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy is also consistent with molluscum contagiosum, as the virus can cause regional lymphadenopathy.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

* A. Kaposi sarcoma is a malignant tumor that typically presents with purple or red patches or plaques, not dome-shaped papules. While the patient's history of intravenous drug use increases his risk of HIV infection, which is a risk factor for Kaposi sarcoma, the lesions described are not consistent with this diagnosis.
* B. Bed bug bites typically present as itchy, flat or raised lesions, not hardened papules with central umbilication.
* D. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin condition characterized by dry, itchy skin and eczematous lesions, which do not match the patient's presentation.
* E. Acute urticaria is a skin condition characterized by itchy, raised wheals or hives, which do not match the patient's presentation.

"A prominent male politician has secret homosexual desires. However, rather than engaging in homosexual behavior, he holds rallies against gay rights and regularly criticizes gay people. The politician is displaying which of the following defense mechanisms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Reaction formation.

Reaction formation is a defense mechanism in which an individual adopts behaviors or attitudes that are opposite of their unconscious desires or impulses. In this case, the politician has secret homosexual desires, but instead of acting on them, he actively campaigns against gay rights and criticizes gay people. This behavior is a classic example of reaction formation, as he is attempting to conceal his true desires by taking a strong stance against them.

Repression (A) involves pushing uncomfortable thoughts or desires out of conscious awareness, but the politician is not simply repressing his desires; he is actively taking actions to counter them.

Denial (C) involves refusing to acknowledge an uncomfortable reality, but the politician is not denying his desires; he is trying to compensate for them by taking a contradictory stance.

Displacement (D) involves redirecting emotions or impulses from the original source to a more acceptable target, but the politician's behavior is not a redirection of his desires; it is a direct attempt to counter them.

Sublimation (E) involves channeling unacceptable impulses into a more acceptable behavior, but the politician's behavior is not a constructive or positive outlet for his desires; it is a negative and harmful reaction against them.

His temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 167/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient’s physical exam is unremarkable. His laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Hemoglobin: 12 g/dL
Hematocrit: 36%
Leukocyte count: 7,550/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 197,000/mm^3

Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best explanation for this patient’s laboratory values?",A,"The correct answer is E. Medication noncompliance.

The patient's laboratory values suggest that the warfarin therapy is not effective, as the INR (International Normalized Ratio) is 1.0, which is below the therapeutic range for atrial fibrillation (typically 2.0-3.0). Warfarin is a blood thinner that works by inhibiting the production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors in the liver, and its effectiveness is monitored by the INR.

The patient's recent switch to an all-vegetarian diet (option A) is unlikely to affect the INR value. Vegetarian diets are often low in vitamin K, which could potentially increase the effectiveness of warfarin, but this would result in an elevated INR, not a decreased one.

Increased hepatic metabolism (option B) could potentially decrease the effectiveness of warfarin, but this would not be a likely explanation for a subtherapeutic INR in this patient.

Increased renal clearance (option C) is also unlikely to affect the INR value, as warfarin is primarily metabolized by the liver and excreted through the bile, rather than being cleared by the kidneys.

Laboratory error (option D) is always a possibility, but it is less likely than medication noncompliance in this scenario, given the patient's complex medical history and the importance of warfarin therapy in preventing stroke in atrial fibrillation.

Medication noncompliance (option E) is the most plausible explanation for the subtherapeutic INR. The patient may not be taking their warfarin as directed, which could result in a decreased INR and increased risk of stroke. The healthcare provider should investigate this possibility and counsel the patient on the importance of adherence to their medication regimen.",Success
"A 20-year-old woman in the army recruit collapses during an especially hot day at basic training. She was in her normal excellent state of health prior to this event.

Catheterization produces 200 mL of tea-colored urine. Urine dipstick is positive for blood, but urinalysis is negative for RBCs or WBCs. Which of the following is most likely responsible for her condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Heat stroke.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with heat stroke, a life-threatening medical emergency. The key features that support this diagnosis are:

1. Elevated body temperature (40.3°C or 104.5°F): This is a hallmark of heat stroke.
2. Altered mental status: The patient's collapse and altered mental status are indicative of heat stroke, which can cause central nervous system dysfunction.
3. Dry, hot, and erythematous skin: This suggests dehydration and heat-related illness.
4. Severe bilateral flank pain and generalized myalgia: These symptoms are common in heat stroke, likely due to muscle damage and rhabdomyolysis.
5. Tea-colored urine: This is a sign of myoglobinuria, which occurs when muscle breakdown products (myoglobin) are released into the urine.
6. Urine dipstick positive for blood, but urinalysis negative for RBCs or WBCs: This suggests the presence of myoglobin, which can cause a positive blood test on the urine dipstick, but not actual red blood cells.

Heat stroke is a more likely explanation than heat exhaustion (option C), as the patient's altered mental status and severe symptoms are more consistent with the former.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings:

A. A mutation of the COL4A5 gene is associated with Alport syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, ears, and eyes. While the patient's father has CKD, bilateral hearing loss, and vision problems, there is no evidence to suggest the patient has Alport syndrome.

B. Neisseria meningitides is a bacterium that causes meningitis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

E. IgA nephropathy is a kidney disorder that can cause hematuria (blood in the urine), but it is not typically associated with the patient's symptoms, such as altered mental status, severe flank pain, and myalgia.

Which of the following signs is a direct result of hyperestrinism in cirrhotic patients?",B,"The correct answer is B. Gynecomastia.

Hyperestrinism, or elevated estrogen levels, is a common finding in cirrhotic patients, particularly those with advanced liver disease. This is due to the liver's inability to metabolize and clear estrogen, leading to its accumulation in the body.

Gynecomastia, or breast tissue enlargement in males, is a direct result of hyperestrinism. Estrogen stimulates the growth of breast tissue, leading to the development of gynecomastia.

The other options are not directly related to hyperestrinism:

A. Coagulopathy is a consequence of liver dysfunction and decreased production of clotting factors.

C. Jaundice is a result of bilirubin accumulation in the blood due to liver dysfunction.

D. Lower limb swelling (edema) is often seen in cirrhotic patients due to portal hypertension, sodium retention, and hypoalbuminemia.

E. Caput medusae refers to the dilated veins around the umbilicus, which are a sign of portal hypertension and collateral circulation.

"A 47-year-old woman seeks evaluation at your office because she has had postcoital vaginal bleeding for the past 8 months with occasional intermenstrual watery, blood-tinged vaginal discharge. Her family history is negative for malignancies and inherited disorders. She is the result of a pregnancy complicated by numerous miscarriages in the 1960s, for which her mother received diethylstilbestrol. During a pelvic examination, you notice a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina. The bimanual examination is negative for adnexal masses. You suspect the presence of carcinoma and, therefore, send tissue samples to pathology, which confirmed the presence of malignant cells. Which of the following is the most likely malignant tumor in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Clear cell adenocarcinoma.

The patient's history of diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure in utero is a significant risk factor for clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina. DES is a synthetic estrogen that was prescribed to pregnant women from the 1940s to the 1970s to prevent miscarriage and premature birth. However, it was later found to increase the risk of vaginal and cervical abnormalities in the offspring, including clear cell adenocarcinoma.

The patient's symptoms, including postcoital bleeding and intermenstrual discharge, are consistent with a vaginal malignancy. The presence of a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina further supports this diagnosis. The pathology report confirming the presence of malignant cells solidifies the diagnosis of a malignant tumor.

Clear cell adenocarcinoma is a rare type of vaginal cancer that typically affects women who were exposed to DES in utero. It is more common in women under the age of 50 and often presents with abnormal vaginal bleeding, discharge, or a palpable mass.

The other options are less likely:

B. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can occur in the vagina, but it is less common than clear cell adenocarcinoma in this patient population.

C. Botryoid sarcoma is a rare type of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma that typically affects children and young adults, not women in their 40s.

D. Verrucous carcinoma is a type of squamous cell carcinoma that can occur in the vagina, but it is less common than clear cell adenocarcinoma in this patient population.

E. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common type of vaginal cancer, but it is less likely in this patient given her history of DES exposure and the presence of a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina.

In summary, the patient's history of DES exposure, symptoms, and pathology report make clear cell adenocarcinoma the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 35-year-old man visits your office for his annual health checkup. He was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder 6 months ago, which is being treated with citalopram. He comments that his symptoms have improved since initiating the prescribed therapy; however, in the past 2 months, he has been unable to have sexual intercourse due to weak tumescence and low libido. His blood pressure is 122/74 mm Hg, heart rate is 75/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. What is the appropriate step in the management of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is B. Addition of bupropion.

Here's why:

The patient is experiencing sexual dysfunction, specifically weak tumescence and low libido, as a side effect of taking citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to treat generalized anxiety disorder. SSRIs are known to cause sexual dysfunction in up to 70% of patients.

Bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, is an antidepressant that has been shown to have a lower incidence of sexual dysfunction compared to SSRIs. Adding bupropion to the patient's regimen may help alleviate the sexual side effects while still managing his anxiety disorder.

Lowering the dose of citalopram (Option A) may not be effective in resolving the sexual dysfunction and may compromise the patient's anxiety treatment.

Switching to fluoxetine (Option C) is not a good option, as it is another SSRI that may also cause sexual dysfunction.

Adding sildenafil (Option D) may help with erectile dysfunction, but it does not address the underlying cause of the sexual dysfunction, which is likely related to the SSRI.

Switching to selegiline (Option E) is not a good option, as it is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that has its own set of side effects and interactions, and may not be effective in managing the patient's anxiety disorder.

It's essential to note that before making any changes to the patient's medication regimen, a thorough discussion with the patient about the potential benefits and risks of each option should take place.",Success
"A 63-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of an unintentional 10-kg (22-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. During this period, the patient has had recurrent episodes of high-grade fever, night sweats, and feelings of fatigue. Two months ago, he had herpes zoster that was treated with acyclovir. He appears pale. Temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows generalized painless lymphadenopathy. The liver and the spleen are palpated 2–3 cm below the right and the left costal margin, respectively. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 42%
Leukocyte count 15,000/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 46%
Eosinophils 1%
Lymphocytes 50%
Monocytes 3%
Platelet count 120,000/mm3
Blood smear shows mature lymphocytes that rupture easily and appear as artifacts on a blood smear. Flow cytometry shows lymphocytes expressing CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?""",C,"The correct answer is C. Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). The presence of recurrent fever, night sweats, and fatigue, along with the physical examination findings of generalized painless lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, suggest a lymphoproliferative disorder. The laboratory results, including the complete blood count (CBC) and flow cytometry, confirm the diagnosis of CLL.

The flow cytometry results showing lymphocytes expressing CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23 are characteristic of CLL. The presence of mature lymphocytes that rupture easily and appear as artifacts on a blood smear is also consistent with CLL.

The treatment of CLL depends on the stage and risk category of the disease. Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, it appears that the patient has advanced-stage CLL that requires treatment.

The most appropriate treatment for this patient would be a combination chemotherapy regimen, such as fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). This regimen is a commonly used and effective treatment for CLL, particularly for patients with advanced-stage disease.

Option A, chlorambucil only, is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient, as it is typically used for patients with early-stage CLL who do not have significant symptoms.

Option B, all-trans retinoic acid, is not typically used to treat CLL.

Option D, observation and disease progression monitoring, is not appropriate for this patient, as they have significant symptoms and laboratory evidence of advanced-stage disease.

Option E, imatinib only, is not effective for treating CLL, as it is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor primarily used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab.",Success
"A 61-year-old man is brought to the emergency room with chest pain. He developed severe, crushing, substernal chest pain 10 hours ago while he was hiking in the Adirondack mountains. He was with 2 friends at the time who gave him aspirin before carrying him 5 miles to a town to get phone service, where they then called emergency medical services. His past medical history is notable for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He takes enalapril, metformin, and atorvastatin. He has a 20-pack-year smoking history and is an avid hiker. His temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 102/60 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 28/min. He is diaphoretic and intermittently conscious. Bilateral rales are heard on pulmonary auscultation. An electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in leads I and aVL. Despite appropriate management, the patient expires. An autopsy is performed demonstrating ischemia in the left atrium and posterior left ventricle. Which of the following vessels was most likely affected in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Left circumflex artery.

Here's why:

The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST elevations in leads I and aVL, which is consistent with a lateral wall myocardial infarction (MI). The autopsy findings of ischemia in the left atrium and posterior left ventricle further support this diagnosis.

The left circumflex artery (LCx) is the most likely culprit vessel in this case. The LCx supplies the lateral wall of the left ventricle, including the posterior segment. Occlusion of the LCx would result in ischemia to this region, consistent with the autopsy findings.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Left anterior descending artery (LAD): The LAD supplies the anterior wall of the left ventricle, not the lateral or posterior walls. ST elevations in leads I and aVL are not typical of an LAD occlusion.

C. Left coronary artery: The left coronary artery is the main trunk that bifurcates into the LAD and LCx. While an occlusion of the left coronary artery could affect both the LAD and LCx, the ECG findings and autopsy results are more consistent with an isolated LCx occlusion.

D. Posterior descending artery: The posterior descending artery is a branch of the right coronary artery (RCA) that supplies the posterior wall of the left ventricle. While it's possible that the RCA could be involved, the ECG findings and autopsy results are more consistent with an LCx occlusion.

E. Right marginal artery: The right marginal artery is a branch of the RCA that supplies the right ventricle, not the left ventricle. It's unlikely to be involved in this case.

In summary, the patient's ECG and autopsy findings are consistent with a lateral wall MI, making the left circumflex artery the most likely affected vessel.",Success
"A 61-year-old man comes to the physician with several months of sharp, shooting pain in both legs. Twenty years ago, he had a painless ulcer on his penis that resolved without treatment. He has no history of serious illness. Examination shows small pupils that constrict with accommodation but do not react to light. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the distal lower extremities. Patellar reflexes are absent bilaterally. His gait is unsteady and broad-based. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications?",E,"The correct answer is A. Atrioventricular block.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with tertiary syphilis, specifically tabes dorsalis, a late manifestation of neurosyphilis. The patient's history of a painless ulcer on his penis 20 years ago, which resolved without treatment, suggests untreated primary syphilis.

The examination findings of small pupils that constrict with accommodation but do not react to light (Argyll Robertson pupils), decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch in the distal lower extremities, absent patellar reflexes, and unsteady and broad-based gait are all characteristic of tabes dorsalis.

Tertiary syphilis can also affect the cardiovascular system, leading to complications such as atrioventricular block, which is a conduction abnormality that can cause bradycardia and even heart block. This is due to the inflammation and scarring of the cardiac tissue caused by the syphilitic infection.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:

B. Mitral valve regurgitation is not a typical complication of tertiary syphilis.

C. Penile squamous cell carcinoma is not related to the patient's symptoms or history.

D. Inflammatory polyarthritis is not a typical complication of tertiary syphilis.

E. Thoracic aortic aneurysm can be a complication of syphilis, but it is more commonly associated with the cardiovascular manifestations of tertiary syphilis, such as aortitis, rather than the neurological manifestations described in this patient.",Success
"A 55-year-old woman presents with severe pruritus and fatigue. She denies any similar symptoms in the past. No significant past medical history. Upon physical examination, scleral icterus is present, and significant hepatosplenomegaly is noted. Mild peripheral edema is also present. Laboratory findings are significant for elevated serum levels of bilirubin, aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), immunoglobulins, as well as cholesterol (especially HDL fraction). Antiviral antibodies are not present. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is also elevated. Anti-mitochondrial antibodies are found. A liver biopsy is performed, and the histopathologic examination shows bile duct injury, cholestasis, and granuloma formation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Primary biliary cirrhosis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results are consistent with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). The presence of:

1. Scleral icterus and hepatosplenomegaly suggests liver disease.
2. Elevated bilirubin, aminotransferases, ALP, and GGTP levels indicate cholestasis and liver damage.
3. Elevated immunoglobulins and cholesterol (especially HDL fraction) are characteristic of PBC.
4. The absence of antiviral antibodies rules out viral hepatitis.
5. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggests inflammation.
6. The presence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies is a hallmark of PBC.
7. The liver biopsy findings of bile duct injury, cholestasis, and granuloma formation are consistent with PBC.

Primary biliary cirrhosis is a chronic autoimmune liver disease characterized by the destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis and liver damage.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

B. Hemolytic anemia is unlikely, as there is no mention of anemia or hemolysis in the patient's presentation.

C. Hepatitis A is a viral infection that would have antiviral antibodies present, which is not the case in this patient.

D. Gilbert syndrome is a benign condition characterized by mild, intermittent hyperbilirubinemia, which does not explain the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.

E. Crigler–Najjar syndrome type I is a rare genetic disorder causing severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation and laboratory results.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is primary biliary cirrhosis.",Success
"A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious. He was at a college party exhibiting belligerent behavior when he suddenly passed out and fell to the ground. His past medical history is not known. His temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 107/48 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient is covered with emesis and responds incoherently to questions. As the patient begins to wake up he continues vomiting. The patient is started on IV fluids, analgesics, and anti-emetics and begins to feel better. Thirty minutes later the patient presents with muscle rigidity and is no longer responding coherently to questions. His temperature is 103°F (39.4°C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's basic laboratory studies are drawn and he is started on IV fluids, given lorazepam, and placed under a cooling blanket. Despite these initial measures, his symptoms persist. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Dantrolene.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the development of muscle rigidity, suggest a diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia (MH), a life-threatening medical emergency. MH is often triggered by certain medications, such as succinylcholine, or exposure to volatile anesthetics. In this case, the patient's history of attending a college party and exhibiting belligerent behavior before passing out raises the possibility of substance abuse, which may have contributed to the development of MH.

The patient's initial response to IV fluids, analgesics, and anti-emetics, followed by a deterioration in their condition, is consistent with MH. The elevated temperature, muscle rigidity, and altered mental status are all characteristic features of MH.

Dantrolene is the specific treatment for MH, and it should be administered as soon as possible. Dantrolene works by inhibiting the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which helps to reduce muscle contraction and heat production.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Acetaminophen is not effective in treating MH and may even exacerbate the condition by increasing heat production.

C. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that may help to reduce muscle spasms, but it is not specific to MH and may not address the underlying pathophysiology.

D. Intubation may be necessary to protect the patient's airway, but it is not the primary treatment for MH.

E. Supportive therapy, such as IV fluids and cooling measures, is important, but it is not sufficient to treat MH, and dantrolene should be administered as soon as possible.

It's worth noting that the patient should be monitored closely for signs of MH, such as hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and cardiac arrhythmias, and that prompt treatment with dantrolene can significantly improve outcomes.",Success
A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of pain in his right knee for the past week. The pain is exacerbated by jogging and climbing up stairs. He has no history of trauma to the knee. He is otherwise healthy. He is an active member of his school's gymnastics team. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right knee shows a tender swelling at the proximal tibia; range of motion is full. Knee extension against resistance causes pain in the anterior proximal tibia. The remainder of the examinations shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the right knee shows anterior tibial soft tissue swelling with fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?,A,"The correct answer is A. Administration of oral ketorolac.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including tenderness and swelling at the proximal tibia, pain with knee extension against resistance, and X-ray findings of anterior tibial soft tissue swelling with fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity, are consistent with Osgood-Schlatter disease.

Osgood-Schlatter disease is a common overuse injury affecting the tibial tuberosity, typically seen in active adolescents. The condition is caused by repetitive strain on the patellar tendon, leading to inflammation and fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity.

The most appropriate next step in managing this condition is to provide pain relief and reduce inflammation. Oral ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is a suitable choice for this purpose. NSAIDs are commonly used to treat Osgood-Schlatter disease, as they help reduce pain and inflammation.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

B. Joint aspiration is not necessary, as the diagnosis can be made based on the patient's symptoms and X-ray findings.

C. Open reduction of the tuberosity is not indicated, as Osgood-Schlatter disease is a self-limiting condition that typically resolves with conservative management.

D. Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive medication used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, and cancer. It is not indicated for Osgood-Schlatter disease.

E. Application of a lower leg cast is not necessary, as the condition does not require immobilization. In fact, casting could potentially lead to decreased mobility and strength in the affected leg.

It's essential to note that the patient should also be advised to modify his activities, avoid exacerbating factors, and perform stretching and strengthening exercises to help manage the condition.",Success
"Three days after undergoing an open cholecystectomy, an obese 57-year-old woman has fever, chills, and a headache. She has right-sided chest pain that increases on inspiration and has had a productive cough for the last 12 hours. She had an episode of hypotension after the operation that resolved with intravenous fluid therapy. She underwent an abdominal hysterectomy 16 years ago for multiple fibroids of the uterus. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 17 years. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg. Inspiratory crackles are heard at the right lung base. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There is a healing surgical incision below the right ribcage. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Pneumonia.

Justification:

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, chills, headache, and productive cough, are consistent with a respiratory infection. The presence of inspiratory crackles at the right lung base on physical examination further supports this diagnosis. The patient's recent surgery and episode of hypotension increase her risk for developing pneumonia.

Pneumonia is a common postoperative complication, especially in patients who have undergone abdominal surgery, are obese, and have a history of smoking. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with pneumonia than with the other options.

Option A, Pulmonary embolism, is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. While pulmonary embolism can cause chest pain and shortness of breath, it is not typically associated with fever, chills, and productive cough.

Option B, Subphrenic abscess, is also unlikely. Although the patient has recently undergone abdominal surgery, the symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with an intra-abdominal abscess.

Option D, Atelectasis, is a possible complication of surgery, especially in patients who have undergone abdominal surgery. However, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with pneumonia than with atelectasis.

Option E, Pneumothorax, is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. While pneumothorax can cause chest pain and shortness of breath, it is not typically associated with fever, chills, and productive cough.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, pneumonia is the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 55-year-old man presents with a red rash over his face for the last 3 months. The patient says he moved to Nevada 6 months ago because of a new job where he works outdoors; however, he worked indoors in an office before. His vital signs include: blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, pulse 64/min, respiratory rate 18/min. The patient’s rash is shown in the exhibit. Which of the following is the best initial step in the treatment of this patient?",C,"The correct answer is A. Oral tetracycline.

The patient's rash, as shown in the exhibit, is consistent with rosacea, a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by facial erythema, flushing, and telangiectasia. The patient's recent move to Nevada and outdoor work suggest that he may be experiencing increased sun exposure, which can exacerbate rosacea.

Oral tetracycline is a commonly used antibiotic in the treatment of rosacea, particularly for its anti-inflammatory properties. It is effective in reducing inflammation, erythema, and papulopustular lesions associated with rosacea. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) guidelines recommend oral antibiotics, including tetracycline, as a first-line treatment for moderate to severe rosacea.

Option B, oral clonidine, is not typically used to treat rosacea. Clonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist used to treat hypertension, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and certain pain conditions.

Option C, topical metronidazole, is sometimes used to treat rosacea, but it is not the best initial step. Topical metronidazole is more effective for mild to moderate rosacea, and its efficacy is limited compared to oral antibiotics.

Option D, topical benzoyl peroxide, is not typically used to treat rosacea. Benzoyl peroxide is commonly used to treat acne, not rosacea.

Option E, vascular laser, may be used to treat telangiectasia associated with rosacea, but it is not the best initial step. Laser therapy is usually reserved for more severe cases or for patients who do not respond to pharmacological treatments.

In summary, oral tetracycline is the best initial step in treating this patient's rosacea due to its anti-inflammatory properties and efficacy in reducing symptoms.",Success
"A previously healthy 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain during exercise for the last 6 months. She does not smoke. Her maternal uncle had similar symptoms. Cardiac examination shows wide splitting of S2. The second component of S2 is loud and best heard at the 2nd left intercostal space. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's cardiac findings?",C,"The correct answer is B. Increased left ventricular preload.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain during exercise, suggest a possible cardiac condition. The physical examination finding of wide splitting of S2 (the second heart sound) with a loud second component best heard at the 2nd left intercostal space is consistent with a diagnosis of atrial septal defect (ASD).

In ASD, there is a defect in the septum between the right and left atria, allowing blood to flow from the left atrium to the right atrium. This increases the volume of blood flowing through the right ventricle, which in turn increases the left ventricular preload. The increased preload leads to increased stroke volume and cardiac output, causing the wide splitting of S2.

The loud second component of S2 is due to the delayed closure of the pulmonary valve relative to the aortic valve, which is a characteristic finding in ASD.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Increased right ventricular preload would not cause the specific physical examination findings described.

C. Increased right ventricular afterload would be more consistent with conditions such as pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary stenosis.

D. Increased left ventricular afterload would be more consistent with conditions such as hypertension or aortic stenosis.

E. Increased left-to-right shunting is a general term that could apply to various cardiac conditions, including ASD, but it is not a specific cause of the patient's cardiac findings.

It's worth noting that the patient's family history of a maternal uncle with similar symptoms suggests a possible genetic component to the condition, which is consistent with ASD being a congenital heart defect.",Success
An 11-year-old boy presents to your office with pitting edema and proteinuria exceeding 3.5g in 24 hours. You suspect that this patient has experienced a loss of polyanions in his glomerular basement membranes. Which of the following findings would confirm your diagnosis?,C,"The correct answer is C. Selective albuminuria.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, pitting edema and proteinuria exceeding 3.5g in 24 hours, suggest a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. The loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membrane is a characteristic feature of minimal change disease, a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children.

Selective albuminuria is a hallmark of minimal change disease. In this condition, the glomerular basement membrane loses its negative charge, allowing albumin to pass through the glomerulus and into the urine. The term ""selective"" refers to the fact that albumin is preferentially lost in the urine, while larger proteins are retained.

The other options are not consistent with minimal change disease or nephrotic syndrome:

A. WBC casts in the urine are more indicative of a urinary tract infection or interstitial nephritis.

B. RBC casts in the urine suggest glomerulonephritis or vasculitis.

D. Negatively birefringent crystals in the urine are characteristic of uric acid nephropathy or gout.

E. Bence-Jones proteinuria is a feature of multiple myeloma, a malignancy of plasma cells.

An MRI of the head and neck is shown. This patient's condition is most likely the result of nerve root compression by a structure derived from which of the following embryologic layers?",C,"The correct answer is B. Neural crest.

The patient's symptoms, including neck and arm pain, tingling sensation in the hand, and weakness in wrist extension, are consistent with a diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy, specifically compression of the C6 or C7 nerve root. The MRI image shows a herniated disk in the cervical spine, which is compressing the nerve root.

The neural crest is an embryologic layer that gives rise to various structures, including the meninges, Schwann cells, and the vertebral column, including the intervertebral discs. The herniated disc in this patient's MRI is derived from the neural crest.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Endoderm: This embryologic layer gives rise to the lining of the gut, respiratory, and genitourinary tracts, as well as the thyroid and adrenal glands. It is not related to the development of the vertebral column or intervertebral discs.

C. Notochord: This is a transient embryologic structure that forms the basis of the vertebral column, but it is not directly related to the development of intervertebral discs.

D. Neural tube: This embryologic structure gives rise to the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. While it is related to the development of the nervous system, it is not directly related to the development of intervertebral discs.

E. Surface ectoderm: This embryologic layer gives rise to the skin, hair, nails, and sensory organs, as well as the epithelial lining of the mouth and anus. It is not related to the development of the vertebral column or intervertebral discs.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Neural crest.",Success
"A 32-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her friend for acute onset abdominal pain.

The patient’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 110/68 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On physical exam, there is left-sided, lower abdominal tenderness and guarding. Pelvic examination is notable for clear mucous in the vaginal introitus and tenderness of the left adnexa. A pelvic ultrasound with Doppler reveals a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is C. Ovarian torsion.

Here's why:

* The patient's sudden onset of left-sided abdominal pain, especially after physical activity, is consistent with ovarian torsion.
* The physical exam findings of left-sided, lower abdominal tenderness and guarding support this diagnosis.
* The presence of clear mucous in the vaginal introitus and tenderness of the left adnexa on pelvic examination also point towards ovarian torsion.
* The pelvic ultrasound with Doppler showing a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch (also known as the pouch of Douglas) is consistent with ovarian torsion, as it can cause fluid accumulation in this area.

While the other options are possible, they are less likely based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings:

* A. Ectopic pregnancy is possible, but the patient's regular menstrual periods and lack of vaginal bleeding make it less likely. Additionally, the ultrasound findings are not consistent with an ectopic pregnancy.
* B. Mittelschmerz is a benign condition that occurs mid-cycle, but the patient's symptoms are more severe and persistent than typical mittelschmerz.
* D. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a possibility, but the patient's lack of fever, normal blood pressure, and absence of cervical motion tenderness make it less likely. Additionally, PID would not typically cause the ultrasound findings seen in this patient.
* E. Ruptured ovarian cyst is possible, but the patient's symptoms and examination findings are more consistent with ovarian torsion. A ruptured ovarian cyst would typically cause more diffuse abdominal pain and may not have the same ultrasound findings.

It's worth noting that ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent ovarian necrosis and infertility.",Success
"A 63-year-old man from the countryside presents with leg swelling and right upper abdominal tenderness. He reports a history of myocardial infarction 4 years ago, but he has no supporting documentation. At the moment, his only medication is aspirin. He also stated that he used to have ‘high blood sugars’ when checked in the hospital 4 years ago, but he did not follow up regarding this issue. He works as a farmer and noticed that it became much harder for him to work in the last few days because of fatigue and syncope. He has a 24-pack-year history of smoking and consumes alcohol occasionally. The vital signs include: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). On physical examination, the patient is pale and acrocyanotic. There is a visible jugular vein distention and bilateral lower leg pitting edema. The pulmonary auscultation is significant for occasional bilateral wheezes. Cardiac auscultation is significant for a decreased S1, S3 gallop, and grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border in the 4th left intercostal space. Abdominal percussion and palpation are suggestive of ascites. The hepatic margin is 3 cm below the right costal margin. Hepatojugular reflux is positive. Which of the following is the most likely clinical finding observed in this patient on an echocardiogram?",B,"The correct answer is B. Increased peak tricuspid regurgitation.

Justification:

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is heart failure with right ventricular failure. The patient presents with leg swelling, right upper abdominal tenderness, and ascites, which are indicative of right-sided heart failure. The jugular vein distention, bilateral lower leg pitting edema, and positive hepatojugular reflux further support this diagnosis.

The echocardiogram finding that would be most consistent with this diagnosis is increased peak tricuspid regurgitation (Option B). Tricuspid regurgitation is a common finding in right ventricular failure, and an increased peak velocity would suggest increased pressure in the right ventricle.

Option A, left ventricular ejection fraction of 41%, may be present in this patient, but it is not the most specific finding for right ventricular failure.

Option C, hypokinetic wall of the left ventricle, is not directly related to right ventricular failure, and the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest left ventricular dysfunction.

Option D, abnormal left ventricular relaxation, is also not directly related to right ventricular failure, and the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest diastolic dysfunction.

Option E, decreased right atrial pressure, is unlikely in a patient with right ventricular failure, as the right atrial pressure would be expected to be elevated due to the increased pressure in the right ventricle.

Therefore, the most likely clinical finding observed on an echocardiogram in this patient is increased peak tricuspid regurgitation (Option B).",Success

The patient's symptoms are consistent with Hoarding Disorder, a psychiatric condition characterized by difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value, leading to cluttered living spaces and significant distress or impairment. The patient's anxiety when trying to discard items, feelings of frustration, and lack of improvement with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) suggest that medication may be necessary.

Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is a commonly used medication for Hoarding Disorder. Studies have shown that SSRIs, particularly fluoxetine, can be effective in reducing symptoms of hoarding, including clutter, difficulty discarding, and anxiety. The American Psychiatric Association's Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients with Hoarding Disorder recommends considering medication, specifically SSRIs, as an adjunct to CBT for patients who do not respond to therapy alone.

The other options are not supported by evidence for the treatment of Hoarding Disorder:

A. Atomoxetine is a non-stimulant medication primarily used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

C. Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant medication used to treat bipolar disorder and epilepsy.

D. Buspirone is an anxiolytic medication used to treat anxiety disorders, but it has not been specifically studied for Hoarding Disorder.

E. Methylphenidate is a stimulant medication used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy, but it is not indicated for Hoarding Disorder.

In summary, fluoxetine is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient with Hoarding Disorder, as it has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of hoarding and is recommended by the American Psychiatric Association's practice guidelines.",Success
"A 59-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider complaining of diffuse bodily aches. She reports a 3-month history of gradually worsening pain in her shoulders and hips that is worse in her right hip. She has a history of hypertension and recurrent renal stones for which she takes lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. She was admitted to the hospital earlier in the year after falling in her front yard and sustaining a distal radius fracture and vertebral compression fracture. Her temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 20/min. On exam, she is well-appearing with mild tenderness to palpation in her shoulders and hips. She has mild pain with hip flexion and shoulder abduction. She has full range of motion in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Serum findings are notable for the following:

Serum:
Na+: 141 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.8 mEq/L
HCO3-: 22 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen: 17 mg/dL
Glucose: 110 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.12 mg/dL
Ca2+: 11.2 mg/dL
Phosphate: 2.3 mg/dL
Mg2+: 1.9 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase: 120 U/L

A radiograph of this patient’s right hip would most likely reveal which of the following?",E,"The correct answer is B. Irregular blastic lesion.

The patient's symptoms, medical history, and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of Paget's disease of bone. The gradual onset of pain in her shoulders and hips, particularly the right hip, is consistent with this condition. The laboratory results show an elevated alkaline phosphatase level, which is a hallmark of Paget's disease.

Radiographically, Paget's disease typically appears as an irregular blastic lesion, characterized by a mixture of bone resorption and formation. This can result in a disorganized, irregular bone architecture.

Option A is more consistent with a benign bone tumor, such as an aneurysmal bone cyst.

Option C is more consistent with an aggressive bone lesion, such as osteosarcoma or Ewing's sarcoma.

Option D is more consistent with a malignant bone tumor, such as a metastasis or a primary bone sarcoma.

Option E is more consistent with a benign bone lesion, such as a unicameral bone cyst.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of vertebral compression fracture and distal radius fracture may be related to Paget's disease, which can increase the risk of fractures due to weakened bone structure.",Success
"A 20-year-old woman is brought in for a psychiatric consultation by her mother who is concerned because of her daughter’s recent bizarre behavior. The patient’s father died from lung cancer 1 week ago. Though this has been stressful for the whole family, the daughter has been hearing voices and having intrusive thoughts ever since. These voices have conversations about her and how she should have been the one to die and they encourage her to kill herself. She has not been able to concentrate at work or at school. She has no other history of medical or psychiatric illness. She denies recent use of any medication. Today, her heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, and temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F). On physical exam, she appears gaunt and anxious. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. CMP, CBC, and TSH are normal. A urine toxicology test is negative. What is the patient’s most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Brief psychotic disorder.

Here's why:

The patient is experiencing acute symptoms of psychosis, including hearing voices and having intrusive thoughts, which are distressing and impairing her daily life. These symptoms started suddenly after a significant stressor, the death of her father, and have lasted for less than a month (1 week, to be exact). This acute onset and short duration of symptoms are consistent with brief psychotic disorder.

Brief psychotic disorder is a DSM-5 diagnosis characterized by the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech or behavior, that last for at least 1 day but less than 1 month. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder, such as schizophrenia, and are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition.

Option B, Schizophreniform disorder, is a possibility, but it requires symptoms to last for at least 1 month but less than 6 months. Since the patient's symptoms have only lasted for 1 week, this diagnosis is not yet met.

Option C, Adjustment disorder, is not a good fit because it typically involves emotional or behavioral symptoms, such as anxiety or depression, in response to a stressor, but it does not typically involve psychotic symptoms.

Option D, Schizophrenia, is a chronic and persistent mental disorder that involves a longer duration of symptoms, typically more than 6 months.

Option E, Bereavement, is a normal response to the loss of a loved one and does not typically involve psychotic symptoms.

The patient's normal physical exam, laboratory results, and urine toxicology test rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to her symptoms.",Success
"A 58-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with difficulty breathing and a sensation that her heart was racing for the past 3 days. She adds that she has lost weight over the last 7 weeks, despite a good appetite, and is anxious most of the time with difficulty sleeping at night. She has smoked 10 cigarettes per day for the past 15 years. Her blood pressure is 100/55 mmHg, temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), and pulse is irregular with a rate of 140–150/min. On physical examination she is thin, frail, and appears anxious. Her palms are sweaty and there are fine tremors on extension of both hands. She has a palpable smooth thyroid mass. Examination of the eyes reveals bilateral exophthalmos. An electrocardiogram is obtained and shown in the picture. Which of the following has a strong positive correlation with this patient’s heart rhythm?",D,"The correct answer is D. Age.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) shown in the picture is consistent with atrial fibrillation (AFib), which is a type of irregular heartbeat. The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and ECG results are all consistent with hyperthyroidism, specifically Graves' disease.

Atrial fibrillation is a common complication of hyperthyroidism, and its prevalence increases with age. Studies have shown that the risk of developing AFib increases with advancing age, particularly after the age of 60. Therefore, age has a strong positive correlation with the patient's heart rhythm.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Digoxin blood level: While digoxin is a medication used to treat AFib, there is no correlation between digoxin blood levels and the patient's heart rhythm in this scenario.

B. PR interval: The PR interval is a measure of the time between the start of the P wave and the start of the QRS complex on an ECG. It is not directly related to the patient's heart rhythm in this case.

C. QT interval: The QT interval is a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave on an ECG. While QT interval prolongation can be associated with certain medications and electrolyte imbalances, it is not directly related to the patient's heart rhythm in this scenario.

E. Amiodarone blood level: Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication that can be used to treat AFib. However, there is no correlation between amiodarone blood levels and the patient's heart rhythm in this scenario.

In summary, the patient's age has a strong positive correlation with her heart rhythm, which is consistent with atrial fibrillation secondary to hyperthyroidism.",Success
A 27-year-old male suddenly develops severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea. The patient reports consuming undercooked ground beef four days prior to the onset of the symptoms. Which of the following best describes the toxin-mediated mechanism of this disease process?,E,"The correct answer is A. Depolymerization of actin filaments in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, leading to mucosal cell death.

The patient's symptoms, including severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea, are consistent with a diagnosis of hemorrhagic colitis caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), specifically E. coli O157:H7. This bacterium is commonly found in undercooked ground beef.

Shiga toxin, also known as verotoxin, is a potent exotoxin produced by STEC. It works by inhibiting protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, leading to cell death and tissue damage. Specifically, Shiga toxin depolymerizes actin filaments in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, causing cell rounding, detachment, and eventually, cell death. This leads to the characteristic bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramping seen in hemorrhagic colitis.

The other options are not directly related to the mechanism of Shiga toxin:

B. Increased pH of gastrointestinal lumen resulting in reduced mucosal absorption: This is not a mechanism of Shiga toxin.

C. Increased intracellular cAMP in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, resulting in decreased absorption and increased secretion in the digestive tract: This is a mechanism of action for cholera toxin, not Shiga toxin.

D. Inhibition of elongation factor-2 (EF-2), resulting in decreased protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells: This is a mechanism of action for diphtheria toxin, not Shiga toxin.

E. Inhibition of the 60S ribosomal subunit, resulting in decreased protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells: This is a mechanism of action for ricin toxin, not Shiga toxin.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",Success
"A 46-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with one week of intermittent nausea and vomiting. She does not have any sick contacts, and her medical history is significant only for diabetes well-controlled on metformin. She also complains of some weakness and back/leg pain. She says that she recently returned from traveling abroad and had been administered an antibiotic during her travels for an unknown infection. On presentation, her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 119/78 mmHg, pulse is 62/min, and respirations are 25/min. An EKG is obtained showing flattening of the T wave. After further testing, the physician prescribes a thiazide for this patient. Which of the following diseases is also associated with this patient's most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is C. Sjogren syndrome.

The patient's symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, weakness, and back/leg pain, along with the EKG finding of flattened T waves, suggest hypokalemia (low potassium levels). The prescription of a thiazide diuretic further supports this diagnosis, as thiazides can cause potassium loss.

The most likely diagnosis is hypokalemia due to Gitelman syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalciuria. Gitelman syndrome is often associated with Sjogren syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that affects exocrine glands, particularly the salivary and lacrimal glands.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and diagnosis:

A. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints, and it is not typically associated with hypokalemia or Gitelman syndrome.

B. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects hemoglobin production, leading to anemia and other complications. It is not related to hypokalemia or Gitelman syndrome.

D. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disorder that can affect various organs, but it is not typically associated with hypokalemia or Gitelman syndrome.

E. Wilson disease is a genetic disorder that affects copper metabolism, leading to liver and brain damage. It is not related to hypokalemia or Gitelman syndrome.

It's essential to note that the patient's recent travel and antibiotic use may have contributed to her symptoms, but they are not the primary cause of her condition.",Success
"A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. He was the front seat unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale of 5 and is subsequently intubated. Physical exam is notable for subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area. Needle decompression and chest tube placement are performed, and the patient is stabilized after receiving 2 units of blood and 2 liters of fluid. Chest radiography demonstrates proper tube location and resolution of the pneumothorax. The patient is transferred to the trauma intensive care unit. On the unit, a repeat chest radiograph is notable for a recurrent pneumothorax with the chest tube in place. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Tracheobronchial rupture.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation with subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area and a pneumothorax after a motor vehicle collision suggests a high-energy trauma to the chest. The initial chest radiograph shows resolution of the pneumothorax after chest tube placement, but the repeat radiograph demonstrates a recurrent pneumothorax despite the chest tube being in place. This suggests that there is a persistent air leak, which is not being adequately addressed by the chest tube.

Tracheobronchial rupture is a serious injury that can occur due to blunt trauma to the chest. It is characterized by a tear in the trachea or bronchi, leading to an air leak that can cause a pneumothorax. The presence of subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area is a classic sign of tracheobronchial rupture. The fact that the pneumothorax recurs despite chest tube placement suggests that the air leak is not being adequately addressed, which is consistent with a tracheobronchial rupture.

Option A, esophageal rupture, is unlikely as it would not typically cause a pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area. Option B, inappropriate chest tube placement, is possible but less likely as the initial chest radiograph showed resolution of the pneumothorax, suggesting that the chest tube was initially placed correctly. Option C, spontaneous pneumothorax, is unlikely in the context of a high-energy trauma. Option D, tension pneumothorax, is not supported by the patient's presentation, as the pneumothorax was initially resolved with chest tube placement, and the patient was stabilized.",Success
"A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 12 hours after the sudden onset of shortness of breath and substernal chest pain at rest; the pain is increased by inspiration. He has also had a nonproductive cough, fever, and malaise for the past 5 days. He does not smoke or use illicit drugs. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 125/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 85/45 mm Hg. Physical examination shows distended neck veins. Auscultation of the chest discloses bilateral basilar rales and muffled heart sounds. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia, diffuse ST segment elevation, low voltage QRS complexes, and fluctuating R wave amplitude. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Cardiac tamponade.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space, leading to compression of the heart and impaired cardiac function.

The key findings that support this diagnosis are:

1. Substernal chest pain increased by inspiration (pleuritic pain), which is a common feature of pericarditis and cardiac tamponade.
2. Distended neck veins, indicating increased central venous pressure, which is a hallmark of cardiac tamponade.
3. Muffled heart sounds, which suggest that the heart is surrounded by fluid, reducing the intensity of the heart sounds.
4. Bilateral basilar rales, indicating pulmonary congestion and edema, which can occur in cardiac tamponade due to increased pressure in the pulmonary veins.
5. The ECG findings, including sinus tachycardia, diffuse ST segment elevation, low voltage QRS complexes, and fluctuating R wave amplitude, are consistent with pericarditis and cardiac tamponade.

While the other options are plausible, they are less likely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis that typically affects children and is characterized by fever, rash, and coronary artery aneurysms. It is unlikely to cause the patient's symptoms.

B. Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that can cause pericarditis, but it is typically seen in children and young adults, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with cardiac tamponade.

C. Dressler syndrome is a late complication of myocardial infarction, characterized by pericarditis and pleuritis. While it can cause similar symptoms, the patient's ECG findings and physical examination are more consistent with cardiac tamponade.

D. Infective endocarditis is a bacterial infection of the heart valves, which can cause fever, malaise, and cardiac symptoms. However, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with cardiac tamponade.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, cardiac tamponade is the most likely diagnosis.",Success
A 34-year-old man comes to the physician because of frequent headaches and blurry vision during the past 4 months. He has also had difficulties achieving an erection over the past few weeks. Physical examination shows a temporal visual field deficit bilaterally. An MRI of the brain shows an intrasellar mass. The mass is most likely derived from which of the following types of cells?,B,"The correct answer is B. Lactotrophs.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including frequent headaches, blurry vision, and bilateral temporal visual field deficits, suggest a mass compressing the optic chiasm, which is a common presentation of a pituitary adenoma. The MRI of the brain confirms an intrasellar mass.

Pituitary adenomas are benign tumors that arise from the anterior pituitary gland. The symptoms of erectile dysfunction in this patient suggest a prolactin-secreting adenoma, also known as a prolactinoma. Prolactinomas are the most common type of pituitary adenoma, accounting for approximately 40% of all pituitary tumors.

Lactotrophs are the cells in the anterior pituitary gland that produce prolactin, a hormone involved in lactation and reproductive function. Excess prolactin production can lead to symptoms such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and erectile dysfunction.

The other options are not as likely:

A. Thyrotrophs produce thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which regulates thyroid function. While a thyrotroph adenoma could cause symptoms related to thyroid dysfunction, it would not typically cause visual field deficits or erectile dysfunction.

C. Somatotrophs produce growth hormone, which regulates growth and development. A somatotroph adenoma could cause symptoms related to growth hormone excess, such as acromegaly, but would not typically cause visual field deficits or erectile dysfunction.

D. Gonadotrophs produce follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which regulate reproductive function. A gonadotroph adenoma could cause symptoms related to reproductive dysfunction, but would not typically cause visual field deficits or erectile dysfunction.

E. Corticotrophs produce adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which regulates cortisol production. A corticotroph adenoma could cause symptoms related to Cushing's syndrome, but would not typically cause visual field deficits or erectile dysfunction.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis is a prolactin-secreting adenoma derived from lactotrophs.",Success
A 33-year-old G2P1 woman presents to the office because of poor diabetic control. She is currently at 18 weeks gestation and admits to having poor control of her type 1 diabetes before becoming pregnant. Her family history is non-contributory. The physical examination shows a pregnant woman with a fundal height of 20 cm (7.9 in). An abdominal ultrasound is ordered. Which of the following is the most likely congenital abnormality shown on the ultrasound?,E,"The correct answer is C. Sacral agenesis.

The patient's poor control of type 1 diabetes before becoming pregnant increases the risk of congenital anomalies in the fetus. The most common congenital anomalies associated with maternal diabetes are neural tube defects, cardiovascular defects, and caudal regression syndrome.

Sacral agenesis, also known as caudal regression syndrome, is a congenital anomaly that is more common in infants of mothers with diabetes. It is characterized by abnormal development of the lower spine and pelvis. The risk of sacral agenesis is increased in women with pregestational diabetes, especially if they have poor glycemic control during the critical period of embryogenesis (3-8 weeks).

While anencephaly (B) and spina bifida (D) are both neural tube defects that can be associated with maternal diabetes, they are not as specifically linked to poor glycemic control as sacral agenesis. Amelia (A) is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by the absence of one or more limbs, and it is not typically associated with maternal diabetes. Ventricular septal defect (E) is a common congenital heart defect, but it is not as strongly linked to maternal diabetes as sacral agenesis.

It's important to note that the patient's fundal height of 20 cm at 18 weeks gestation is within normal limits, but it's not directly related to the congenital anomaly that might be present.",Success
"A 45-year-old G3P3 presents complaining of the feeling of a foreign body in her vagina that worsens on standing. She does not have urinary or fecal incontinence or any other genitourinary symptoms.

She is sexually active with her husband and no longer uses oral contraceptives. She has an 11 pack-year history of smoking. Her weight is 79 kg (174 lb) and her height is 155 cm (5 ft). Her vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination is unremarkable. The gynecologic examination reveals descent of the cervix halfway towards the introitus. On Valsalva and standing, the cervix descents to the plane of the hymen. The uterus is not enlarged and the ovaries are non-palpable. Which of the following treatments is most reasonable to offer this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Support pessary.

The patient's symptoms, specifically the feeling of a foreign body in her vagina that worsens on standing, are consistent with a diagnosis of uterine prolapse. The physical examination findings, including descent of the cervix halfway towards the introitus and further descent to the plane of the hymen on Valsalva and standing, support this diagnosis.

A support pessary is a reasonable treatment option for this patient because it can provide mechanical support to the uterus and alleviate symptoms. Pessaries are a non-surgical treatment option that can be used to manage uterine prolapse, and they are often recommended as a first-line treatment.

Option B, estrogen therapy, may be used to treat vaginal atrophy or dryness, but it is not a primary treatment for uterine prolapse.

Option C, space-filling pessary, is not a suitable option for this patient because it is typically used for more advanced stages of prolapse or for patients with multiple compartment defects.

Options D, posterior colporrhaphy, and E, sacral colpopexy, are surgical options that may be considered for more advanced stages of prolapse or for patients who have failed conservative management. However, they are not the most reasonable initial treatment option for this patient.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that pessaries be considered as a first-line treatment for women with uterine prolapse, especially for those who are not surgical candidates or who prefer a non-surgical approach.",Success
"A 36-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 2, comes to the emergency department because of sudden-onset, severe right flank pain. She was in her aerobics class when the pain started but denies any trauma to the region. She has a history of recurrent ovarian cysts. Menses occur regularly at 28-day intervals. Her temperature is 37.1°C (99.3°F). Abdominal examination shows tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding. Pelvic ultrasound shows a large simple cyst on the right ovary. Right ovarian artery flow is detectable on Doppler, but there is no flow detected in the right ovarian vein. Which of the following ligaments is most likely to have been involved?",E,"The correct answer is E. Infundibulopelvic ligament.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings suggest ovarian torsion, which is a surgical emergency. Ovarian torsion occurs when the ovary twists on its ligamentous attachments, cutting off its own blood supply. The infundibulopelvic ligament is the most likely ligament involved in ovarian torsion, as it is the primary suspensiony ligament of the ovary.

The infundibulopelvic ligament is a fibrous cord that attaches the ovary to the pelvic sidewall and contains the ovarian vessels. Torsion of the ovary typically occurs when the ovary twists on this ligament, causing occlusion of the ovarian vessels and resulting in ischemia and pain.

The other options are not directly related to ovarian torsion:

A. Broad ligament: This ligament supports the uterus, but it is not directly involved in ovarian torsion.

B. Round ligament of the uterus: This ligament supports the uterus, but it is not related to ovarian torsion.

C. Ovarian ligament: This ligament connects the ovary to the uterus, but it is not the primary suspensiony ligament of the ovary and is not typically involved in ovarian torsion.

D. Cardinal ligament: This ligament provides support to the uterus and cervix, but it is not related to ovarian torsion.

It's essential to note that ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency that requires prompt evaluation and treatment to prevent ovarian necrosis and infertility.",Success
"A 69-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She feels well. Physical examination shows nontender cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. The spleen is palpated 5 cm below the costal margin. Her leukocyte count is 12,000/mm3 and platelet count is 217,000/mm3. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?",C,"The correct answer is C. Smudge cells.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). CLL is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, characterized by the abnormal growth of lymphocytes.

The presence of nontender cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly (enlarged spleen), and a normal leukocyte count with a normal platelet count are all consistent with CLL. Smudge cells, which are fragile lymphocytes that break apart during blood smear preparation, are a characteristic finding in CLL.

Ringed sideroblasts (Option A) are typically seen in myelodysplastic syndromes, not CLL. Teardrop cells (Option B) are seen in myelofibrosis, a different type of blood disorder. Reed-Sternberg cells (Option D) are characteristic of Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the immune system. Hypergammaglobulinemia (Option E) is an increase in immunoglobulins in the blood, which can be seen in various conditions, including CLL, but it is not a specific finding that would confirm the diagnosis.

According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, the diagnosis of CLL is based on the presence of at least 5,000 monoclonal B cells per microliter in the blood, along with characteristic morphological and immunophenotypic features, including smudge cells.",Success
"A 24-year-old married woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain since last night. She also complains of scant vaginal bleeding. She says she visited a physician last year who said she had a pelvic infection, but she was never treated because of insurance issues. She also says her period has been delayed this month. She is afebrile. The pulse is 124/min and the blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. On examination, her abdomen is distended and tender. A pregnancy test was positive. A complication of infection with which of the following organisms most likely led to this patient’s condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Chlamydia trachomatis.

Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, it is likely that she has a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. The patient's delayed period, positive pregnancy test, and severe abdominal pain are all consistent with this diagnosis. The fact that she had a pelvic infection last year, which was not treated, increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy.

Chlamydia trachomatis is a common cause of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to scarring and adhesions in the fallopian tubes. This scarring can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy, as the fertilized egg may not be able to pass through the damaged tube and instead implants in the tube, leading to an ectopic pregnancy.

While the other options are also possible causes of pelvic infections, they are less likely to be associated with ectopic pregnancy. Candida albicans is typically associated with yeast infections, not PID. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Mycoplasma genitalium can also cause PID, but they are less common causes of ectopic pregnancy. Haemophilus influenzae is not typically associated with PID or ectopic pregnancy.

It's worth noting that the patient's symptoms and medical history are consistent with a high-risk profile for ectopic pregnancy, and immediate medical attention is necessary to rule out this life-threatening condition.",Success
A 44-year-old man comes to the clinic because of a 6-month history of progressive fatigue. He has a history of intravenous heroin use. Physical examination shows scleral icterus. A serum study is positive for hepatitis C RNA. Therapy with interferon-α is initiated in combination with a second drug. The expected beneficial effect of the additional drug is most likely due to inhibition of which of the following enzymes?,B,"The correct answer is B. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase.

The patient is being treated for hepatitis C with interferon-α and a second drug, which is likely ribavirin. Ribavirin is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP). By inhibiting IMPDH, ribavirin reduces the availability of GTP, which is necessary for viral RNA synthesis. This mechanism of action contributes to the antiviral effects of ribavirin against hepatitis C virus.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. DNA integrase is an enzyme involved in the integration of viral DNA into host chromosomes, but it's not related to hepatitis C treatment or ribavirin's mechanism of action.

C. DNA-dependent RNA polymerase is an enzyme involved in transcription, but it's not a target of ribavirin.

D. DNA gyrase is an enzyme involved in bacterial DNA replication, but it's not relevant to hepatitis C treatment or ribavirin's mechanism of action.

E. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase is an enzyme involved in the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides, but it's not directly related to ribavirin's mechanism of action against hepatitis C virus.

"A 42-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of fatigue. He has not been to the doctor since he was 22 years of age. He reports that over the past three months, he has felt tired and weak despite no changes in diet or exercise. He is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. Family history is notable for colorectal cancer in his father and paternal uncle, ovarian cancer in his paternal grandmother, and pancreatic cancer in his paternal uncle. Physical examination is notable for conjunctival pallor. A complete blood count reveals a hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL and hematocrit of 31%. A stool sample is hemoccult positive and a colonoscopy reveals a fungating hemorrhagic mass in the ascending colon. Which of the following processes is most likely impaired in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Mismatch repair.

Here's why:

The patient's family history is suggestive of Lynch syndrome, a hereditary cancer syndrome characterized by an increased risk of colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, and other cancers. Lynch syndrome is caused by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, such as MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2.

The patient's symptoms, including fatigue, conjunctival pallor, and a positive stool sample for occult blood, are consistent with anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding from a colon cancer. The colonoscopy finding of a fungating hemorrhagic mass in the ascending colon further supports this diagnosis.

Mismatch repair is a process that corrects errors in DNA replication and recombination. Defects in MMR genes lead to microsatellite instability, which is a hallmark of Lynch syndrome. Impaired mismatch repair increases the risk of cancer development, particularly in the colon and other organs.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and family history:

A. Homologous recombination is a process involved in DNA double-strand break repair and is not directly related to Lynch syndrome.

B. Base excision repair is a process that corrects oxidative DNA damage and is not typically associated with Lynch syndrome.

C. Nucleotide excision repair is a process that corrects bulky DNA lesions, such as those caused by ultraviolet light, and is not directly related to Lynch syndrome.

"A 38-year-old woman presents to an urgent care clinic with the complaint of epigastric discomfort and cramping pain for the past 2 hours. She states that she has experienced similar pain in the past. These episodes occur mostly after meals and often subside several hours after she finishes eating. Due to this reason she mostly avoids eating. She says she has lost a few pounds in the last couple of months. She is a smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. Past medical history is insignificant except for chronic knee pain, for which she takes over the counter painkillers. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respiratory rate is 16/min, pulse is 77/min, and blood pressure is 120/89 mm Hg. A physical abdominal exam is unremarkable, including examination of the abdomen. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Gastric peptic ulcer.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms of epigastric discomfort and cramping pain, particularly after meals, suggest a diagnosis related to the upper gastrointestinal tract. The fact that the pain subsides several hours after eating and that she has lost weight due to avoiding food further supports this notion.

A gastric peptic ulcer is a common cause of epigastric pain that worsens after eating and improves with time. The patient's history of smoking and occasional alcohol consumption are also risk factors for peptic ulcer disease.

Option A, duodenal peptic ulcer, is also a possibility, but the symptoms are more consistent with a gastric peptic ulcer. Duodenal ulcers tend to cause pain at night and are relieved by food, whereas gastric ulcers tend to cause pain after eating.

Option B, choledocholithiasis, is unlikely given the patient's symptoms. Choledocholithiasis typically presents with right upper quadrant pain, often radiating to the back, and is associated with jaundice and abnormal liver function tests.

Option C, pancreatitis, is also unlikely. Pancreatitis typically presents with severe, constant epigastric pain that radiates to the back, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and elevated pancreatic enzymes.

Option E, gallbladder cancer, is a rare condition that typically presents with more severe symptoms, such as jaundice, weight loss, and abdominal mass, which are not present in this patient.

In conclusion, based on the patient's symptoms and risk factors, a gastric peptic ulcer is the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 19-year-old female college soccer player presents to a sports medicine clinic with right knee pain. One day prior she twisted her right knee and felt a “pop” while chasing after a ball. She has since felt severe throbbing knee pain and noticed a rapid increase in swelling around her knee. She is able to bear weight but feels “unstable” on her right leg. On exam, anterior drawer and Lachman’s tests are positive. The physician informs her that she has likely injured an important structure in her knee. What is the function of the structure that she has most likely injured?",B,"The correct answer is B. Prevent excess anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, including a positive anterior drawer and Lachman's test, suggest a likely injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The ACL is a crucial ligament in the knee that plays a vital role in stabilizing the joint and preventing excessive movement.

The ACL's primary function is to prevent excessive anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur, which means it prevents the tibia from sliding too far forward in relation to the femur. This helps to maintain knee stability and prevent injuries to other surrounding structures.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Prevent excess posterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur: This is the function of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), not the ACL.

C. Resist excess varus force on the knee: This is the function of the medial collateral ligament (MCL), not the ACL.

D. Resist excess valgus force on the knee: This is the function of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL), not the ACL.

E. Provide a cushion between the lateral tibial and femoral condyles: This is the function of the menisci, not the ACL.

It's essential to note that the ACL is a common injury in athletes, especially those involved in high-impact sports like soccer. A thorough physical exam and imaging studies, such as an MRI, can help confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment decisions.",Success
"Six hours after birth, a newborn boy is evaluated for tachypnea. He was delivered at 41 weeks' gestation via Caesarian section and the amniotic fluid was meconium-stained. His respiratory rate is 75/min. Physical examination shows increased work of breathing. X-rays of the abdomen and chest show no abnormalities. Echocardiography shows elevated pulmonary artery pressure. He is started on an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP, and there is immediate improvement in his tachypnea and oxygenation status. Three hours later, the newborn is tachypneic and there is blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this infant's cyanosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Oxidization of Fe2+ to Fe3+.

Here's why:

The newborn was initially treated with an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP, which is likely nitric oxide (NO). NO is a potent vasodilator that can help reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and improve oxygenation in newborns with pulmonary hypertension. The initial improvement in the infant's tachypnea and oxygenation status suggests that the medication was effective.

However, three hours later, the infant developed cyanosis, characterized by blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes. This is likely due to methemoglobinemia, a condition where hemoglobin (Hb) is oxidized to methemoglobin (MetHb). MetHb is unable to bind oxygen, leading to tissue hypoxia and cyanosis.

The inhaled NO can cause methemoglobinemia by oxidizing the ferrous (Fe2+) form of heme in hemoglobin to the ferric (Fe3+) form, leading to the formation of MetHb. This is the most likely cause of the infant's cyanosis.

The other options are not directly related to the scenario:

A. Increase in serum myoglobin is not a plausible explanation for the infant's cyanosis.

B. Closure of the ductus arteriosus would not cause cyanosis in this scenario.

D. Inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase is not related to the effects of inhaled NO or the development of cyanosis.

E. Allosteric alteration of heme groups is not a direct consequence of inhaled NO therapy.

It's essential to note that methemoglobinemia is a known side effect of inhaled NO therapy, and close monitoring of methemoglobin levels is necessary to prevent this complication.",Success
A study is conducted to determine the most effective ways to prevent transmission of various infective agents. One of the agents studied is a picornavirus that preferentially infects hepatocytes. The investigator determines that inactivating this virus can prevent its spread. Which of the following disinfectants is most likely to inactivate this virus?,C,"The correct answer is C. Sodium hypochlorite.

The picornavirus that preferentially infects hepatocytes is likely Hepatitis A virus (HAV). HAV is a highly infectious virus that can be transmitted through contaminated food, water, and close contact with an infected person.

Sodium hypochlorite, also known as bleach, is a strong disinfectant that is effective against a wide range of viruses, including HAV. It is commonly used to disinfect surfaces, equipment, and water to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.

The other options are not as effective against HAV:

A. Benzalkonium chloride is a quaternary ammonium compound that is effective against some viruses, but it is not as effective against HAV as sodium hypochlorite.

B. Chlorhexidine is a disinfectant that is commonly used to clean skin and surfaces, but it is not as effective against viruses as sodium hypochlorite.

D. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid that can be corrosive and is not typically used as a disinfectant.

E. Ethyl alcohol is a disinfectant that is effective against some viruses, but it is not as effective against HAV as sodium hypochlorite.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), sodium hypochlorite is recommended for disinfecting surfaces and equipment to prevent the spread of HAV.",Success
"A 34-year-old woman comes to the physician requesting prenatal care. For the past 2 months, she has had increasing breast tenderness, nausea, 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight gain, and urinary frequency. She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period. She has been trying to conceive with her husband since she stopped taking oral contraceptives 6 months ago; she was happy to tell him last week that she is pregnant. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows mild, nontender abdominal enlargement. The cervical os is closed. Urine β-hCG is negative. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Pseudocyesis.

Here's why:

* The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of pregnancy, such as breast tenderness, nausea, weight gain, and urinary frequency.
* However, the urine β-hCG test is negative, which rules out pregnancy (option C).
* The transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities, which makes ectopic pregnancy (option E) and incomplete abortion (option D) less likely.
* The patient's physical examination reveals mild, nontender abdominal enlargement, which could be attributed to other factors.
* The key to this diagnosis is the patient's strong belief that she is pregnant, despite the lack of objective evidence. This, combined with the physical symptoms, suggests a psychological component to her presentation.

Pseudocyesis, also known as false pregnancy or phantom pregnancy, is a condition in which a woman believes she is pregnant, experiencing symptoms and physical changes, but is not actually pregnant. This condition is often associated with psychological factors, such as a strong desire to become pregnant or emotional distress.

Delusion of pregnancy (option A) is a related but distinct concept, which refers to a false belief about being pregnant that is not accompanied by physical symptoms or changes.

In this case, the patient's symptoms, combined with her strong conviction that she is pregnant, despite the negative β-hCG test and normal ultrasound, point towards a diagnosis of pseudocyesis (option B).",Success
"A 60-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine physical examination. He lives in a group home and takes no medications. During the appointment, he frequently repeats the same information and needs to be reminded why he is at the doctor's office. He says that he is a famous poet and recently had a poem published in a national magazine. His vital signs are within normal limits. He has a constricted affect. Neurological examination shows no focal deficits. On mental status examination, he has no long-term memory deficits and is able to count in serial sevens without error. An MRI of the brain shows atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies. Which of the following is the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Alcohol use disorder.

The patient's symptoms, such as frequent repetition of information, lack of awareness of his surroundings, and constricted affect, suggest a diagnosis of Korsakoff syndrome. The MRI findings of atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies further support this diagnosis.

Korsakoff syndrome is a chronic neurological disorder caused by a deficiency of thiamine (Vitamin B1), often seen in individuals with a history of alcohol use disorder. The syndrome is characterized by memory impairments, particularly in the formation of new memories, as well as confabulation (filling in gaps in memory with fictional information), which is evident in the patient's claim of being a famous poet.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and MRI findings:

A. Consumption of undercooked meat is associated with trichinosis, a parasitic infection that can cause muscle pain, fever, and swelling.

B. Chronic hypertension is a risk factor for various cardiovascular conditions, but it is not directly related to Korsakoff syndrome.

C. Intravenous heroin use is associated with opioid use disorder and can lead to various health complications, but it is not a known cause of Korsakoff syndrome.

E. Spirochete infection, such as syphilis, can cause neurological symptoms, but the patient's symptoms and MRI findings are more consistent with Korsakoff syndrome.

"A medical student decides to join an immunology research center, which specifically works on capsular polysaccharide vaccine development against bacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. As a member of a research team working on the Hib vaccine, he asks his senior colleague why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers like tetanus toxoid during vaccine development. Which of the following is the best response to this question?",E,"The correct answer is A. Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgG2 dominant antibody responses.

Here's why:

Capsular polysaccharides are T-independent antigens, meaning they do not require the presence of T-cells to stimulate an immune response. However, this also means that they are not very immunogenic, especially in infants and young children. To improve the immunogenicity of these vaccines, capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers, such as tetanus toxoid.

Conjugation with a protein carrier converts the T-independent antigen into a T-dependent antigen, which requires the presence of T-cells to stimulate an immune response. This leads to the production of IgG antibodies, particularly IgG2, which are more effective at providing long-term protection against infection. IgG2 antibodies are also more effective at activating complement and opsonizing bacteria, making them more effective at preventing infection.

Option B is incorrect because conjugation with a protein carrier does not generate IgM dominant antibody responses. IgM is the primary antibody response to T-independent antigens, but conjugation with a protein carrier shifts the response to IgG.

Option C is incorrect because polysaccharides conjugated with proteins are actually T-dependent antigens, not T-independent antigens.

Option D is incorrect because conjugation with a protein carrier does not primarily improve vaccine stability.

Option E is correct in that conjugation with a protein carrier does provide effective protection to infants, but it's not the best response to the question because it doesn't explain why conjugation is necessary.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend the use of conjugate vaccines, such as Hib conjugate vaccine, for protection against Haemophilus influenzae type b infection.",Success
An investigator is studying the pattern of glutamate release from presynaptic nerve terminals in human volunteers with Alzheimer disease. The concentration of glutamate in the CA1 region of the hippocampus is measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy after Schaffer collateral fibers are electrically stimulated. Which of the following events most likely occurs immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters?,E,"The correct answer is E. Influx of calcium.

Here's why:

Neurotransmitter release from presynaptic nerve terminals is a complex process that involves a series of events. Immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters, an action potential reaches the nerve terminal, causing an influx of calcium ions through voltage-gated calcium channels. This influx of calcium triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, leading to the release of neurotransmitters, including glutamate, into the synaptic cleft.

The other options are not directly related to the events immediately prior to neurotransmitter release:

A. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors occurs postsynaptically, not presynaptically, and is involved in signal transduction pathways that can modulate neurotransmitter release, but is not a direct precursor to release.

B. Synthesis of glutamine is a metabolic process that occurs in astrocytes, not in presynaptic nerve terminals, and is not directly related to neurotransmitter release.

C. Accumulation of cAMP is a second messenger involved in various signaling pathways, but it is not a key event in the neurotransmitter release process.

D. Opening of ligand-gated ion channels occurs postsynaptically, allowing ions to flow into the postsynaptic neuron in response to neurotransmitter binding, but it is not a presynaptic event that triggers neurotransmitter release.

In this study, the investigator is using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure glutamate concentration in the CA1 region of the hippocampus after electrically stimulating Schaffer collateral fibers, which would trigger an action potential and subsequent calcium influx, leading to glutamate release.",Success

She was told by her friend that she need to see a physician because she needs to be treated as well, even if she is not having symptoms yet. She currently denies any headaches, vision changes, nausea or vomiting, or neck stiffness. Her physical exam is within normal limits. Her vital signs are stable. She is prescribed rifampin for prophylaxis with specific instructions on when to follow up if symptoms develop. When asked about the possibility of pregnancy, she mentioned that she uses combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for contraception. The physician suggested that her husband should use condoms for contraception as she requires antibiotic therapy. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the need for additional contraception?",A,"The correct answer is A. Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens.

Rifampin, an antibiotic used for meningococcal meningitis prophylaxis, can reduce the efficacy of combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) containing estrogens. This is because rifampin induces certain enzymes in the gut, leading to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens. Enterohepatic circulation refers to the process by which estrogens are reabsorbed from the gut back into the bloodstream after being conjugated and excreted into the bile. Rifampin disrupts this process, resulting in lower estrogen levels and potentially reducing the effectiveness of OCPs.

The other options are incorrect:

B. Rifampin is actually an inducer of CYP3A4, which can increase the metabolism of certain medications, including progestins. However, this is not the primary mechanism by which rifampin affects OCPs.

C. Rifampin does not alter the enterohepatic circulation of progestins, which is not a significant factor in OCP efficacy.

D. and E. Rifampin does not directly interfere with the intestinal absorption of estrogens or progestins.

The physician's recommendation for the patient's husband to use condoms is a precautionary measure to ensure adequate contraception during the period of rifampin therapy, as the efficacy of OCPs may be compromised.",Success

Physical examination shows a 0.8-cm hyperpigmented papule. When the skin lesion is squeezed, the surface retracts inwards. A photograph of the lesion is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is E. Seborrheic keratosis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with seborrheic keratosis. The lesion is described as a painless, nonpruritic, hyperpigmented papule that has slowly increased in size over the past weeks. The fact that the surface retracts inward when squeezed is a characteristic feature of seborrheic keratoses, known as the ""sign of Leser-Trelat"".

Seborrheic keratoses are benign skin growths that are common in adults, particularly in middle-aged and older individuals. They often appear as dark, raised, and irregularly shaped lesions on the skin, and can be mistaken for melanoma or other skin cancers.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

A. Dysplastic nevus: While dysplastic nevi can also appear as hyperpigmented papules, they are typically larger and more irregularly shaped than the lesion described in this scenario. Additionally, dysplastic nevi often have a more prominent border and may be pruritic.

B. Dermatofibroma: Dermatofibromas are firm, dome-shaped papules that are typically smaller than 1 cm in diameter. They are often tender to the touch and may have a characteristic ""dimple sign"" when pressed.

C. Cherry hemangioma: Cherry hemangiomas are small, bright red papules that are typically found on the trunk and extremities. They are benign vascular lesions that are not typically hyperpigmented.

D. Actinic keratosis: Actinic keratoses are small, rough, scaly patches that occur on sun-exposed areas of the skin. They are often pink or red in color and may be tender to the touch.

Which of the following is the most common complication of this patient's condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Coronary artery aneurysm.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Kawasaki disease, a vasculitis that primarily affects children under 5 years old. The classic diagnostic criteria for Kawasaki disease include:

1. Fever lasting at least 5 days
2. Bilateral conjunctival injection
3. Changes in the lips and oral cavity (erythema, cracking, or swelling)
4. Polymorphous rash
5. Cervical lymphadenopathy
6. Changes in the extremities (edema, erythema, or desquamation)

Neurological exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with normal strength and sensation in his upper and lower extremities. Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia, and pulmonary exam is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely intoxication in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is E. Phencyclidine (PCP).

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with PCP intoxication. PCP is a dissociative anesthetic that can cause anxiety, agitation, and altered mental status. The patient's delayed responses and difficulty processing thoughts suggest a dissociative state, which is a hallmark of PCP intoxication.

The physical exam findings also support this diagnosis:

* Dry mouth: PCP can cause xerostomia (dry mouth) due to its anticholinergic effects.
* Conjunctival injection: PCP can cause conjunctival injection, which is a common finding in PCP intoxication.
* Tachycardia: PCP can cause tachycardia, which is consistent with the patient's pulse of 110/min.

The other options are less likely:

* A. Alcohol: The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are not consistent with alcohol intoxication. Alcohol typically causes sedation, slurred speech, and ataxia, which are not present in this patient.
* B. Benzodiazepines: Benzodiazepines typically cause sedation, relaxation, and decreased anxiety, which is the opposite of this patient's symptoms.
* C. Marijuana: While marijuana can cause anxiety and altered mental status, it is less likely to cause the dissociative state and physical exam findings seen in this patient.
* D. Cocaine: Cocaine can cause anxiety, tachycardia, and agitation, but it is less likely to cause the dissociative state and physical exam findings seen in this patient.

The most likely cause of his condition is occlusion of a branch of which of the following arteries?,E,"The correct answer is E. Superior mesenteric artery.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain and nausea, are consistent with acute mesenteric ischemia. The laparotomy findings of dusky discoloration of the hepatic colonic flexure and an adjacent segment of the transverse colon suggest ischemia or infarction of the colon, which is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery (SMA).

The SMA is a branch of the abdominal aorta that arises at the level of L1 and supplies blood to the small intestine, cecum, ascending colon, and transverse colon. Occlusion of the SMA or its branches can lead to ischemia or infarction of the supplied intestinal segments, resulting in the symptoms and findings seen in this patient.

"A group of researchers from Italy conducted a case register study that included all patients from a city who had an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis and contacts with specialist psychiatric services over a 10-year period. Mortality was studied in relation to age, sex, diagnosis, care pattern, and registration interval. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, with the overall SMR being 1.63 (lower when compared with studies that looked at hospitalized individuals). Men and those in younger age groups showed higher mortality rates (SMRs of 2.24 and 8.82, respectively), and mortality was also higher in the first year following registration (SMR = 2.32). Higher mortality was also found in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol and drug dependence (SMR = 3.87). The authors concluded that the overall mortality of psychiatric patients managed in a community-based setting was higher than expected; however, it was still lower than the mortality described in other psychiatric settings. The primary measure used in this study can be defined as which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is D. The observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths.

The study used Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) to compare the mortality rates of psychiatric patients managed in a community-based setting with the expected mortality rates in the general population. SMR is a statistical measure that calculates the ratio of observed deaths to expected deaths in a specific population, adjusted for age and other demographic factors.

In this study, the SMR was calculated as the observed number of deaths among psychiatric patients divided by the expected number of deaths in the general population, based on age-specific mortality rates. The resulting SMR values indicate the relative mortality risk of psychiatric patients compared to the general population. For example, an SMR of 1.63 means that psychiatric patients had a 63% higher mortality rate than expected, compared to the general population.

Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the purine metabolism pathway.

The patient's symptoms, including facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements, are consistent with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT). This enzyme is involved in the purine metabolism pathway.

The patient's history of taking allopurinol, a medication used to treat gout and kidney stones, is also a clue. Allopurinol is often used to treat Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, as it reduces the production of uric acid, which is elevated in this condition.

The patient's lack of teeth, which has been present since the age of 2, is also a characteristic feature of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

A deficiency of which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Zinc.

The patient's symptoms, including hair loss, a rash on her face, and a decreased sense of taste, are consistent with zinc deficiency. The bullous, erythematous perioral plaques and circular patches of hair loss on the scalp are also characteristic of zinc deficiency.

Zinc deficiency is a common complication of Crohn disease, particularly in patients who have undergone multiple small bowel resections, as seen in this patient. The small intestine is responsible for most of the zinc absorption, and resections can lead to malabsorption of this essential nutrient.

Retinoic acid (Option A) is a derivative of vitamin A, and deficiency can cause skin and hair problems, but it is not typically associated with the specific symptoms and lesions described in this patient.

Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 138/82 mm Hg. Examination shows that the uterus is at the umbilicus. Ultrasound examination reveals normal fetal heart rate, movement, and anatomy. Routine prenatal labs show the following:
Blood type A Rh-
Leukocyte count 11,000/mm3
Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL
Platelet count 345,000/mm3

Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Repeat antibody screening at 28 weeks. Administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks and after delivery if the newborn is Rh(D) positive.

Here's why:

The patient is Rh-negative, and her previous pregnancy was unremarkable with a healthy Rh-positive child. The concern is that she may have developed anti-D antibodies during the previous pregnancy or after the blood transfusion she received 3 years ago. However, her current anti-D antibody screen is negative.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that Rh-negative women be screened for anti-D antibodies at 28 weeks of gestation. If the screen is negative at 28 weeks, anti-D immunoglobulin should be administered to prevent sensitization. Additionally, if the newborn is Rh-positive, anti-D immunoglobulin should be administered again after delivery to prevent sensitization in future pregnancies.

Option A is incorrect because anti-D immunoglobulin should not be administered now, as the patient's current screen is negative. Option C is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of the newborn being Rh-positive, which would require additional anti-D immunoglobulin administration after delivery. Option D is incorrect because it does not include the 28-week screening and administration of anti-D immunoglobulin. Option E is incorrect because further management is indeed needed to prevent sensitization and potential complications in future pregnancies.",Success
"A 52-year-old man presents to the physician because of ongoing shortness of breath, which is more prominent when he lies down. Occasionally, he experiences palpitations, especially during strenuous activities. In addition to this, he has been experiencing difficulty in digestion and often experiences regurgitation and dysphagia. He reports that he emigrated from Mexico 20 years ago and visits his hometown twice a year. The vital signs include: blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg, respiratory rate 19/min, and pulse 100/min. The physical examination shows jugular vein distention along with pitting edema in the ankles. Bilateral basilar crackles and an S3 gallop are heard on auscultation of the chest. A chest X-ray is taken. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows no significant findings. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s physical and diagnostic findings?",C,"The correct answer is C. Parasitic infection.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of chronic heart failure, specifically right-sided heart failure. The jugular vein distention, pitting edema in the ankles, and bilateral basilar crackles are all indicative of fluid overload and cardiac decompensation. The S3 gallop is a sign of ventricular dysfunction.

The patient's history of emigrating from Mexico and visiting his hometown twice a year suggests a possible exposure to Chagas disease, a parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Chagas disease is endemic in Mexico and can cause chronic heart failure, particularly right-sided heart failure, due to the parasite's tropism for cardiac tissue.

The chest X-ray and ECG findings are non-specific, but they do not suggest any other obvious causes for the patient's symptoms. While alcohol abuse (Option A) can cause cardiomyopathy, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with a parasitic infection. Hypertensive changes (Option B) may contribute to heart failure, but they do not explain the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Myocardial infarction (Option D) is unlikely given the absence of significant ECG findings. Bacterial infection (Option E) is also unlikely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

It's worth noting that Chagas disease is a rare diagnosis in the United States, but it should be considered in patients with a history of exposure in endemic areas. A definitive diagnosis would require further testing, such as serology or PCR for T. cruzi.",Success
"A 33-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with bilateral joint pain. She says that the pain has been slowly worsening over the past 3 days. Otherwise, she complains of fatigue, a subjective fever, and a sunburn on her face which she attributes to gardening. The patient is an immigrant from Spain and works as an office assistant. She is not aware of any chronic medical conditions and takes a multivitamin daily. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 125/64 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals bilateral redness over the maxillary prominences. Which of the following is most likely to be seen in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Decreased complement levels.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The bilateral joint pain, fatigue, and subjective fever are common symptoms of SLE. The bilateral redness over the maxillary prominences, also known as a malar rash, is a characteristic skin finding in SLE.

In SLE, the immune system produces excessive amounts of antibodies against various nuclear and cytoplasmic antigens, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. One of the hallmarks of SLE is the activation of the complement system, which can lead to decreased complement levels.

Option B, decreased complement levels, is a common laboratory finding in SLE, particularly during active disease flares.

The other options are not directly related to SLE:

* Option A, decreased anti-dsDNA antibodies, is the opposite of what is typically seen in SLE, where anti-dsDNA antibodies are often elevated.
* Option C, decreased anti-centromere antibodies, is more commonly associated with limited systemic sclerosis (CREST syndrome) rather than SLE.
* Option D, increased anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, is more commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis rather than SLE.
* Option E, increased anti-topoisomerase antibodies, is more commonly associated with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) rather than SLE.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of being an immigrant from Spain and working as an office assistant is not directly relevant to the diagnosis of SLE. The sunburn on her face may be related to her gardening activity, but it's not a key factor in the diagnosis.",Success
"A 40-year-old man comes to the emergency department with a 4-day history of left leg pain. Over the weekend, he scraped his left thigh when he fell on a muddy field while playing flag football with some friends. Since that time, he has had progressively worsening redness and pain in his left thigh. Past medical history is unremarkable. His temperature is 39.4°C (103.0°F), heart rate is 120/min, and blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg. Physical exam is significant for a poorly-demarcated area of redness on his left thigh, extending to about a 10 cm radius from a small scrape. This area is extremely tender to palpation, and palpation elicits an unusual 'crunchy' sensation. CT scan shows free air in the soft tissue of the left leg. The organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation is also a common cause of which of the following conditions?",D,"The correct answer is D. Food-borne illness.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is necrotizing fasciitis caused by Clostridium perfringens. The ""crunchy"" sensation on palpation is consistent with the presence of gas in the soft tissue, which is a hallmark of this infection. The CT scan showing free air in the soft tissue further supports this diagnosis.

Clostridium perfringens is a common cause of food-borne illness, particularly in cases of improperly cooked or stored meat. It can also cause wound infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis, especially in traumatic wounds contaminated with soil or feces.

The other options are not directly related to Clostridium perfringens:

A. Bacterial endocarditis is typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Enterococcus species.

B. Bacterial pneumonia is often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Legionella pneumophila.

C. Bacterial sinusitis is commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis.

E. Urinary tract infections are typically caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Staphylococcus saprophyticus.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Food-borne illness.",Success
"A 75-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a racing heart and lightheadedness for 3 hours. He has had similar episodes in the past, but the symptoms never lasted this long.

An ECG shows the absence of P-waves with an irregular RR complex. A few hours later, his symptoms subside and he is discharged with an additional anticoagulation drug. Which of the following mechanisms explains how this new medication will exert its effects?",D,"The correct answer is D. Inhibition of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.

The patient's symptoms and ECG findings are consistent with atrial fibrillation (AFib), a type of cardiac arrhythmia. The patient's history of myocardial infarction and current medications suggest that they are at risk for thromboembolic events. The addition of an anticoagulation drug is likely to prevent stroke and systemic embolism.

Given the patient's symptoms and diagnosis, the most likely anticoagulation drug added to their regimen is warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist. Warfarin works by inhibiting the production of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, specifically factors II, VII, IX, and X. This reduces the formation of thrombi and prevents embolic events.

The other options are not directly related to the management of atrial fibrillation or the prevention of thromboembolic events:

A. Activation of the antithrombin enzyme is the mechanism of action of heparin, which is not typically used for long-term anticoagulation in AFib.

B. Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzyme is the mechanism of action of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are not used for anticoagulation.

C. Inhibition of the ADP receptors is the mechanism of action of antiplatelet agents like clopidogrel, which is not typically used for anticoagulation in AFib.

E. Blockage of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors is the mechanism of action of antiplatelet agents like abciximab, which is not typically used for anticoagulation in AFib.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Inhibition of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.",Success
"A 31-year-old man, who was hospitalized for substance-induced psychosis two days prior, has had episodic neck stiffness and pain for the past 8 hours. These episodes last for approximately 25 minutes and are accompanied by his neck rotating to the right. During the last episode, he was able to relieve the stiffness by lightly touching his jaw. He has received six doses of haloperidol for auditory hallucinations since his admission. He appears anxious. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 108/min, and blood pressure is 128/86 mm Hg. Examination shows a flexed neck rotated to the right. The neck is rigid with limited range of motion. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Benztropine.

The patient's symptoms, including episodic neck stiffness and pain, neck rotation, and relief with lightly touching his jaw, are consistent with a diagnosis of acute dystonic reaction, a known side effect of antipsychotic medications like haloperidol. The patient's recent hospitalization for substance-induced psychosis and receipt of six doses of haloperidol for auditory hallucinations support this diagnosis.

Benztropine, an anticholinergic medication, is the most appropriate therapy for acute dystonic reactions. It is commonly used to treat extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) associated with antipsychotic medications, including dystonia, parkinsonism, and akathisia. Benztropine works by blocking the action of acetylcholine in the brain, which helps to reduce muscle stiffness and spasms.

The other options are not directly related to the treatment of acute dystonic reactions:

B. Physical therapy may be helpful in managing chronic dystonia, but it is not the primary treatment for acute dystonic reactions.

C. Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant used to treat malignant hyperthermia, a life-threatening condition caused by certain medications, including anesthetics and antipsychotics. While it may have some effect on muscle stiffness, it is not the first-line treatment for acute dystonic reactions.

D. Baclofen is a muscle relaxant used to treat spasticity, particularly in patients with spinal cord injuries or multiple sclerosis. It is not typically used to treat acute dystonic reactions.

E. Propranolol is a beta blocker used to treat various conditions, including hypertension, anxiety, and tremors. While it may have some anxiolytic effects, it is not specifically indicated for the treatment of acute dystonic reactions.

In summary, benztropine is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms, given the diagnosis of acute dystonic reaction secondary to haloperidol use.",Success
"A 31-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with fevers, chills, and night sweats. After a physical exam and a series of laboratory tests, the patient undergoes a lymph node biopsy (Image A). Three days later, while awaiting treatment, he presents to his physician complaining of generalized swelling and is found to have 4+ protein in his urine. Which of the following pathological findings is most likely to be found on renal biopsy in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Minimal change disease.

The patient's symptoms, including fevers, chills, and night sweats, suggest an underlying lymphoproliferative disorder. The lymph node biopsy (Image A) likely shows Hodgkin lymphoma, given the patient's age and symptoms.

The sudden onset of nephrotic syndrome, characterized by 4+ protein in the urine, in the setting of Hodgkin lymphoma is strongly suggestive of minimal change disease. This is a well-known paraneoplastic phenomenon, where the lymphoma triggers an immune response that damages the glomeruli, leading to proteinuria.

Minimal change disease is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, and it is often associated with Hodgkin lymphoma. The other options are less likely:

A. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is a more aggressive and acute form of glomerulonephritis, which is not typically associated with Hodgkin lymphoma.

B. Amyloidosis is a possibility, but it would typically present with a more insidious onset of proteinuria, and the patient's age and symptoms make it less likely.

C. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a type of glomerulonephritis that can be associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, but it is less common than minimal change disease in this setting.

D. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is a pattern of glomerular injury that can be seen in various conditions, including HIV, obesity, and genetic disorders, but it is not typically associated with Hodgkin lymphoma.

In summary, the patient's symptoms, lymph node biopsy, and sudden onset of nephrotic syndrome make minimal change disease the most likely finding on renal biopsy.",Success
"A microbiologist has isolated several colonies of Escherichia coli on an agar plate. The microbiologist exposes the agar plate to ciprofloxacin, which destroys all of the bacteria except for one surviving colony. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of antibiotic resistance in the surviving colony?",B,"The correct answer is B. Mutation of DNA gyrase.

Here's why:

Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that works by inhibiting DNA gyrase, an enzyme essential for bacterial DNA replication. DNA gyrase is responsible for introducing negative supercoils into bacterial DNA, allowing it to replicate. Ciprofloxacin binds to DNA gyrase, preventing it from performing its function, ultimately leading to bacterial death.

In this scenario, the surviving colony of E. coli is likely to have developed resistance to ciprofloxacin due to a mutation in the DNA gyrase enzyme. This mutation would render the enzyme insensitive to ciprofloxacin, allowing the bacteria to continue replicating despite the presence of the antibiotic.

The other options are not directly related to ciprofloxacin resistance:

A. Replacement of D-alanine is a mechanism of resistance to vancomycin, not ciprofloxacin.

C. Inactivation by bacterial transferase is a mechanism of resistance to aminoglycosides, not ciprofloxacin.

D. Production of β-lactamase is a mechanism of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, not ciprofloxacin.

E. Modification of surface binding proteins is not a known mechanism of antibiotic resistance to ciprofloxacin.

Therefore, the most likely mechanism of antibiotic resistance in the surviving colony is a mutation of DNA gyrase (Option B).",Success

The patient’s son adds that his father has been having some behavioral problems, as well, and that he was complaining about bugs crawling over his skin this morning even though there were no insects. Past medical history is unremarkable. No current medications. The patient was an alcoholic for several years but abruptly quit drinking 5 days ago. The patient’s temperature is 40.0°C (104.0°F), pulse is 130/min, blood pressure is 146/88 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical examination, he is confused, restless, agitated, and lacks orientation to time, place or person. Which of the following the most appropriate initial course of treatment of this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Diazepam.

This patient is presenting with symptoms of delirium tremens (DTs), a severe and potentially life-threatening complication of alcohol withdrawal. The symptoms include fever, tachycardia, hypertension, agitation, confusion, and hallucinations (in this case, the patient is complaining of bugs crawling on his skin).

Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that is commonly used to treat alcohol withdrawal syndrome, including DTs. It is effective in reducing the symptoms of DTs, such as agitation, tremors, and hallucinations, and can help to prevent seizures and other complications.

Chlorpromazine (A) is an antipsychotic medication that may be used to treat agitation and psychosis in patients with DTs, but it is not the first-line treatment.

Clonidine (B) is an alpha-2 agonist that is sometimes used to treat hypertension and anxiety in patients with alcohol withdrawal, but it is not specifically indicated for DTs.

Haloperidol (D) is an antipsychotic medication that may be used to treat agitation and psychosis in patients with DTs, but it can lower the seizure threshold and is not the first-line treatment.

Phenytoin (E) is an anticonvulsant medication that is not typically used to treat DTs.

"Eight weeks after starting a new weight-loss medication, a 43-year-old woman with obesity comes to the physician because of greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence. She also complains of progressively worsening night-time vision. She has had no fever, chills, or vomiting. Physical examination shows dry, scaly skin on her extremities and face. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of action of the drug she is taking?",D,"The correct answer is D. Inhibition of lipase.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence, suggest malabsorption of fat, which is a hallmark of lipase inhibition. Additionally, the patient's dry, scaly skin on her extremities and face, as well as her complaint of worsening night-time vision, are indicative of fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, particularly vitamin A deficiency. This is consistent with the inhibition of lipase, which would reduce the absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins.

Orlistat, a medication commonly used for weight loss, works by inhibiting gastric and pancreatic lipases, which are enzymes that break down dietary fats into absorbable fatty acids. By inhibiting lipase, orlistat reduces the absorption of dietary fats, leading to weight loss. However, this mechanism of action can also cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as diarrhea, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and are not likely mechanisms of action for a weight-loss medication:

A. Stimulation of monoamine neurotransmitter release is a mechanism of action for certain antidepressant medications, not weight-loss medications.

B. Inhibition of serotonin reuptake is a mechanism of action for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are used to treat depression and anxiety disorders.

C. Stimulation of norepinephrine release is a mechanism of action for certain medications used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression.

A 70-year-old man with chronic heart failure presents to the emergency department due to difficulty in breathing. The patient is a known hypertensive for 20 years maintained on amlodipine and telmisartan. The physician notes that he is also being given a diuretic that blocks the Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule. Which drug is being referred to in this case?,C,"The correct answer is C. Triamterene.

Here's why:

The question states that the patient is taking a diuretic that blocks the Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule. This is a characteristic of potassium-sparing diuretics, specifically triamterene. Triamterene works by blocking the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) in the cortical collecting tubule, reducing sodium reabsorption and increasing potassium excretion.

Furosemide (Option A) is a loop diuretic that inhibits the Na+/K+/2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, not the Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule.

Hydrochlorothiazide (Option B) is a thiazide diuretic that inhibits the Na+/Cl- symporter in the distal convoluted tubule, not the Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule.

Acetazolamide (Option D) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that works in the proximal convoluted tubule, not the cortical collecting tubule.

Eplerenone (Option E) is an aldosterone antagonist that blocks the effects of aldosterone on the distal nephron, but it does not directly block Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule.

Therefore, the correct answer is Triamterene (Option C).",Success

The vital signs include blood pressure 85/67 mm Hg, pulse rate 107/min, and respiratory rate 35/min. Upon examination, the man is currently afebrile but is lethargic and pale. His spleen is surgically absent. There are some swollen bite marks on his right hand with red streaks extending to his elbow. Which of the following bites would be most concerning in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is C. Spider bite.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and lethargy, suggest a severe infection. The presence of swollen bite marks on his right hand with red streaks extending to his elbow indicates a potential cellulitis or lymphangitis. The patient's history of sickle cell disease and asplenia (surgically absent spleen) make him more susceptible to severe infections, particularly those caused by encapsulated bacteria like Capnocytophaga canimorsus.

While all the options are potential bite-related infections, a spider bite (Option C) is the most concerning in this patient. Specifically, a bite from a brown recluse spider (Loxosceles reclusa) can cause necrotic lesions, which can lead to severe systemic infections, including sepsis, in immunocompromised individuals like this patient.

Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a bacterium commonly found in the saliva of dogs and cats, which can cause severe sepsis in asplenic individuals. However, the symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with a spider bite.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

A. Cat bite: While Capnocytophaga canimorsus is a concern in asplenic individuals, the symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with a spider bite.

B. Human bite: Human bites are typically not associated with severe systemic infections, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a spider bite.

D. Fish bite: Fish bites are not typically associated with severe infections, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a spider bite.

Patellar reflex is 4+ bilaterally and plantar reflex shows an extensor response on both sides. Abdominal reflex is absent. An MRI of the brain is shown. Which of the following findings is most likely to further support the diagnosis in this patient?,C,"The correct answer is C. Presence of immunoglobulin bands on cerebrospinal fluid immunofixation.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). The MRI of the brain likely shows demyelinating lesions, which are characteristic of MS.

Option C, presence of immunoglobulin bands on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immunofixation, is a diagnostic test that supports the diagnosis of MS. In MS, the immune system produces abnormal antibodies against the central nervous system, which can be detected in the CSF. The presence of oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in the CSF, but not in the serum, is a common finding in MS and can help confirm the diagnosis.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Positive antibody response to cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen in the serum is a test for syphilis, not MS.

B. Oligodendrocytes that stain positive for polyomavirus proteins on brain biopsy are not a characteristic finding in MS. Polyomavirus is a type of virus that can cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare condition that can occur in immunocompromised individuals.

D. Identification of gram-positive cocci in groups on blood culture suggests a diagnosis of bacteremia, which is not related to the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings.

E. Detection of high-affinity antibodies to dsDNA in the serum is a test for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), not MS.

According to the 2017 McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of MS, the presence of OCBs in the CSF is one of the diagnostic criteria that can support the diagnosis of MS.",Success

They also identify a group of 50 people without interstitial lung disease who are matched in age and geographic location to those with the disease. The participants' exposure to the chemical is assessed by surveys and home visits. Which of the following best describes this study design?,A,"The correct answer is A. Case-control study.

Here's why:

* The study identifies a group of people with a specific disease (interstitial lung disease) and a group of people without the disease, matched for certain characteristics (age and geographic location). This is a hallmark of a case-control study, where cases (people with the disease) are compared to controls (people without the disease).
* The study assesses exposure to the fire retardant chemical through surveys and home visits, which is a common approach in case-control studies to gather information about potential risk factors.
* The study is not a cross-sectional study (B) because it does not involve a single point-in-time measurement of the population. Instead, it compares two groups with and without the disease.
* It's not a case series (C) because a case series typically involves a descriptive study of a series of cases with a particular condition, without a control group.
* It's not a retrospective cohort study (D) because it doesn't involve following a group of people over time to see who develops the disease. Instead, the disease status is already known, and the study is looking back in time to assess exposure to the chemical.
* Finally, it's not a randomized controlled trial (E) because there is no randomization or intervention involved in the study. The study is observational, aiming to identify an association between the chemical and the disease.

In summary, the study design is a classic case-control study, where cases and controls are compared to identify potential risk factors for a disease.",Success
"A 41-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a suicide attempt. His wife found him on the bathroom floor with an empty bottle of medication next to him. He has a history of major depressive disorder. His only medication is nortriptyline. His pulse is 127/min and blood pressure is 90/61 mm Hg. Examination shows dilated pupils and dry skin. The abdomen is distended and there is dullness on percussion in the suprapubic region. An ECG shows tachycardia and a QRS complex width of 130 ms. In addition to intravenous fluid resuscitation, which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",E,"The correct answer is E. Sodium bicarbonate.

The patient's symptoms and ECG findings are consistent with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) toxicity, specifically nortriptyline overdose. The widened QRS complex (>100 ms) is a hallmark of TCA toxicity, and the patient's tachycardia, dilated pupils, dry skin, and abdominal distension are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Sodium bicarbonate is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy in this scenario because it helps to alkalize the blood and reduce the toxicity of the TCA. Sodium bicarbonate works by increasing the pH of the blood, which reduces the free fraction of the TCA and decreases its toxicity. This is known as the ""alkalization"" effect.

Intravenous sodium bicarbonate is recommended by the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology (AACT) for the treatment of TCA-induced cardiac toxicity. The goal is to maintain a pH between 7.45 and 7.55.

The other options are not correct:

A. Atropine is not indicated for TCA toxicity.

B. Naloxone is used to reverse opioid overdoses, not TCA toxicity.

C. Cyproheptadine is an antihistamine that is not used to treat TCA toxicity.

D. Ammonium chloride is not recommended for TCA toxicity and can actually worsen the condition by increasing the acidity of the blood.

"A 23-year-old woman presents to the hospital for elective surgery. However, due to an unexpected bleeding event, the physician had to order a blood transfusion to replace the blood lost in the surgery. After this, the patient became irritable and had difficulty breathing, suggesting an allergic reaction, which was immediately treated with epinephrine. This patient is otherwise healthy, and her history does not indicate any health conditions or known allergies. The physician suspects an immunodeficiency disorder that was not previously diagnosed. If serum is taken from this patient to analyze her condition further, which of the following would be expected?",C,"The correct answer is A. High IgM, low IgA, and IgE.

The patient's symptoms, such as an allergic reaction to the blood transfusion, suggest an immunodeficiency disorder. Given the patient's history of no known allergies or health conditions, the physician suspects an underlying immunodeficiency disorder that was not previously diagnosed.

The patient's reaction to the blood transfusion is consistent with an allergic reaction, which is often mediated by IgE antibodies. However, the patient's symptoms also suggest a more underlying immunodeficiency disorder.

The expected laboratory finding in this scenario would be high IgM levels, with low or absent IgA and IgE levels. This is consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by the inability to produce mature B cells and a lack of immunoglobulins, including IgA and IgE. IgM levels are often elevated in this condition due to the presence of immature B cells that produce IgM.

Option A is the correct answer because it reflects the expected laboratory findings in Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, which is a possible underlying diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and reaction to the blood transfusion.

The other options are not correct because:

* Option B is inconsistent with the patient's symptoms and would not explain the allergic reaction to the blood transfusion.
* Option C is possible but less likely, as it would not explain the patient's allergic reaction.
* Option D is inconsistent with the patient's symptoms and would suggest an allergic disorder rather than an immunodeficiency disorder.
* Option E is unlikely, given the patient's symptoms and reaction to the blood transfusion, which suggest an underlying immunodeficiency disorder.",Success
"A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being found unconscious in his apartment by his mother. On arrival, he is unable to provide history. The mother reports that there is no history of serious illness in the family. The patient appears drowsy and dehydrated. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 170/100 mm Hg. Examination shows several track marks on his forearms and large contusions over his forehead, legs, and back. There is blood coming from the mouth. The patient is catheterized and tea-colored urine is drained. Urinalysis shows:
Urine
pH 5.8
Specific gravity 1.045
Blood 3+
Glucose 3+
Proteins 1+
Ketones 1+
RBC none
WBC 0-1/hpf
Urine toxicology is positive for opiates and cocaine. Intravenous fluids and sodium nitroprusside drip are started. The patient is most likely to have which of the following?""",E,"The correct answer is E. Elevated serum creatine kinase.

The patient's presentation and laboratory results suggest rhabdomyolysis, a condition characterized by muscle cell damage and release of intracellular contents, including creatine kinase, into the bloodstream. The contusions on the patient's forehead, legs, and back, along with the tea-colored urine, are indicative of muscle damage. The urinalysis results, particularly the presence of blood (hemoglobin) and myoglobin, support this diagnosis.

Rhabdomyolysis can be caused by various factors, including trauma, muscle compression, and drug use. In this case, the patient's history of opiate and cocaine use, as well as the physical findings, suggest that drug-induced rhabdomyolysis is a likely cause.

Elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) is a hallmark of rhabdomyolysis, as CK is an enzyme released from damaged muscle cells. The other options are not directly related to the patient's presentation and laboratory results:

A. Low serum potassium: While hypokalemia can occur in rhabdomyolysis, it is not a direct consequence of muscle damage.

B. Low serum lactate dehydrogenase: LDH is an enzyme that can be elevated in various conditions, including muscle damage, but it is not as specific a marker for rhabdomyolysis as CK.

C. Low blood urea nitrogen: BUN is a marker of kidney function, and while rhabdomyolysis can cause acute kidney injury, a low BUN is not a characteristic finding.

D. Elevated serum calcium: Hypercalcemia is not typically associated with rhabdomyolysis.

Therefore, the most likely laboratory finding in this patient is an elevated serum creatine kinase level.",Success
"A 30-year-old G4P3 woman at 38 weeks gestation is admitted to the labor and delivery unit complaining of contractions every 5 minutes for the past hour. Her previous births have been via uncomplicated caesarean sections, but she wishes to attempt vaginal delivery this time. Her prenatal care is notable for gestational diabetes controlled with diet and exercise. The delivery is prolonged, but the patient's pain is controlled with epidural analgesia. She delivers a male infant with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Fundal massage is performed, but the placenta does not pass. The obstetrician manually removes the placenta, but a red mass protrudes through the vagina attached to the placenta. The patient loses 500 mL of blood over the next minute, during which her blood pressure decreases from 120/80 mmHg to 90/65 mmHg. What is the best next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Elevate posterior fornix.

The scenario describes a patient with a retained placenta that was manually removed, revealing a red mass protruding through the vagina attached to the placenta, which is likely a placenta accreta or placenta increta. This is a life-threatening condition where the placenta abnormally invades the uterine wall, leading to massive bleeding.

The best next step in management is to elevate the posterior fornix (Option D) to help control the bleeding. This maneuver can help compress the bleeding vessels and reduce blood loss. Additionally, the obstetrician may also consider other measures such as uterine tamponade, compression sutures, or interventional radiology procedures to control the bleeding.

Uterine artery ligation (Option A) may be considered in some cases, but it is not the best initial step in this scenario. Hysterectomy (Option B) may ultimately be necessary, but it should be considered a last resort after other measures have been attempted to control the bleeding.

Intravenous oxytocin (Option C) is not indicated in this scenario, as it can actually worsen the bleeding by increasing uterine contractions.

Red blood cell transfusion (Option E) may be necessary to address the patient's blood loss, but it is not the best next step in management. The priority should be to control the bleeding and stabilize the patient's hemodynamic status before considering transfusion.

It's essential to note that the management of placenta accreta or increta requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving obstetricians, anesthesiologists, and interventional radiologists. The goal is to control bleeding, stabilize the patient, and consider further interventions as needed.",Success

Transabdominal ultrasonography shows a mildly enlarged, diffusely hyperechoic liver. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these liver abnormalities?""",C,"The correct answer is C. Insulin resistance.

Justification:

The patient's laboratory results and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The key indicators are:

1. Elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) with a ratio of ALT:AST > 1, which is consistent with NAFLD.
2. Mildly enlarged and diffusely hyperechoic liver on ultrasonography, indicating fatty infiltration.
3. The patient's body mass index (BMI) of 36.3 kg/m2, which is classified as obese, is a strong risk factor for NAFLD.
4. The patient's hemoglobin A1c level of 6.3% suggests insulin resistance, which is a common underlying mechanism of NAFLD.

The other options can be excluded based on the following:

A. Autoimmune liver damage: The patient's antinuclear antibody titers are only mildly elevated (1:20), and smooth muscle antibody titers are negative, making autoimmune liver disease less likely.

B. Congestive hepatopathy: There is no evidence of heart failure or cardiac disease in the patient's history or physical examination.

D. Acetaminophen use: While the patient takes acetaminophen occasionally, the dose and frequency are not sufficient to cause liver damage.

E. Alcohol use: The patient's alcohol consumption is moderate (1-2 glasses of wine, 2-3 times a week), which is unlikely to cause significant liver damage.

Insulin resistance is a key underlying mechanism of NAFLD, and the patient's metabolic profile and liver enzyme abnormalities are consistent with this diagnosis.",Success
"A 16-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance from a soccer game. During the game, he was about to kick the ball when another player collided with his leg from the front. He was unable to stand up after this collision and reported severe knee pain. On presentation, he was found to have a mild knee effusion. Physical exam showed that his knee could be pushed posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion but it could not be pulled anteriorly in the same position. The anatomic structure that was most likely injured in this patient has which of the following characteristics?",E,"The correct answer is C. Runs medially from the lateral femoral condyle.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury. The PCL is one of the four major ligaments in the knee joint, and it prevents posterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur.

The posterior drawer test, which is described in the question, is a clinical test used to assess PCL integrity. In this test, the knee is flexed to 90 degrees, and the tibia is pushed posteriorly. If the PCL is intact, the tibia will not move posteriorly. If the PCL is injured, the tibia will move posteriorly, indicating a positive posterior drawer test.

The PCL originates from the lateral femoral condyle and runs medially to insert on the posterior aspect of the tibia. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) runs anteriorly from the medial femoral condyle, not the lateral femoral condyle.

B. The ACL also runs anteriorly, but from the medial femoral condyle, not the lateral femoral condyle.

D. The PCL does not run posteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle; it runs medially.

E. The PCL does not run posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle; it runs medially from the lateral femoral condyle.

"A 64-year-old male with a past medical history of two myocardial infarctions presents to the emergency room with shortness of breath. He notes that he stopped taking his furosemide two weeks prior, because he ran out of pills. On exam, his oxygen saturation is 78%, his lungs have crackles throughout, and jugular venous pulsation is located at the earlobe. EKG and troponin levels are normal. Which of the following is consistent with this man's pulmonary physiology?",E,"The correct answer is D. Increased Aa gradient, normal surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance.

Here's why:

The patient presents with shortness of breath, crackles in the lungs, and jugular venous distension, which are all consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). The fact that he stopped taking his furosemide (a diuretic) two weeks prior suggests that he has developed fluid overload, leading to pulmonary edema.

In pulmonary edema, the alveoli become flooded with fluid, which increases the diffusion distance between the alveoli and the capillaries. This impairs gas exchange, leading to hypoxia and an increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (Aa gradient).

The surface area for diffusion remains normal, as the alveoli themselves are not damaged. However, the increased fluid in the alveoli increases the distance that oxygen must diffuse to reach the capillaries, leading to impaired gas exchange.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Increased Aa gradient, normal surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Normal Aa gradient would not be consistent with the patient's symptoms and hypoxia.

B. Decreased Aa gradient would also not be consistent with the patient's symptoms and hypoxia.

C. Increased surface area for diffusion would not be expected in pulmonary edema, as the alveoli are flooded with fluid, not enlarged or increased in number.

E. Decreased surface area for diffusion would be expected in conditions such as emphysema, not pulmonary edema.",Success

Further evaluation revealed parasitemia and a few schistocytes, poikilocytes, and merozoites in tetrad formation. The findings are most consistent with which diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Babesiosis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and peripheral blood smear findings are consistent with Babesiosis. The key features that support this diagnosis are:

1. Travel history: The patient traveled to the Netherlands, which is an endemic area for Babesia.
2. Hematological findings: The patient has anemia (Hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, Hematocrit 29%), thrombocytopenia (Platelet count 60,000/mm3), and leukopenia (Leukocyte count 2,950/mm3), which are common in Babesiosis.
3. Peripheral blood smear: The presence of basophilic ring- and pear-shaped structures inside many red cells and extracellular basophilic rings on Wright-Giemsa staining is characteristic of Babesia parasites.
4. Parasitemia: The presence of parasitemia, schistocytes, poikilocytes, and merozoites in tetrad formation further supports the diagnosis of Babesiosis.

Malaria (Option A) can be ruled out because the peripheral blood smear findings are not consistent with Plasmodium parasites, which typically appear as ring-shaped or banana-shaped structures.

Anaplasmosis (Option C) is unlikely, as it typically presents with a more subtle hematological picture, and the peripheral blood smear findings are not consistent with Anaplasma parasites.

Tuberculosis (Option D) is not a parasitic infection and does not fit the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Lyme disease (Option E) is also unlikely, as it typically presents with a characteristic rash (erythema migrans) and does not typically cause the hematological abnormalities seen in this patient.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and peripheral blood smear findings, the most likely diagnosis is Babesiosis.",Success
"A 41-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath that is worse when she lies on her left side. About 10 days ago, she had an episode of unexplained loss of consciousness. Past medical history is negative and family history is irrelevant. Clinical examination shows a diastolic murmur, which is prominent when she lies on her left side. Jugular venous distention is present, and chest examination reveals fine crackles that do not clear with coughing. Chest X-ray shows pulmonary congestion, and 2-dimensional echocardiogram shows a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Atrial myxoma.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath and diastolic murmur, are consistent with a cardiac condition.
* The fact that the murmur is more prominent when she lies on her left side suggests that the lesion is in the left atrium, which is supported by the 2-dimensional echocardiogram finding of a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum.
* Atrial myxoma is a benign tumor that typically arises from the atrial septum and can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and syncope (loss of consciousness). The tumor can also cause a diastolic murmur due to obstruction of the mitral valve.
* The presence of pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray and fine crackles on chest examination that do not clear with coughing are also consistent with atrial myxoma, which can cause pulmonary edema and congestion due to left atrial obstruction.

The other options are not as likely:

* A. Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that can cause cardiac manifestations, but it is typically associated with a history of streptococcal infection and would not typically present with a mass in the left atrium.
* B. Innocent murmur is a benign heart murmur that is not associated with any underlying cardiac condition, and would not cause symptoms such as shortness of breath and syncope.
* C. Subacute infective endocarditis is an infection of the heart valves, which would not typically present with a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum.
* D. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis is a condition characterized by the formation of blood clots on the heart valves, but it would not typically present with a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum.

Overall, the combination of symptoms and echocardiogram findings make atrial myxoma the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 25-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck for the past week. He reports no recent fevers, night sweats, or weight loss.

His temperature is 36.8℃ (98.2℉). On physical examination, multiple non-tender lymph nodes, averaging 2 cm in diameter, are found to be palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. No other lymphadenopathy is noted. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show the following:
Hemoglobin 14 g/dL
Leukocyte count 8000/mm3 with a normal differential
Platelet count 250,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 40 mm/h
An excisional biopsy of one of the cervical lymph nodes is performed. The histopathologic analysis is shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL).

The histopathologic image shows a characteristic feature of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, which is the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells (large, binucleated or multinucleated cells with prominent nucleoli). These cells are a hallmark of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.

The patient's presentation with painless swelling of the neck, multiple non-tender lymph nodes, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is consistent with lymphoma. The lack of fever, night sweats, and weight loss reduces the likelihood of other causes of lymphadenopathy, such as infection or inflammatory disorders.

Option A, acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), is unlikely because the patient's complete blood count (CBC) shows a normal differential, and ALL typically presents with blasts in the peripheral blood.

Option C, HIV lymphadenopathy, is possible, but the histopathologic findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. HIV lymphadenopathy typically shows reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, which is a non-specific finding.

Option D, mononucleosis, is unlikely because the patient's presentation is not consistent with infectious mononucleosis, which typically presents with fever, sore throat, and fatigue.

Option E, phenytoin-induced adenopathy, is unlikely because the patient's lymphadenopathy is bilateral and involves multiple lymph node groups, which is not typical of a medication-induced reaction.

In summary, the histopathologic findings and the patient's presentation are consistent with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, making option B the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 67-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for urinary incontinence. She has been waking up every morning with her underwear soaked in urine.

Her current medications include lisinopril, metformin, insulin, aspirin, atorvastatin, sodium docusate, and loratadine. Her temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 167/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities and a systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?",A,"The correct answer is D. Oxybutynin and scheduled bathroom breaks.

The patient is experiencing urinary incontinence, specifically nocturnal enuresis (waking up with soaked underwear) and urge incontinence (leaking urine during the day if she doesn't take regular bathroom breaks). She also has frequency (urinating 5-11 times a day) and reports small volumes. This symptom complex suggests overactive bladder (OAB) with urinary incontinence.

The patient's medications do not appear to be contributing to her symptoms. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, can cause cough, but not urinary incontinence. Metformin, insulin, atorvastatin, sodium docusate, and loratadine are not known to cause urinary incontinence.

The physical exam findings of decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities suggest possible diabetic neuropathy, but this is not directly related to her urinary incontinence. The systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border is likely a benign finding.

The best treatment for this patient is oxybutynin, an anticholinergic medication that can help relax the bladder muscle and reduce urinary frequency and incontinence. Scheduled bathroom breaks can also help manage symptoms by reducing the amount of urine in the bladder and decreasing the likelihood of accidents.

Bethanechol (options A and B) is a cholinergic medication that can increase bladder contraction and is not typically used to treat OAB or urinary incontinence. Option C is incorrect because the patient does require treatment for her symptoms. Option E is also incorrect because reducing fluid intake may not address the underlying issue of OAB, and the patient is not taking diuretics.

The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of OAB recommend anticholinergic medications, such as oxybutynin, as a first-line treatment for OAB with urinary incontinence.

Which of the following is the next step in this patient’s management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Echocardiogram.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath (dyspnea) on exertion, orthopnea (difficulty breathing when lying down), and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (waking up at night with shortness of breath), are consistent with heart failure. The patient's history of myocardial infarction (heart attack) 5 years ago and continued alcohol consumption despite medical advice suggest that he may have developed left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure.

Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, the next step in management would be to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and structure. An echocardiogram is a non-invasive imaging test that uses ultrasound to assess the heart's structure and function, including the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), which is a key indicator of heart failure.

An echocardiogram would help to:

1. Confirm the diagnosis of heart failure
2. Assess the severity of left ventricular dysfunction
3. Identify any valvular abnormalities or other structural heart disease

The other options are not the next step in management for this patient:

A. Angiography is an invasive test that is typically used to diagnose coronary artery disease, which is not the primary concern in this patient.

B. Computed Tomography (CT) scan may be used to evaluate the lungs or other structures, but it is not the best test to evaluate cardiac function.

D. Stress test may be used to evaluate the patient's exercise tolerance and cardiac function, but it is not as sensitive or specific as an echocardiogram for evaluating left ventricular function.

E. Cardiac biopsy is an invasive test that is typically used to diagnose specific conditions such as cardiac amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, which are not suspected in this patient.

Therefore, an echocardiogram is the next step in this patient's management to evaluate his cardiac function and structure.",Success

He is found to have a nonradiating continuous machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border. S1 and S2 are normal. The peripheral pulses are bounding. Assuming this patient has no other cardiovascular defects, what is the most appropriate treatment?",A,"The correct answer is A. Indomethacin.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The continuous machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border, bounding peripheral pulses, and normal S1 and S2 sounds are all characteristic of a PDA. 

In a premature infant, a PDA can lead to complications such as heart failure, pulmonary edema, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is the treatment of choice for closing a PDA in premature infants. It works by inhibiting prostaglandin production, which helps to constrict the ductus arteriosus.

Thiazide diuretics (option B) are not typically used to treat a PDA. Aspirin (option C) is sometimes used in adults with a PDA, but it is not the first-line treatment for premature infants. Penicillin (option D) is an antibiotic and is not relevant to the treatment of a PDA. Reassurance (option E) may be appropriate if the PDA is small and not causing any symptoms, but in this case, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that treatment is necessary.

Boys are more commonly affected than girls.

The patient's symptoms, such as difficulty understanding social cues, intense focus on a specific interest (marine biology), and concrete thought process, are consistent with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors.

Option A is correct because ASD is indeed more common in boys than girls. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the prevalence of ASD is approximately 1 in 54 boys and 1 in 252 girls.

Option B is incorrect because while attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often comorbid with ASD, impaired attention is not a key feature of ASD.

Option C is incorrect because intellectual disability is not a key feature of ASD, although some individuals with ASD may have co-occurring intellectual disability.

Option D is incorrect because ASD is not typically associated with a family history of schizophrenia. While there may be some genetic overlap between the two conditions, they are distinct neurodevelopmental disorders with different underlying etiologies.

Sterilization with which of the following agents is most likely to prevent transmission of this pathogen to the next patient who will occupy her room?",A,"The correct answer is A. Chlorine-based solution.

The patient's symptoms and the growth of gram-positive, anaerobic rods in stool cultures are consistent with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), a common hospital-acquired infection. C. difficile is a spore-forming bacterium that can survive on surfaces for extended periods, making it a significant challenge for infection control.

To prevent transmission of C. difficile to the next patient, the room requires thorough cleaning and disinfection. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), a chlorine-based solution (such as bleach) is the most effective agent for sterilizing surfaces contaminated with C. difficile spores.

Chlorine-based solutions have been shown to be effective against C. difficile spores, whereas other agents may not be as effective. Chlorhexidine-based solutions (option B) are not sporicidal and may not be effective against C. difficile. Iodine-based solutions (option C) can be effective against some bacteria and viruses, but their efficacy against C. difficile spores is limited. Isopropanol-based solutions (option D) are not effective against bacterial spores.

Her mother has one brother that occasionally requires blood transfusions. Today, her blood pressure is 55/33 mm Hg, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, and temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the infant is irritated. She is slightly jaundiced. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her blood work shows normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin. Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies are also ruled out. A Coombs test is negative. Red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal. The physician determined that these findings are related to an enzyme deficiency. Which of the following allosterically inhibits this enzyme?",A,"The correct answer is C. Adenosine monophosphate.

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, it appears that the infant has a diagnosis of Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS), a genetic disorder characterized by an enzyme deficiency in the red blood cell membrane. The enzyme deficient in HS is Pyruvate Kinase (PK), which is involved in the glycolytic pathway.

Pyruvate Kinase is allosterically inhibited by Adenosine Monophosphate (AMP). When AMP binds to PK, it reduces the enzyme's activity, thereby decreasing the production of ATP and 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) in red blood cells. This inhibition is a normal regulatory mechanism to prevent excessive ATP production when energy levels are high.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Alanine is an amino acid that is not directly related to the regulation of Pyruvate Kinase.

B. Adenosine Diphosphate (ADP) is an allosteric activator of Pyruvate Kinase, not an inhibitor.

D. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is an intermediate in the glycolytic pathway, but it does not directly regulate Pyruvate Kinase.

E. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is an allosteric inhibitor of Phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK-1), another enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, but it does not inhibit Pyruvate Kinase.

It's essential to note that Hereditary Spherocytosis is typically diagnosed with a combination of clinical features, laboratory results, and genetic testing.

Abdominal exam shows mild diffuse tenderness to palpation and normal bowel sounds. The patient’s height, weight, and head circumference are normal. Laboratory results are as follows:
Hemoglobin 7 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 72
Lead level (capillary blood) 15 mcg/dL
Lead level (venous blood) 60 mcg/dL
Findings on a peripheral blood smear are shown in the image. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), also known as succimer.

This patient presents with symptoms of abdominal cramps, muscle pains, and fatigue, which are consistent with lead poisoning. The laboratory results confirm the diagnosis:

* Hemoglobin level of 7 g/dL indicates anemia, which is a common finding in lead poisoning.
* Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 72 suggests microcytic anemia, also consistent with lead poisoning.
* Lead levels in both capillary and venous blood are elevated, with the venous blood level being significantly higher (60 mcg/dL). This indicates a high level of lead exposure.
* The peripheral blood smear shows basophilic stippling, which is a characteristic finding in lead poisoning.

Given the patient's age and symptoms, treatment is necessary to remove lead from the body. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend chelation therapy for children with blood lead levels ≥45 mcg/dL.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), also known as succimer, is an oral chelating agent that is specifically recommended for children with lead poisoning. It is effective in reducing blood lead levels and is generally well-tolerated.

The other options are not the best treatment choices for this patient:

* Trientine (A) is a chelating agent used to treat Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder of copper metabolism.
* Calcium disodium edetate (B) is an intravenous chelating agent that can be used for lead poisoning, but it is not the first-line treatment for children.
* Dimercaprol (C) is an injectable chelating agent that can be used in combination with EDTA for severe lead poisoning, but it is not recommended as a single agent for children.
* Penicillamine (D) is a chelating agent used to treat copper toxicity, not lead poisoning.

Therefore, the best treatment option for this patient is dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), also known as succimer.",Success
"A 39-year-old woman with poorly controlled systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents to her rheumatologist for a follow-up visit. She has had intermittent myalgias, arthralgias, fatigue, and skin rashes over the past 10 years that have acutely worsened over the past year. She works as a school teacher but reports that she has had to miss several days of work due to her symptoms. She has been on hydroxychloroquine for several years but does not feel that it is adequately controlling her symptoms. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, she is well-appearing and in no acute distress. She has erythematous, raised plaques with keratotic scaling and follicular plugging on her hands. The physician decides to trial the patient on low-dose prednisone to better control her symptoms. At 2 months of follow-up, she reports that her flares have subsided and she has been able to return to work full-time. If this patient continues this medication regimen, she will be at an elevated risk for developing which of the following?",A,"The correct answer is A. Femoral neck fracture.

The patient is being treated with low-dose prednisone, a corticosteroid, to control her symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). While prednisone can be effective in reducing inflammation and improving symptoms, long-term use can lead to several adverse effects, including osteoporosis. Osteoporosis increases the risk of fractures, particularly in the spine, hip, and wrist.

Femoral neck fractures are a common type of hip fracture that can occur in individuals with osteoporosis. Corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis is a well-documented complication of long-term glucocorticoid use, including prednisone. The risk of osteoporosis and fractures increases with higher doses and longer duration of corticosteroid use.

The other options are not directly related to the use of prednisone or osteoporosis:

B. Femoral shaft fractures are less common than femoral neck fractures and are not specifically associated with corticosteroid use.

C. Meniscal tears are a type of knee injury that can occur due to various reasons, including trauma or degenerative changes, but are not related to prednisone use.

D. Osgood-Schlatter disease is a condition that affects the knee in adolescents, characterized by inflammation of the tendon below the kneecap. It is not related to prednisone use or osteoporosis.

E. Proximal phalanx fractures are a type of hand fracture that can occur due to various reasons, including trauma, but are not specifically associated with corticosteroid use or osteoporosis.

It is essential for the healthcare provider to monitor the patient's bone density and consider preventive measures, such as calcium and vitamin D supplements, to minimize the risk of osteoporosis and fractures while she continues to take prednisone.",Success
"A 40-year-old woman presents with severe shortness of breath. The patient is unable to provide a history due to her breathing difficulties. The patient’s roommate says that she came home and found her in this state. She also says that they both occasionally take sleeping pills to help them fall asleep. Physical examination reveals an obese female, dyspneic with diminished chest wall movements. The patient’s A-a gradient is calculated to be 10 mm Hg. Which of the following most likely accounts for this patient’s symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Alveolar hypoventilation.

Here's why:

The patient presents with severe shortness of breath, and the physical examination reveals diminished chest wall movements, suggesting respiratory muscle weakness or fatigue. The A-a gradient (alveolar-arterial gradient) is calculated to be 10 mm Hg, which is within normal limits. A normal A-a gradient indicates that the patient's oxygenation is not impaired due to diffusion defects or right-to-left shunts.

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely explanation is alveolar hypoventilation. This means that the patient is not taking in enough oxygen or expelling enough carbon dioxide, leading to respiratory acidosis. The patient's obesity and possible use of sleeping pills (which can cause respiratory depression) contribute to the likelihood of alveolar hypoventilation.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:

A. Alveolar hypoperfusion would result in a widened A-a gradient, which is not seen in this patient.

C. Impaired gas diffusion would also result in a widened A-a gradient, which is not consistent with the patient's normal A-a gradient.

D. Left-to-right blood shunt is not a plausible explanation, as it would not cause the patient's symptoms and would not be consistent with a normal A-a gradient.

E. Right-to-left blood shunt would result in a widened A-a gradient and is not supported by the patient's normal A-a gradient.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, combined with a normal A-a gradient, point to alveolar hypoventilation as the most likely explanation for her symptoms.",Success
"A 74-year-old woman is brought to her primary care doctor by her adult son. The son says she has been very difficult at home and is ""losing it"". He seems very frustrated about her diminishing ability to take care of herself the way she used to and no longer thinks he can trust her watching his children. At her last visit you noted mild cognitive impairment. Today, she appears withdrawn and hesitates to make eye-contact with you. She lets her son do most of the talking. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",E,"The correct answer is E. Ask the son to step out so you can speak with the patient alone.

This patient's presentation suggests a potential diagnosis of dementia, and the son's concerns about her ability to care for herself and watch his children are valid. However, it's essential to prioritize the patient's autonomy and assess her mental status without the influence of her son.

Asking the son to step out allows the healthcare provider to:

1. Establish a rapport with the patient and build trust.
2. Assess the patient's cognitive function and mental status without distraction or influence.
3. Evaluate the patient's ability to express her thoughts, feelings, and concerns.
4. Identify any potential signs of depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues.

While discussing the challenges of having a parent with dementia with the son (Option A) may be important, it should not be the initial step. Completing a mini-mental exam (Option B) is also important, but it should be done after establishing a rapport with the patient and assessing her mental status. Assessing the patient's risk for depression (Option C) is crucial, but it should be done in conjunction with speaking with the patient alone. Ordering a head CT (Option D) may be necessary, but it's not the most appropriate next step in this scenario.

By speaking with the patient alone, the healthcare provider can gather more accurate information, establish a better understanding of the patient's needs, and develop a more effective plan to address her cognitive and emotional challenges.",Success
"An investigator is studying the effects of different gastrointestinal regulatory substances. A healthy subject is asked to eat a meal at hour 0, and the pH of stomach contents and rate of stomach acid secretions are measured over the next 4 hours. Results of the study are shown. Which of the following mechanisms most likely contributes to the changes seen at point D in the graph?",B,"The correct answer is B. Increased activity of D cells.

Let's break down the graph and the options:

The graph shows the pH of stomach contents and the rate of stomach acid secretions over 4 hours after a meal. The pH of stomach contents decreases (becomes more acidic) and the rate of stomach acid secretions increases after the meal, which is a normal response to food stimulation.

At point D, around 2-3 hours after the meal, the pH of stomach contents starts to increase (becomes less acidic), and the rate of stomach acid secretions decreases. This suggests that there is an inhibitory mechanism that slows down gastric acid secretion and increases the pH of stomach contents.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A. Increased vagal stimulation would increase gastric acid secretion, not decrease it.

C. Increased activation of H2 receptors would also increase gastric acid secretion, not decrease it.

D. Increased activity of enterochromaffin-like cells would increase histamine release, which would stimulate gastric acid secretion, not decrease it.

E. Increased activity of I cells would increase cholecystokinin (CCK) release, which would stimulate pancreatic enzyme secretion and gallbladder contraction, but not directly affect gastric acid secretion.

B. Increased activity of D cells is the correct answer. D cells produce somatostatin, a hormone that inhibits gastric acid secretion and increases the pH of stomach contents. Somatostatin is released in response to a meal and helps to regulate gastric acid secretion and prevent excessive acid production. The increase in pH and decrease in gastric acid secretion at point D are consistent with the inhibitory effects of somatostatin released from D cells.",Success
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician with a lump on her throat that has steadily increased in size over the past 5 months. She does not have difficulties swallowing, dyspnea, or changes in voice. Examination shows a 3-cm, hard swelling on the left side of her neck that moves with swallowing. There is no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Thyroid functions tests are within the reference range. Ultrasound of the neck shows an irregular, hypoechogenic mass in the left lobe of the thyroid. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is inconclusive. The surgeon and patient agree that the most appropriate next step is a diagnostic lobectomy and isthmectomy. Surgery shows a 3.5-cm gray tan thyroid tumor with invasion of surrounding blood vessels, including the veins. The specimen is sent for histopathological examination. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on microscopic examination of the mass?",B,"The correct answer is E. Orphan Annie nuclei.

Based on the patient's symptoms and the surgical findings, the most likely diagnosis is papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The presence of a hard, irregular mass in the thyroid gland, invasion of surrounding blood vessels, and the absence of lymph node involvement are all consistent with PTC.

On microscopic examination, PTC is characterized by the presence of Orphan Annie nuclei, which are a type of nuclear feature that appears as optically clear nuclei with a ground-glass appearance. This is a hallmark feature of PTC and is seen in the majority of cases.

The other options are not as likely:

A. Undifferentiated giant cells are more characteristic of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, a more aggressive and less common type of thyroid cancer.

B. Capsular invasion is a feature of follicular thyroid carcinoma, which is a different type of thyroid cancer.

C. Psammoma bodies are small, calcified structures that can be seen in PTC, but they are not as specific or diagnostic as Orphan Annie nuclei.

D. Infiltration of atypical lymphoid tissue is not a characteristic feature of PTC.

It's worth noting that the fine-needle aspiration biopsy was inconclusive, which is not uncommon in PTC. The diagnosis was ultimately made with a diagnostic lobectomy and isthmectomy, which is a common approach in cases where the biopsy is inconclusive.",Success
"A 53-year-old female patient comes to the physician’s office for her annual check-up visit. She has no complaints and her past medical history is notable for diabetes and hypertension. During this visit, the patient undergoes screening procedures per guidelines including a mammogram. On the screening mammogram a spiculated, irregular mass is found on the left breast. Further diagnostic mammography and biopsy reveal ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Which of the following is the most important factor in determining this patient’s prognosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Tumor stage.

The prognosis of breast cancer is primarily determined by the tumor stage, which takes into account the size of the tumor, lymph node involvement, and distant metastases. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system is widely used to classify breast cancer into different stages, ranging from Stage I (early stage) to Stage IV (advanced stage).

Tumor stage is a strong predictor of survival and recurrence rates in breast cancer patients. A higher tumor stage is associated with a poorer prognosis, as it indicates a more advanced disease with a higher likelihood of lymph node involvement and distant metastases.

While tumor grade (Option A) is an important factor in determining the aggressiveness of the tumor, it is not as strong a predictor of prognosis as tumor stage. Tumor grade refers to the degree of abnormality in the tumor cells and is usually classified as low, intermediate, or high grade.

Age (Option C) is also a factor in breast cancer prognosis, as older patients tend to have a poorer prognosis. However, age is not as important as tumor stage in determining prognosis.

The patient's history of diabetes (Option D) is not a significant factor in determining the prognosis of breast cancer.

The location of the tumor on the breast (Option E) may affect the surgical approach and cosmetic outcome, but it is not a major determinant of prognosis.

According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, tumor stage is a critical factor in determining the prognosis and treatment of breast cancer. Therefore, Option B, Tumor stage, is the most important factor in determining this patient's prognosis.",Success
"A 2-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her concerned father. He states that ever since her uncomplicated delivery she has failed to gain weight, has had chronic diarrhea, and has had multiple bacterial and viral infections. During the course of the workup, an absent thymic shadow is noted and a lymph node biopsy demonstrates the absence of germinal centers. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",C,"The correct answer is C. Adenosine deaminase deficiency.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including failure to gain weight, chronic diarrhea, and recurrent infections, are consistent with a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). The absence of a thymic shadow on a chest X-ray and the lack of germinal centers in the lymph node biopsy further support this diagnosis.

Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is a type of SCID that affects both B and T cell development. ADA is an enzyme necessary for the breakdown of toxic metabolites in lymphocytes. Without ADA, these metabolites accumulate and are toxic to lymphocytes, leading to their destruction and impaired immune function.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings:

A. Defect in WASP gene: This is associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections. While it affects the immune system, it does not typically present with the same severity of immunodeficiency as SCID.

B. Defect in ATM gene: This is associated with ataxia-telangiectasia, a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasias, and immunodeficiency. While it can cause immunodeficiency, it is not typically associated with the same severity of symptoms as SCID.

D. NADPH oxidase deficiency: This is associated with chronic granulomatous disease, a rare genetic disorder that affects the production of reactive oxygen species by phagocytic cells, leading to recurrent infections. While it can cause immunodeficiency, it is not typically associated with the same severity of symptoms as SCID.

E. Defect in BTK gene: This is associated with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, a rare genetic disorder characterized by the absence of B cells and agammaglobulinemia. While it affects the immune system, it does not typically present with the same severity of immunodeficiency as SCID.

"A 1-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his parents for a regular check-up. His weight, height, and head size were found to be in the lower percentile ranges on standard growth curves. His hair is tangled and has a dry, brittle texture. Genetic testing reveals that the patient has a connective tissue disorder caused by impaired copper absorption and transport. The patient’s disorder is caused by a mutation in which of the following genes?",A,"The correct answer is A. ATP7A.

The patient's symptoms, including growth retardation, brittle hair, and impaired copper absorption and transport, are consistent with Menkes disease, a rare X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7A gene. ATP7A encodes a copper-transporting ATPase that plays a crucial role in copper absorption and distribution in the body.

Menkes disease is characterized by impaired copper transport, leading to copper deficiency, which affects the structure and function of connective tissue, including hair, skin, and bone. The brittle, tangled hair is a hallmark feature of the disease.

The other options are not directly related to Menkes disease or copper transport disorders:

* COL1A2 (Option B) is associated with osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disorder affecting collagen production and bone fragility.
* COL5A1 (Option C) is associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a group of disorders affecting collagen production and connective tissue.
* FBN1 (Option D) is associated with Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder affecting the body's connective tissue.
* ATP7B (Option E) is associated with Wilson disease, a genetic disorder affecting copper metabolism, but it is not related to Menkes disease or impaired copper absorption and transport.

She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the breasts shows a secondary mound formed by the nipple and areola. Pubic hair is sparse and lightly pigmented. Abdominal examination shows bilateral firm, nontender inguinal masses. Pelvic examination shows a blind-ended vaginal pouch. Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Gonadectomy.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a rare genetic disorder where individuals with a 46,XY karyotype are resistant to the action of androgens, resulting in incomplete masculinization. The presence of bilateral inguinal masses, which are likely testes, and the absence of a uterus and ovaries on ultrasonography support this diagnosis.

Gonadectomy, or the surgical removal of the testes, is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition. This is because the testes are at risk of developing malignancy, particularly seminoma, and gonadectomy reduces this risk. Additionally, gonadectomy will help to reduce the production of androgens, which can cause virilization and further masculinization.

Spironolactone therapy (A) is an androgen receptor blocker, which may be used to treat conditions such as hirsutism or acne in individuals with androgen excess, but it is not the primary treatment for AIS.

Testosterone therapy (C) would not be appropriate for this patient, as it would exacerbate the virilization and masculinization caused by the androgens.

Vaginal dilatory therapy (D) may be used to help create a functional vagina in individuals with AIS, but it is not the primary treatment for this condition.

Prednisolone therapy (E) is a glucocorticoid that may be used to treat conditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, but it is not relevant to the treatment of AIS.

It's important to note that the management of AIS is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving endocrinologists, surgeons, and psychologists. The patient should be referred to a specialist center for further evaluation and management.",Success
"A 51-year-old man presents the emergency room with chest pain. He mentions that the pain started several hours ago and radiates to his left neck and shoulder. He also mentions that he has some difficulty in breathing. He says that he has had similar chest pains before, but nothing seemed to be wrong at that time.

The blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, respirations are 18/min, and the pulse is 110/min. He seems a little anxious. The physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities. An ECG shows slight changes in the leads. His physician talks to him about the benefits of taking low-dose aspirin daily. Which of the following would be a contraindication to the use of aspirin in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Gastritis.

The patient's physician is considering prescribing low-dose aspirin daily, likely for its antiplatelet effects to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. However, aspirin is known to irritate the stomach lining and increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Given the patient's 3-year history of gastritis, aspirin use may exacerbate this condition and lead to complications.

The other options are not contraindications to aspirin use:

A. ECG changes: While the ECG shows slight changes, this is not a contraindication to aspirin use. In fact, aspirin may be beneficial in reducing the risk of further cardiac events.

B. Hypercholesterolemia: Aspirin is not contraindicated in patients with high cholesterol. In fact, aspirin may be beneficial in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with hypercholesterolemia.

D. Increased pulse rate: An increased pulse rate is not a contraindication to aspirin use.

E. Age above 50 years: Aspirin is often recommended for patients above 50 years old to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, so this is not a contraindication.

She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 3 years ago and has since been on medication to assist with her pain and to slow down disease progression. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the respiratory rate is 15/min, the pulse is 107/min, and the blood pressure is 102/98 mm Hg. On examination, you notice thinning hair and mildly cool extremities with flattened nail beds. A complete blood count and iron studies are ordered. Which of the following is most likely to show up on her iron profile?",D,"The correct answer is A. Increased iron-binding capacity.

The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath, are consistent with anemia. The physical examination findings, including thinning hair, cool extremities, and flattened nail beds, also support this diagnosis. Given the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and the use of medications to manage the disease, it is likely that she has developed iron deficiency anemia.

Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by decreased iron stores, which lead to a decrease in hemoglobin production and red blood cell formation. As a result, the body's iron-binding capacity increases in an attempt to compensate for the lack of iron. This is reflected in the iron profile by an increase in total iron-binding capacity (TIBC).

The other options are not consistent with iron deficiency anemia:

B. Low ferritin levels would be expected, but the question asks about the iron profile, which includes TIBC, not ferritin levels.

C. Increased iron levels would be inconsistent with iron deficiency anemia.

D. Decreased iron-binding capacity would not be expected in iron deficiency anemia.

E. Normal iron-binding capacity would not be consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

According to the American Society of Hematology, iron deficiency anemia is characterized by an increase in TIBC, which is a measure of the body's ability to bind iron. Therefore, option A is the most likely result on the patient's iron profile.",Success

This patient presents with diarrhea, vomiting, headache, and blurry vision, which are concerning symptoms that could be related to digoxin toxicity. The patient's medication list includes digoxin, which is known to cause gastrointestinal symptoms, visual disturbances, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's potassium level is elevated at 5.2 mEq/L, which is also consistent with digoxin toxicity.

Measuring the serum digoxin concentration is the most appropriate next step in management to determine if the patient's symptoms are related to digoxin toxicity. This will help guide further treatment decisions, such as withholding digoxin, administering digoxin-specific Fab fragments, or providing supportive care.

The other options are not as relevant at this point:

A. Hemodialysis is not indicated for this patient, as her creatinine level is not severely elevated, and there is no evidence of uremic symptoms.

B. A CT scan of the abdomen may be useful in evaluating the patient's abdominal symptoms, but it is not the most pressing concern given the patient's symptoms and medication list.

C. A C. difficile toxin assay may be considered in the evaluation of diarrhea, but it is not the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms, given the presence of other concerning features such as headache and blurry vision.

Ultrasonography of the abdomen is shown below. During the ultrasound exam, the patient complains of tenderness when the probe presses down on her right upper quadrant. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her pain?",A,"The correct answer is A. Acute calculous cholecystitis.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, are consistent with acute cholecystitis.
* The physical examination findings, including tenderness over the right upper quadrant that is severe enough to make her stop breathing when deeply palpated (Murphy's sign), are also consistent with acute cholecystitis.
* The laboratory results show a mild elevation in liver enzymes (AST and ALT), which can be seen in acute cholecystitis due to inflammation of the gallbladder and surrounding liver tissue.
* The normal serum amylase and lipase levels rule out acute pancreatitis (option D).
* The ultrasound image shows a gallstone in the gallbladder, which is a common cause of acute calculous cholecystitis.
* The patient's complaint of tenderness when the probe presses down on her right upper quadrant during the ultrasound exam (sonographic Murphy's sign) further supports the diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis.

Acute acalculous cholecystitis (option B) is less likely, as it typically occurs in critically ill patients and is not associated with gallstones. Biliary colic (option C) is also less likely, as it is typically a milder condition that does not present with fever, leukocytosis, and Murphy's sign.

What is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is B. Muellerian agenesis.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The patient has normal breast development, axillary hair, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5, indicating normal estrogenization. This suggests that the patient has normal ovarian function.
2. The FSH level is within the normal range for the follicular phase, which further supports normal ovarian function.
3. The estradiol level is also within the normal range for the mid-follicular phase, indicating normal estrogen production.
4. The testosterone level is within the normal range, ruling out any significant androgen excess.
5. The patient's symptoms of mild intermittent lower abdominal pain for the past year may be related to the underlying diagnosis.
6. The patient's refusal to undergo a vaginal examination and the presence of normal breast development and pubic hair suggest that the patient may have a normal external genitalia.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Muellerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. This is a congenital anomaly characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the uterus and vagina, despite normal ovarian function and external genitalia. The patient's symptoms of lower abdominal pain may be related to the presence of a rudimentary uterus or other Müllerian remnants.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

A. Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is unlikely given the normal FSH and estradiol levels.

C. Hyperprolactinemia is not supported by the laboratory results, and the patient's symptoms do not suggest galactorrhea or other signs of hyperprolactinemia.

D. Turner syndrome is unlikely given the patient's normal breast development and pubic hair, as well as the absence of other characteristic features such as short stature, webbed neck, and cardiac anomalies.

E. Androgen insensitivity is unlikely given the normal testosterone level and the presence of normal breast development and pubic hair.

In conclusion, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Muellerian agenesis (MRKH syndrome).",Success
"A 62-year-old woman with a pancreatic insulinoma is being prepared for a laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor. After induction of general anesthesia, preparation of a sterile surgical field, and port placement, the surgeon needs to enter the space posterior to the stomach to access the pancreatic tumor. Which of the following ligaments must be cut in order to access this space?",B,"The correct answer is B. Gastrohepatic ligament.

To access the space posterior to the stomach and reach the pancreatic tumor, the surgeon needs to enter the lesser sac, which is a potential space between the stomach and the posterior abdominal wall. The gastrohepatic ligament, also known as the hepatogastric ligament, is a peritoneal fold that connects the stomach to the liver and forms the anterior boundary of the lesser sac.

To enter the lesser sac, the surgeon must incise the gastrohepatic ligament, which allows access to the space posterior to the stomach and the pancreatic tumor. The other options are not correct because:

A. Phrenoesophageal ligament: This ligament is located in the thorax and attaches the esophagus to the diaphragm. It is not related to the space posterior to the stomach.

C. Phrenicocolic ligament: This ligament is located in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen and attaches the diaphragm to the colon. It is not related to the space posterior to the stomach.

D. Ligamentum venosum: This ligament is a fibrous remnant of the ductus venosus, which is a fetal structure that connects the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava. It is not related to the space posterior to the stomach.

E. Falciform ligament: This ligament is a peritoneal fold that attaches the liver to the anterior abdominal wall. It is not related to the space posterior to the stomach.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Gastrohepatic ligament.",Success
"A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his wife for severe abdominal pain for the past 1 hour. He is unable to give more information about the nature of his pain. His wife says that he has peptic ulcer disease and is being treated with antacids without a good response. She adds that he vomited repeatedly  in the last couple of hours, his vomitus being brown/red in color. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), respiratory rate is 16/min, pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg. A physical exam reveals a tense abdomen with a board like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness. An erect abdominal x-ray is ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Perforated gastric peptic ulcer.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and a tense abdomen with board-like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness, are consistent with a perforated viscus, which is a surgical emergency.
* The presence of brown/red vomitus suggests upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which is a common complication of peptic ulcer disease.
* The erect abdominal x-ray is likely to show free air under the diaphragm, which is a hallmark sign of a perforated viscus.
* Among the options, a perforated gastric peptic ulcer is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's history of peptic ulcer disease and the presence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
* Duodenal peptic ulcer (Option A) is less likely, as it typically presents with epigastric pain that radiates to the back, and the symptoms are not as severe as those described in this scenario.
* Gastric peptic ulcer (Option B) is possible, but the presence of free air under the diaphragm on an erect abdominal x-ray would be more consistent with a perforated ulcer.
* Pancreatitis (Option C) is unlikely, as it typically presents with epigastric pain that radiates to the back, and the symptoms are not as severe as those described in this scenario.
* Choledocholithiasis (Option E) is unlikely, as it typically presents with right upper quadrant pain, and the symptoms are not consistent with those described in this scenario.

It's worth noting that the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with a surgical emergency, and immediate surgical consultation and intervention are likely necessary.",Success
"A 62-year-old man presents with episodes of palpitations for the past 3 weeks. He says that he has episodes where he feels his heart is ‘racing and pounding’, lasting 1–2 hours on average. Initially, he says the episodes would happen 1–2 times per week but now happen almost every day. This last episode has been constant for the past 2 days. He denies any seizure, loss of consciousness, dizziness, chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is significant for an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, status post intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with still some residual neurologic impairment, and long-standing gastroesophageal reflux secondary to a hiatal hernia, managed medically. The patient reports a 15-pack-year smoking history, but no alcohol or recreational drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. On physical examination, muscle strength in the lower extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right, along with sensory loss on the left, all of which is improved from his previous exam 3 weeks ago. There is a loss of the left half of the visual field bilaterally which is stable from the previous exam. Cardiac examination is significant for a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm. No rubs, thrills or murmurs. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan shows evidence of an area of infarction in the vicinity of the right anterior cerebral artery showing normal interval change with no evidence of new hemorrhage or expansion of the area of infarction. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed, which is shown in the exhibit (see image below). Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Begin warfarin and heparin.

Rationale:

The patient's ECG shows atrial fibrillation (AFib) with a rapid ventricular response, which is the likely cause of his palpitations. AFib is a major risk factor for stroke, and the patient has already had an ischemic stroke in the past. To prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), anticoagulation therapy is necessary.

According to the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines, anticoagulation with warfarin is recommended for patients with AFib and a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Warfarin is effective in reducing the risk of stroke in patients with AFib.

However, since the patient is currently in AFib with a rapid ventricular response, he needs to be bridged with heparin to prevent thrombus formation in the atria until the warfarin takes effect. Therefore, the most appropriate intervention is to begin warfarin and heparin.

Aspirin (Option A) is not sufficient for stroke prevention in this patient, as it is less effective than warfarin in preventing stroke in patients with AFib.

Clopidogrel (Option B) is an antiplatelet agent that is not indicated for stroke prevention in AFib.

Carotid endarterectomy (Option C) is a surgical procedure that is not relevant to this patient's current condition.

Beginning warfarin alone (Option E) would not provide immediate protection against thrombus formation, and bridging with heparin is necessary to prevent stroke.",Success
"In 2005, a group of researchers believed that prophylactically removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) in BRCA-mutation positive women would reduce the chance that they developed breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, they reviewed a database of women who were known to be BRCA-mutation positive and divided the group into those with breast cancer and those without breast cancer. They used data in the registry and surveys about peoples’ surgical history to compare the proportion of each population that had undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Based on this data, they reported that women undergoing the procedure had a lower chance of developing breast cancer later in life with an odds ratio of 0.46. This is an example of what type of study design?",D,"The correct answer is D. Case-control.

Here's why:

* The study design involves comparing two groups: women with breast cancer (cases) and women without breast cancer (controls).
* The researchers looked back at the data to identify whether the cases and controls had undergone bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
* The outcome of interest (breast cancer) had already occurred, and the researchers were investigating the potential association with the exposure (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy).
* The study design is retrospective, meaning the researchers are looking back at existing data, rather than prospectively collecting new data.

A case-control study is a type of observational study that compares the characteristics of individuals with a specific outcome (cases) to those without the outcome (controls) to identify potential risk factors or associations.

The other options are not correct because:

* A. Retrospective cohort study would involve following a group of people over time to observe the development of an outcome, which is not the case here.
* B. Meta-analysis is a type of study that combines the results of multiple studies to draw conclusions, which is not what was done here.
* C. Cross-sectional study would involve collecting data at a single point in time, which is not the case here, as the researchers looked back at existing data.
* E. Genome-wide association study is a type of study that examines the association between genetic variants and a specific outcome, which is not the focus of this study.",Success
"A 64-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus is referred to a urologist. The patient has had pain when urinating and difficulty starting a stream of urine for over 4 months now. He is bothered because he has to urinate about 9 times every day, including several times when he wakes up at night. A digital rectal examination revealed multiple hard nodules in the prostate gland. A CT scan shows a nodule in the right lung that measures 3 cm. An ultrasound scan of his urinary bladder and prostate shows residual urine of > 200 mL and heterogeneous findings of the prostate gland. Biopsy reveals grade 2 prostate adenocarcinoma. Follow-up 9 months later shows his prostate cancer is well controlled with goserelin. If one considers pulmonary nodules that are the same size as this patient’s, which of the following additional findings on CT scans would most likely prompt the removal of such nodules?",D,"The correct answer is E. Doubling time of < 1 month.

Here's why:

The patient has a 3 cm pulmonary nodule, which is a common finding in patients with prostate cancer. The key to determining whether the nodule is likely to be malignant is to assess its growth rate. A doubling time of less than 1 month is a strong indicator of malignancy, as it suggests rapid growth. This finding would prompt the removal of the nodule.

The other options are not as concerning:

A. Lamellated calcification is a benign feature, often seen in granulomas or hamartomas.

B. A 'popcorn' pattern is characteristic of a benign pulmonary hamartoma.

C. A subsolid component can be seen in both benign and malignant lesions, but it is not a specific indicator of malignancy.

D. Extending fine striations are often seen in benign lesions, such as pulmonary hamartomas or inflammatory lesions.

According to the Fleischner Society Guidelines for Management of Incidental Pulmonary Nodules Detected on CT Images, a doubling time of less than 1 month is a high-risk feature that warrants further evaluation and possible removal.

It's worth noting that the patient's prostate cancer is well-controlled with goserelin, which suggests that the pulmonary nodule may not be related to the prostate cancer. However, given the patient's age and medical history, it's essential to evaluate the pulmonary nodule further to determine its nature and potential impact on the patient's overall health.",Success
"A 35-year-old man presents with a 7 month history of insomnia. The patient admitted to having trouble sleeping from a young age but became more aware of how much this is affecting his health after attending a sleep conference earlier this year. He is worried that his health has suffered because of this, and he is also concerned that he will not be able to pay his bills if he were to get sick. He has no past medical or psychiatric condition and is not known to use any recreational drugs. The patient arrived for his appointment an hour early because he was afraid he might miss it. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals an irritable middle age man who is tense and somewhat inattentive during the interview. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
 ",A,"The correct answer is A. Generalized anxiety disorder.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and behavior are consistent with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). He presents with a 7-month history of insomnia, which is a common symptom of GAD. His excessive worry about his health and finances, as well as his fear of missing the appointment, suggest an excessive and persistent worry about everyday things, which is a hallmark of GAD.

The patient's physical examination findings, such as being irritable, tense, and somewhat inattentive, are also consistent with GAD. Additionally, the patient's behavior, such as arriving an hour early for the appointment, suggests an excessive concern about being on time, which is another common feature of GAD.

While adjustment disorder (option B) is a possibility, the patient's symptoms seem to be more persistent and excessive than what would be expected in an adjustment disorder. Social anxiety (option C) is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are not specifically related to social situations. Agoraphobia (option D) is not supported by the patient's symptoms, as there is no mention of fear or avoidance of places or situations. Normal worry (option E) is not a diagnosis, and the patient's symptoms are clearly excessive and interfering with his daily life.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), the diagnostic criteria for GAD include:

* Excessive anxiety and worry about everyday things, such as work, finances, or health, occurring more days than not for at least 6 months
* Difficulty controlling the worry
* Anxiety or worry that is associated with at least three of the following symptoms: restlessness, fatigue, concentration problems, irritability, muscle tension, or sleep disturbance
* The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.

The patient's symptoms and behavior meet these criteria, making GAD the most likely diagnosis.",Success
A 3-year-old girl is brought to the cardiologist because of sweating and respiratory distress while eating. She is at the 30th percentile for height and 15th percentile for weight. Echocardiography shows a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum and a moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. Physical examination is most likely to show which of the following findings?,A,"The correct answer is C. Systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and echocardiography results suggest a diagnosis of ventricular septal defect (VSD). VSD is a congenital heart defect characterized by a hole in the septum that separates the two ventricles of the heart.

The physical examination finding that is most likely to be present in a patient with VSD is a systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis (option C). This is because the murmur is caused by the flow of blood from the left ventricle to the right ventricle through the defect, and the increased pressure in the chest during forced exhalation (Valsalva maneuver) increases the flow of blood through the defect, making the murmur louder.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Systolic murmur that increases with hand clenching is more characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, not VSD.

B. Wide, fixed splitting of the second heart sound is typically seen in atrial septal defects, not VSD.

D. Diastolic murmur preceded by opening snap is characteristic of mitral stenosis, not VSD.

E. Continuous murmur that is loudest at the second heart sound is more characteristic of patent ductus arteriosus, not VSD.

It's worth noting that the patient's symptoms of sweating and respiratory distress while eating are likely due to congestive heart failure, which is a common complication of VSD. The patient's growth percentile is also consistent with VSD, as these patients may have difficulty gaining weight due to increased energy expenditure from the heart working harder to pump blood.",Success
"A 58-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath and a nonproductive cough for the last week. Three weeks ago, he had a fever and a cough for 6 days after he returned from a trip to Southeast Asia. He has had a 4-kg (9-lb) weight loss over the past 3 months. He has bronchial asthma and hypertension. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 41 years. Current medications include an albuterol inhaler and enalapril. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 136/89 mm Hg. There is dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and decreased tactile fremitus over the left lung base. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Chest x-ray of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?",E,"The correct answer is E. Blunting of costophrenic angle.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a pleural effusion, which is a collection of fluid in the space between the lungs and chest wall. The patient's dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and decreased tactile fremitus over the left lung base are all consistent with a pleural effusion.

On a chest x-ray, a pleural effusion would typically cause blunting of the costophrenic angle, which is the angle formed by the diaphragm and the chest wall. This is because the fluid accumulation in the pleural space pushes the lung away from the chest wall, causing the costophrenic angle to become less sharp.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Elevation of diaphragm would be seen in conditions such as phrenic nerve paralysis or diaphragmatic hernia, which are not suggested by the patient's symptoms.

B. Ground glass appearance is a radiological feature seen in conditions such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or interstitial lung disease, which are not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms.

C. Widened intercostal spaces would be seen in conditions such as emphysema or pneumothorax, which are not suggested by the patient's symptoms.

D. Deep sulcus sign is a radiological feature seen in pneumothorax, which is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms.

"A 58-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of sudden-onset right-sided body numbness for 1 hour. He reports that he has a 15-year history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. He is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. Neurological examination shows decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature on the right side of the face and body. Motor strength is 5/5 and deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Perfusion of which of the following structures of the brain is most likely impaired in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Ventral thalamus.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, specifically the sudden-onset right-sided body numbness, suggest a lesion in the somatosensory pathway. The neurological examination reveals decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature on the right side of the face and body, which is consistent with a lesion in the ventral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus of the thalamus.

The VPL nucleus is responsible for processing sensory information from the contralateral side of the body, including the face and body. A lesion in this area would result in numbness and impaired sensation on the opposite side of the body, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms.

The other options are not as likely:

A. Parietal lobe: While the parietal lobe is involved in processing sensory information, a lesion in this area would more likely result in cortical sensory deficits, such as astereognosis or agraphia, rather than the pure sensory deficit seen in this patient.

B. Posterior limb of the internal capsule: A lesion in the posterior limb of the internal capsule would result in a more extensive motor deficit, which is not seen in this patient.

C. Lateral medulla: A lesion in the lateral medulla, also known as Wallenberg's syndrome, would result in a distinct set of symptoms, including ipsilateral facial numbness, contralateral body numbness, and vertigo, which do not match the patient's presentation.

D. Basal pons: A lesion in the basal pons would result in a more extensive neurological deficit, including cranial nerve palsies and long-tract signs, which are not seen in this patient.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and neurological examination, the most likely structure impaired is the ventral thalamus, specifically the VPL nucleus.",Success
"A 9-year-old boy is brought in by his mother because of bruising on his torso and limbs. The patient’s mother denies any other symptoms and says he is otherwise healthy. Physical examination shows multiple petechiae and bruising on the torso and extremities bilaterally. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A complete blood count is normal. His coagulation profile reveals:
Prothrombin time (PT) 12 sec
Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 60 sec
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Von Willebrand disease.

Here's why:

The patient presents with bruising and petechiae, suggesting a bleeding disorder. The complete blood count (CBC) is normal, which rules out thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) as the cause of the bleeding. The coagulation profile shows a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 60 seconds, which indicates a defect in the intrinsic or common coagulation pathway.

Hemophilia A (option E) and Hemophilia B (option B) are both possibilities, but they typically present with a more severe bleeding phenotype, and the aPTT is usually more significantly prolonged (>100 seconds). Additionally, the prothrombin time (PT) is normal in this patient, which is unusual in hemophilia.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (option A) is unlikely, as the CBC is normal, and there is no mention of other symptoms such as fever, fatigue, or lymphadenopathy.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (option C) is also unlikely, as the CBC is normal, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a coagulation disorder rather than a platelet disorder.

Von Willebrand disease (option D) is the most likely diagnosis, as it is a bleeding disorder that affects the intrinsic coagulation pathway, causing a prolonged aPTT. The normal PT and normal platelet count are consistent with this diagnosis. Von Willebrand disease is a common cause of easy bruising and petechiae in children, and it can present with a mild to moderate bleeding phenotype.

In summary, the combination of a normal CBC, normal PT, and prolonged aPTT points towards a diagnosis of Von Willebrand disease.",Success
"A 31-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-week history of a painless lump near the left wrist and tingling pain over his left hand. Physical examination shows a transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist. There is decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand. The tingling pain is aggravated by tapping over the swelling. Which of the following adjacent structures is at risk of entrapment if this mass persists?",C,"The correct answer is D. Flexor carpi radialis tendon.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a ganglion cyst, a benign tumor-like lesion that arises from a joint capsule or tendon sheath. The location of the mass on the lateral volar aspect of the wrist, its transilluminating and rubbery texture, and the patient's symptoms of tingling pain and decreased sensation in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger are all characteristic of a ganglion cyst compressing the median nerve.

The flexor carpi radialis tendon is at risk of entrapment if the ganglion cyst persists because it runs adjacent to the median nerve and can be compressed by the cyst. The flexor carpi radialis tendon is responsible for flexion and radial deviation of the wrist, and compression can cause weakness and pain in the wrist and hand.

The other options are not directly related to the symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Ulnar artery: While the ulnar artery is nearby, it is not typically affected by a ganglion cyst in this location.

B. Extensor pollicis brevis tendon: This tendon is responsible for extension of the thumb and is not typically affected by a ganglion cyst in this location.

C. Flexor pollicis longus tendon: This tendon is responsible for flexion of the thumb and is not typically affected by a ganglion cyst in this location.

E. Ulnar nerve: The ulnar nerve is not typically affected by a ganglion cyst in this location, as it runs more medially in the wrist.

It's worth noting that the diagnosis of a ganglion cyst is often made clinically, but imaging studies such as ultrasound or MRI may be used to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.",Success
"A 52-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painless right-sided scrotal swelling. The swelling started several weeks ago but is not always present. Physical examination shows an 8-cm, soft, cystic nontender right-sided scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?",A,"The correct answer is A. Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by tunica vaginalis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a hydrocele, which is a fluid-filled sac surrounding the testicle. The key features that support this diagnosis are:

1. Painless, soft, and cystic mass: Hydroceles are typically painless and have a soft, cystic consistency.
2. Transillumination: The fact that the mass transilluminates suggests that it is filled with clear fluid, which is consistent with a hydrocele.
3. No increase in size on coughing: Hydroceles do not change size with increased intra-abdominal pressure, unlike hernias.
4. Normal tissue palpable above the mass: This suggests that the mass is confined to the scrotum and does not extend into the inguinal canal.
5. No bowel sounds: This rules out the presence of bowel contents in the mass, making a hernia less likely.

The most likely cause of a hydrocele is an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis, which is a layer of tissue that surrounds the testicle. This imbalance can lead to the accumulation of fluid in the space between the tunica vaginalis and the testicle, resulting in a hydrocele.

Option B is incorrect because a failure of the processus vaginalis to obliterate would result in a congenital indirect inguinal hernia, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Option C is also incorrect because the mass does not increase in size on coughing, and there are no bowel sounds, making a hernia less likely. Option D is incorrect because dilation and tortuosity of veins in the pampiniform plexus would result in a varicocele, which is a different condition. Option E is incorrect because primary germ cell neoplasia of the testicle would typically present as a solid mass, not a fluid-filled cystic mass.",Success
"A 40-year-old patient is brought into the emergency department after suffering a motor vehicle crash where he was pinned underneath his motorcycle for about 30 minutes before a passerby called 911. While evaluating him per your institution's trauma guidelines, you discover pain upon palpation of his right lower extremity which is much larger than his left counterpart. The patient admits to decreased sensation over his right lower extremity and cannot move his leg. There are no palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses on this extremity, and it is colder and paler in comparison to his left side. Measured compartment pressure of his distal right leg is 35 mm Hg. What is the next best step in this patient's care?",A,"The correct answer is A. Emergent fasciotomy.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with compartment syndrome, a medical emergency that requires prompt intervention. Compartment syndrome occurs when there is increased pressure within a confined anatomical space, leading to compression of blood vessels and nerves. In this case, the patient's right lower extremity is larger than the left, and he has pain, decreased sensation, and inability to move his leg, suggesting compression of nerves and blood vessels.

The measured compartment pressure of 35 mm Hg is also consistent with compartment syndrome. Normal compartment pressure is typically around 10-15 mm Hg. A pressure above 30 mm Hg is considered elevated and requires immediate attention.

Emergent fasciotomy is the next best step in this patient's care. Fasciotomy involves surgically releasing the fascia, the connective tissue that surrounds muscles, to relieve pressure and restore blood flow to the affected limb. This procedure is necessary to prevent further tissue damage, necrosis, and potential amputation.

While the other options may be relevant in the management of this patient, they are not the next best step:

B. Venous doppler: This test is used to evaluate blood flow in the veins, but it is not a priority in this scenario, where the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest compartment syndrome.

C. Arteriogram: This test is used to evaluate blood flow in the arteries, but it is not necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with compartment syndrome.

D. External fixation: This may be necessary later in the patient's care, but it is not the next best step. External fixation is used to stabilize fractures, but it does not address the underlying compartment syndrome.

E. Internal fixation: Like external fixation, internal fixation may be necessary later in the patient's care, but it is not the next best step. Internal fixation is used to stabilize fractures, but it does not address the underlying compartment syndrome.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with compartment syndrome, and emergent fasciotomy is the next best step in his care to relieve pressure and restore blood flow to the affected limb.",Success
An 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of fever and a pruritic rash that started on his trunk and then progressed to his face and extremities. He has not received any childhood vaccinations because his parents believe that they are dangerous. His temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F). A photograph of the rash is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,B,"The correct answer is B. Varicella.

The photograph of the rash, combined with the patient's symptoms and history, strongly suggest a diagnosis of varicella, also known as chickenpox. The rash is characteristic of varicella, with multiple, itchy, fluid-filled blisters that start on the trunk and spread to the face and extremities. The patient's age, fever, and lack of vaccination history also support this diagnosis.

Varicella is a highly contagious illness caused by the varicella-zoster virus, and it is typically seen in unvaccinated children. The rash typically starts as red spots that turn into blisters, which then crust over and scab. The patient's symptoms and rash are consistent with this description.

Option A, nonbullous impetigo, is unlikely because the rash is not limited to the skin and does not have the characteristic honey-colored crusts seen in impetigo.

Option C, herpes zoster, is also unlikely because it typically affects adults and presents as a unilateral, dermatomal rash, rather than a widespread rash.

Option D, rubella, is possible but less likely because the rash is typically more diffuse and not as itchy as the one described.

Option E, erythema infectiosum, is also possible but less likely because the rash is typically more localized and does not have the characteristic blisters seen in varicella.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend vaccination against varicella as part of the routine childhood immunization schedule. The lack of vaccination in this patient increases the risk of contracting varicella.",Success
"A 43-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after his son found him vomiting bright red blood. He is visibly intoxicated, and hospital records indicate a long history of alcohol substance abuse treated with antabuse (disulfiram). Vital signs include T 98.4, HR 89, BP 154/92, and RR 20. EGD is notable for mild esophagitis, and a longitudinal esophageal tear at the gastroesophageal junction, with no active bleeding. What is the next best course of action?",B,"The correct answer is B. Conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation.

Here's why:

The patient has a longitudinal esophageal tear at the gastroesophageal junction, but there is no active bleeding. This suggests that the tear is not actively bleeding and may not require immediate intervention. The patient's vital signs are stable, and there is no indication of hemodynamic instability.

Conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation is a reasonable approach in this scenario. The patient can be monitored for signs of bleeding or perforation, and IV fluids can help prevent dehydration.

Option A is incorrect because cyanoacrylate injection and ligation with banding are typically used to treat bleeding varices, which is not the case here. Additionally, NPO (nothing by mouth) status may not be necessary if the patient is not actively bleeding.

Option C is incorrect because a barium swallow is not necessary to characterize the depth of mucosal involvement in this scenario. The EGD has already provided a clear diagnosis of the esophageal tear.

Option D is incorrect because esophageal manometry and impedance studies are typically used to evaluate esophageal motility disorders, such as achalasia, which is not relevant to this patient's presentation.

Option E is incorrect because calcium channel blockers and Botox injection of the lower esophageal sphincter are used to treat achalasia, which is not the patient's diagnosis.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of alcohol abuse and treatment with disulfiram (Antabuse) may be relevant to his overall medical management, but it does not directly impact the decision on how to manage the esophageal tear.",Success
A medical student is preparing a patient for an appendectomy. He is asked by the surgeon to disinfect the patient’s skin with a chlorhexidine-isopropyl alcohol solution before the procedure. Recent studies have shown that this solution substantially reduces the risk of surgical site infections compared with a povidone-iodine preparation without alcohol in clean-contaminated surgery. Which of the following mechanisms best describes the mechanism of action of chlorhexidine?,E,"The correct answer is B. Protein coagulation/denaturation.

Chlorhexidine is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that is commonly used as a skin disinfectant and antiseptic. Its mechanism of action involves disrupting the bacterial cell membrane, leading to protein coagulation and denaturation. This ultimately causes the death of the bacterial cell.

Chlorhexidine works by binding to the negatively charged bacterial cell membrane, causing a disruption in the membrane's structure and function. This leads to the coagulation and denaturation of proteins, which is lethal to the bacterial cell. Chlorhexidine is effective against a wide range of microorganisms, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as some viruses and fungi.

The other options are not accurate descriptions of chlorhexidine's mechanism of action:

A. While chlorhexidine is bactericidal, its mechanism of action is not simply a matter of being bactericidal at low concentrations.

C. Chlorhexidine does not work by releasing free radicals, which are highly reactive molecules that can damage cells.

D. Chlorhexidine does not attack free-sulfur amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids within bacteria.

E. Chlorhexidine's activity is not significantly affected by pH, and while its activity may be reduced in the presence of organic matter, this is not its primary mechanism of action.

It's worth noting that the combination of chlorhexidine with isopropyl alcohol, as mentioned in the question, has been shown to be more effective than povidone-iodine in reducing surgical site infections. The isopropyl alcohol helps to enhance the penetration of chlorhexidine into the skin, making it a more effective disinfectant.",Success
"A 19-year-old man with a past medical history significant only for facial acne presents with increased inguinal pruritis. Relevant social history includes participation in school wrestling. He has no significant family history. Other than the pruritic rash, a review of systems is negative. On physical examination, there is an erythematous, well-demarcated patch on his left thigh, over his pubic region, and throughout the perineum. The scrotum is spared. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Tinea cruris.

Here's why:

* The patient presents with inguinal pruritis, which is a common symptom of tinea cruris, a fungal infection that affects the groin area.
* The physical examination reveals an erythematous, well-demarcated patch on the left thigh, pubic region, and perineum, which is consistent with the typical distribution of tinea cruris.
* The scrotum is spared, which is also consistent with tinea cruris, as it typically affects the surrounding skin but not the scrotum itself.
* The patient's history of participating in school wrestling increases the likelihood of tinea cruris, as it is a common infection among athletes who engage in close contact sports.
* The other options can be ruled out based on the physical examination findings:
	+ Tinea corporis (A) is a fungal infection that can affect any part of the body, but it typically presents with a ring-shaped lesion, which is not described in this scenario.
	+ Candidal balanitis (C) is a fungal infection that affects the glans penis, which is not mentioned in the physical examination findings.
	+ Pityriasis rosea (D) is a viral rash that typically presents with a herald patch on the trunk, followed by a diffuse rash on the arms and legs, which does not match the physical examination findings.
	+ Tinea unguium (E) is a fungal infection that affects the nails, which is not relevant to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

According to current medical guidelines, tinea cruris is a common fungal infection that affects the groin area, and it is often seen in athletes who engage in close contact sports. The diagnosis is typically made based on the physical examination findings and can be confirmed with a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation or fungal culture.",Success
"A 6-week-old girl is brought to the pediatrician for a post-natal visit. She was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 25-year-old woman via an uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery. The mother reports that prenatal screening revealed no developmental abnormalities and that the baby has been gaining weight, feeding, stooling, and urinating appropriately. Physical exam of the infant is unremarkable. The mother has a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and is curious about the development of her daughter's ovaries. Which of the following is true regarding the baby’s reproductive system at this time?",B,"The correct answer is B. The baby's oocytes are arrested in prophase.

Explanation:

At 6 weeks of age, the baby's reproductive system is still developing. During fetal development, oogenesis (the formation of oocytes) occurs in the ovaries. By around 12-14 weeks of gestation, the oogonia (primitive oocytes) have developed into primary oocytes, which then enter a state of arrested development in prophase I of meiosis. This is known as the diplotene stage.

At birth, the ovaries of a female infant contain around 1-2 million oocytes, all of which are arrested in prophase I of meiosis. These oocytes will remain in this state until puberty, when they will begin to mature and be released during ovulation.

Option A is incorrect because the baby has already developed oocytes during fetal development. Option C is incorrect because metaphase is a later stage of meiosis, and the oocytes are not yet at that stage. Option D is incorrect because interphase is a stage of the cell cycle that occurs between cell divisions, and it is not a stage of meiosis. Option E is incorrect because the oocytes are not yet fully matured; they will continue to develop and mature during puberty.

It's worth noting that the mother's history of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) may have implications for the baby's reproductive health later in life, but it does not affect the development of the baby's ovaries at this stage.",Success
"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-week history of burning sensation in his mouth. One year ago, a peripheral blood smear performed during workup of fatigue revealed erythrocytes without central pallor. His father had gallstones, for which he underwent a cholecystectomy at the age of 26 years. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes, mild scleral icterus, a swollen, red tongue, and several mouth ulcers. There is darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles. His spleen is enlarged and palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.1 gm/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 104 μm3, and a reticulocyte count of 9%. Which of the following would most likely have prevented this patient's oropharyngeal symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is E. Folic acid supplementation.

The patient's symptoms, including a burning sensation in the mouth, pallor, mild scleral icterus, a swollen and red tongue, and mouth ulcers, are consistent with a diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia. The peripheral blood smear showing erythrocytes without central pallor and the laboratory results, including a high mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and reticulocyte count, support this diagnosis.

The patient's family history of gallstones and the presence of darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles (Arbeitslinien) suggest a diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis. However, this condition is not directly related to the patient's oropharyngeal symptoms.

Megaloblastic anemia can be caused by a deficiency of either vitamin B12 or folate. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with a folate deficiency, which can cause oropharyngeal symptoms such as a burning sensation in the mouth, glossitis, and mouth ulcers. Folate deficiency can also cause megaloblastic anemia, which is supported by the laboratory results.

Folic acid supplementation would most likely have prevented the patient's oropharyngeal symptoms. Vitamin B12 injections (option D) may also be necessary to treat the patient's megaloblastic anemia, but they would not specifically prevent the oropharyngeal symptoms.

Pneumococcal vaccine and antibiotic prophylaxis (option A) are not related to the patient's oropharyngeal symptoms. Red blood cell transfusions (option B) may be necessary to treat the patient's anemia, but they would not prevent the oropharyngeal symptoms. A gluten-free diet (option C) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.",Success
An experimental new drug in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 was found to increase the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation at the endothelium. This further increased glucose-dependent insulin production. Which of the following drugs has a mechanism of action most similar to this new experimental drug?,B,"The correct answer is B. Sitagliptin.

The experimental new drug described in the question increases the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation at the endothelium, which leads to increased glucose-dependent insulin production. This mechanism of action is similar to that of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, such as sitagliptin.

DPP-4 inhibitors work by inhibiting the enzyme DPP-4, which breaks down incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP). By preventing the degradation of these incretins, DPP-4 inhibitors increase their levels, leading to increased glucose-dependent insulin secretion and improved glucose control.

Exenatide (Option A) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, which works by mimicking the action of GLP-1, but it does not prevent the degradation of incretins.

Glimepiride (Option C) is a sulfonylurea, which works by stimulating insulin secretion from the pancreas, but it does not affect incretin levels.

Canagliflozin (Option D) is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which works by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the kidneys, but it does not affect incretin levels.

Pioglitazone (Option E) is a thiazolidinedione, which works by improving insulin sensitivity, but it does not affect incretin levels.

Therefore, sitagliptin (Option B) is the drug with a mechanism of action most similar to the experimental new drug described in the question.",Success
"A 60-year-old man with severe persistent asthma since the age of 14 presents with an acute exacerbation of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing over the last several days. His asthmatic symptoms are usually well controlled with regular high-dose inhaled triamcinolone, but over the last week or so he has developed a nocturnal cough and mild wheezing despite good compliance with controller medications. A review of several spirometry reports suggest of bronchial asthma with a partial irreversible airway obstruction. Which of the following is most likely to be associated with the recent loss of asthma control in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is D. Airway inflammation.

The patient's recent loss of asthma control, despite good compliance with controller medications, suggests that there may be an underlying factor contributing to increased airway inflammation. The development of nocturnal cough and mild wheezing over the past week or so indicates that the patient's asthma is not well-controlled, and inflammation is a key driver of asthma symptoms.

Airway inflammation is a hallmark of asthma, and it is likely that the patient's recent exacerbation is related to an increase in airway inflammation. This could be due to various factors such as exposure to allergens, respiratory infections, or other environmental triggers.

The other options are not directly related to the recent loss of asthma control:

A. Airway epithelial shedding is a feature of asthma, but it is not the primary factor contributing to the patient's recent exacerbation.

B. Airway smooth muscle atrophy is not typically associated with asthma, and it would not explain the patient's recent symptoms.

C. Airway remodeling is a long-term consequence of chronic asthma, but it is not the primary cause of the patient's recent loss of asthma control.

E. Airway hyperresponsiveness is a characteristic of asthma, but it is not the primary factor contributing to the patient's recent exacerbation.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines emphasize the importance of controlling airway inflammation in asthma management. According to GINA, ""inflammation is a key component of asthma, and its control is essential for achieving good asthma control.""",Success
"A 75-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of a 3-day history of a productive cough and shortness of breath. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F) and respirations are 32/min. Crackles are heard over the right upper and the entire left lung fields. Sputum culture confirms infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Despite appropriate therapy, the patient dies. A photomicrograph of a section of the lung obtained during the autopsy is shown. Which of the following mediators is most likely responsible for the presence of the cell-type indicated by the arrow?",B,"The correct answer is C. Interferon-gamma.

The photomicrograph shows a section of the lung with an inflammatory infiltrate, and the arrow is pointing to a macrophage. Macrophages are a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in the defense against bacterial infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is a cytokine that is produced by immune cells, including T cells and natural killer cells, in response to bacterial infections. IFN-γ is a key mediator of the immune response against intracellular pathogens, including bacteria like S. pneumoniae. It activates macrophages, increasing their ability to phagocytose and kill bacteria.

The other options are not directly related to the recruitment or activation of macrophages in response to bacterial infection:

A. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody involved in allergic reactions, not in the response to bacterial infections.

B. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a mediator involved in platelet activation and anaphylaxis, not in the recruitment of macrophages.

D. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can suppress the immune response, which is not consistent with the presence of macrophages in the lung tissue.

E. Leukotriene D4 is a mediator involved in allergic reactions and asthma, not in the response to bacterial infections.

Therefore, based on the photomicrograph and the clinical context, interferon-gamma (C) is the most likely mediator responsible for the presence of macrophages in the lung tissue.",Success
"A 2-month-old infant is brought to the emergency department by her mother due to a fall. Tearfully, the patient’s mother describes witnessing her child fall from the changing table. The patient was born prematurely at 36 weeks estimated gestational age via vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery. The patient is afebrile. Her vital signs include: blood pressure of 94/60 mm Hg, pulse 200/min, and respiratory rate 70/min. Physical examination reveals a subconjunctival hemorrhage in the left eye and multiple bruises on the chest and back. Which of the following is the best initial step in management of this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is E. Rule out medical conditions.

The patient's presentation with a fall from a changing table, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and multiple bruises on the chest and back raises concerns for potential abuse or neglect. However, before jumping to conclusions, it's essential to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the patient's injuries or symptoms.

Premature birth at 36 weeks and vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery may increase the risk of certain medical conditions, such as bleeding disorders or osteogenesis imperfecta, which could predispose the patient to bruising or fractures. Additionally, the patient's vital signs, particularly the tachycardia, may indicate an underlying condition that needs to be addressed.

Therefore, the best initial step is to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the patient's presentation. This may involve a thorough physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies as necessary.

While involving social services (Option B), informing the police (Option C), and family counseling (Option D) may be important steps in the management of this patient, they should not be the initial step. A CT scan of the head (Option A) may be necessary, but it should be done after a thorough evaluation and stabilization of the patient.

It's essential to approach this situation in a stepwise manner, prioritizing the patient's medical needs and ruling out potential underlying conditions before addressing potential social or legal concerns.",Success
"A researcher is interested in identifying the most effective treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) in women between the ages of 18 and 50.

The measured outcomes include progression to pyelonephritis, positive urine culture on day 7 after initiation of treatment, and likelihood of re-presenting to the emergency room for another UTI within 90 days. Which of the following best describes this type of study?",B,"The correct answer is A. Parallel study.

This study is a parallel study because it involves dividing the 200 women into four distinct groups, each receiving a different treatment regimen (nitrofurantoin for 5 days, nitrofurantoin for 7 days, cefpodoxime for 5 days, and cefpodoxime for 7 days). Each participant is assigned to only one group and receives only one treatment, and the outcomes are compared across the four groups.

A parallel study is a type of randomized controlled trial (RCT) where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups, and each group receives a different intervention or treatment. In this case, the four groups are parallel because they are separate and distinct, and each participant is only part of one group.

The other options are not accurate descriptions of this study:

B. Factorial design study: A factorial design study involves examining the effects of multiple factors or interventions simultaneously, often using a 2x2 or 2x2x2 design. This study does not involve examining the effects of multiple factors simultaneously.

C. Non-crossover study: A non-crossover study is a type of study where participants do not switch from one treatment to another during the study. While this is true of this study, it is not the most descriptive term for this type of study design.

D. Between patient study: This term is not a recognized study design term in medical research.

"A 31-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of acute onset neck pain and enlargement. Specifically, he reports that he has been experiencing pain and swelling of the anterior portion of his neck near the midline. Otherwise, he says that he has been getting tired easily and feels cold often. Physical exam reveals a painful diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with many small nodules. A biopsy is obtained showing diffuse cellular hyperplasia with areas of focal colloid hyperplasia. Given these findings, the patient is started on appropriate therapy, and the neck mass becomes smaller over time. Which of the following is most likely associated with the cause of this patient's symptoms?",C,"The correct answer is A. HLA-B8 risk factor.

The patient's symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism. The presence of a painful, diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with small nodules, along with symptoms of fatigue and cold intolerance, suggests an inflammatory process. The biopsy findings of diffuse cellular hyperplasia with areas of focal colloid hyperplasia also support this diagnosis.

HLA-B8 is a genetic risk factor associated with Graves' disease. Individuals with this genetic marker are more likely to develop the condition. The other options are not directly related to the cause of this patient's symptoms:

B. Increased 131-iodine uptake is a characteristic of Graves' disease, but it is not a cause of the condition.

C. Iodine deficiency can contribute to the development of goiter (thyroid enlargement), but it is not typically associated with the autoimmune process of Graves' disease.

D. Presence of embryological remnant is not relevant to this patient's symptoms or diagnosis.

E. Proliferation of fibroinflammatory cells is more characteristic of conditions like Riedel's thyroiditis, which is a rare inflammatory disorder of the thyroid gland. While it can cause thyroid enlargement and pain, it is not typically associated with the autoimmune features of Graves' disease.

A hepatitis viral panel is ordered which shows:
Anti-HAV IgM negative
HBsAg positive
Anti-HBs negative
IgM anti-HBc positive
Anti-HCV negative
Anti-HDV negative
What is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Acute hepatitis B.

Here's a breakdown of the patient's lab results and why they point to acute hepatitis B:

* HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) is positive, indicating the presence of the hepatitis B virus in the blood.
* IgM anti-HBc (immunoglobulin M antibody to hepatitis B core antigen) is positive, which is a marker of acute hepatitis B infection. IgM antibodies are the first to appear in response to an infection and typically indicate a recent or acute infection.
* Anti-HBs (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen) is negative, which suggests that the patient has not developed immunity to hepatitis B yet.
* The absence of anti-HAV IgM and anti-HCV rules out acute hepatitis A and C infections, respectively.
* The negative anti-HDV result makes acute hepatitis D superinfection unlikely, as HDV requires HBV to replicate.

Given the patient's symptoms, lab results, and risk factors (illicit IV drug use and lack of immunization records), the most likely diagnosis is acute hepatitis B infection.

Option A (past hepatitis B infection) is unlikely because the patient has a positive HBsAg and IgM anti-HBc, indicating an active infection. Option B (chronic hepatitis B) is also unlikely because the patient's symptoms and lab results suggest an acute infection rather than a chronic one. Option C (acute hepatitis A) is ruled out by the negative anti-HAV IgM result. Option D (acute hepatitis D superinfection) is unlikely due to the negative anti-HDV result.",Success

Platelets 250,000/mm3
Prothrombin Time 14 sec
Partial Thromboplastin Time 90 sec
Mixing study (PTT) 89 sec
What is the most likely cause of the patient’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Antibodies directed against phospholipids.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation with aching pain, swelling, and a positive Homan's sign in her left leg, along with the Doppler ultrasound finding of a thrombus in the left popliteal vein, suggests a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

The laboratory results provide important clues to the underlying cause of the DVT. The prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 90 seconds, which is not corrected by the mixing study, suggests the presence of a lupus anticoagulant. Lupus anticoagulants are a type of antiphospholipid antibody that can cause thrombosis, rather than bleeding, despite their name.

The patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks gestation further supports the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is a known complication of SLE. APS is characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, including lupus anticoagulants, and is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis and recurrent pregnancy loss.

The other options are not supported by the patient's presentation and laboratory results:

A. Antibodies directed against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa would be more likely to cause thrombocytopenia, which is not present in this patient.

C. Antibodies directed against endothelial cells are not a known cause of DVT or APS.

D. Vitamin K deficiency would be expected to cause a prolonged prothrombin time (PT), which is not seen in this patient.

E. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) would be expected to cause a more severe coagulopathy, with elevated PT and PTT, and a decreased platelet count, which is not seen in this patient.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, specifically lupus anticoagulants, which are causing the DVT.",Success
"A 22-year-old woman with a history of asthma visits her physician for worsening shortness of breath. She states that she feels as though her “lungs are falling apart,” noting that her lung function has been steadily deteriorating. She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from “random” bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, “Yes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.” She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs.

On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base. There are also branched radiodensities that the radiologist notes as being “glove-finger shadows” (noted by the arrow in the image). Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are elevated. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Prednisone.

This patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal transport of salt and water in the body, leading to thick, sticky mucus buildup in the lungs and other organs. The patient's history of asthma, recurrent pneumonia, and excessive coughing with greenish sputum containing specks of red blood cells, as well as the presence of inspiratory crackles and coarse breath sounds on auscultation, support this diagnosis.

The chest radiograph showing atelectasis in the right lung base and ""glove-finger shadows"" (also known as ""tree-in-bud"" opacities) is a classic radiographic finding in CF. The elevated serum IgE levels also support this diagnosis, as CF patients often have elevated IgE levels due to chronic inflammation.

Prednisone, a corticosteroid, is an appropriate therapy in this patient because it can help reduce inflammation in the lungs and alleviate symptoms such as coughing and wheezing. While antibiotics may be necessary to treat underlying infections, prednisone is a key component of CF management to reduce airway inflammation and improve lung function.

The other options are not directly related to the management of CF:

A. Isoniazid is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis, which is not suspected in this patient.

B. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections, which is not indicated in this patient.

C. Caspofungin is an antifungal medication used to treat invasive fungal infections, which is not suspected in this patient.

E. Surgical resection of the infiltrates is not a primary treatment for CF and would not address the underlying disease process.

A peripheral smear was performed and is shown below. Despite ventilatory support, administration of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressor agents, the patient died the next day. A gram stain from an autopsy specimen of the lungs revealed gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains. Which of the following organisms is most likely?",C,"The correct answer is C. Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as fever, diarrhea, and respiratory distress, are consistent with a severe infection.
* The peripheral smear shows lancet-shaped diplococci, which is a characteristic morphology of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
* The gram stain from the autopsy specimen of the lungs also reveals gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci, further supporting the diagnosis of S. pneumoniae.
* The patient's history of a motor vehicle accident and surgery as a teenager may suggest that he has a splenectomy or asplenia, which increases the risk of severe infections, particularly with encapsulated bacteria like S. pneumoniae.
* The patient's laboratory results, including leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and disseminated coagulation, are consistent with a severe sepsis syndrome, which is often seen in infections with S. pneumoniae.

While other options, such as Staphylococcus aureus (A) and Streptococcus pyogenes (B), can cause severe infections, the morphology of the diplococci on the peripheral smear and the gram stain from the autopsy specimen are more consistent with S. pneumoniae. Neisseria meningitidis (D) is also a possibility, but the lack of meningeal signs and symptoms, as well as the morphology of the diplococci, make S. pneumoniae a more likely diagnosis. Non-typeable H. influenzae (E) is not typically associated with this type of severe infection.

2. Abdominal pain, often with vomiting, due to intestinal edema.
3. A history of similar episodes, often triggered by trauma or stress.

C. Drug-induced bradykinin excess is related to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema, which is not consistent with the patient's medical history.

D. Leukotriene overproduction is associated with asthma and allergic reactions, which do not typically present with angioedema.

E. Mast-cell activation is more characteristic of anaphylaxis or allergic reactions, which typically present with pruritus, urticaria, and other symptoms not seen in this patient.

"A healthy 21-year-old man undergoes physical fitness testing prior to long-term submarine deployment. To evaluate his pulmonary function, lung and thoracic compliance are measured at different system pressures. A graph of the relationship between his lung volume and transpulmonary pressure is shown. The dotted line in this graph corresponds to which of the following lung volumes?",D,"The correct answer is D. Functional residual capacity.

The graph shows the relationship between lung volume and transpulmonary pressure. The dotted line represents the point at which the lung volume is at functional residual capacity (FRC), which is the volume of air remaining in the lungs at the end of a normal exhalation. This is the point at which the transpulmonary pressure is zero, meaning that the pressure inside the lungs is equal to the pressure outside the lungs.

FRC is an important lung volume that represents the equilibrium point between the elastic recoil of the lungs and the chest wall. It is typically around 2.3 liters in a healthy adult male.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Inspiratory capacity is the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal exhalation, which is not represented by the dotted line on the graph.

B. Vital capacity is the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled after a maximum inhalation, which is also not represented by the dotted line.

C. Tidal volume is the volume of air inhaled or exhaled during a normal breath, which is not relevant to the graph.

E. Total lung capacity is the maximum amount of air that the lungs can hold, which is not represented by the dotted line on the graph.

"A 3-day-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a 4-hour history of somnolence, poor feeding, and one episode of vomiting. He is exclusively breastfed. His serum glucose concentration is 88 mg/dL and his serum ammonia concentration is 850 μmol/L (N<90). Urinalysis shows an increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio. Urinary ketones are absent. This patient is most likely deficient in an enzyme that catalyzes which of the following reactions?",A,"The correct answer is A. Ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as somnolence, poor feeding, and vomiting, are consistent with a metabolic disorder. The elevated serum ammonia concentration (850 μmol/L, normal <90) suggests a defect in the urea cycle, which is responsible for detoxifying ammonia in the body.

The increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio in the urinalysis also points to a urea cycle defect. Orotic acid is a byproduct of carbamoyl phosphate synthesis, which is a key step in the urea cycle.

The absence of urinary ketones suggests that the patient's symptoms are not related to a fatty acid oxidation disorder or a defect in the citric acid cycle.

Among the options, the correct answer is A. Ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline, which is the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC). OTC is a key enzyme in the urea cycle, and a deficiency in this enzyme would lead to the accumulation of ammonia and orotic acid, consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

The other options are not directly related to the urea cycle or the patient's symptoms:

B. Orotic acid to uridine monophosphate is a reaction involved in pyrimidine synthesis, not the urea cycle.

C. Pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A is a reaction involved in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, not the urea cycle.

D. Glutamate and acetyl-coenzyme A to N-acetylglutamate is a reaction involved in the synthesis of N-acetylglutamate, an activator of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I, but it is not directly related to the urea cycle.

E. Arginine to urea and ornithine is a reaction involved in the urea cycle, but it is catalyzed by the enzyme arginase, not the enzyme deficient in this patient.",Success
"A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dragging pelvic pain and a 3 kg (6 lb 9 oz) weight loss over the past 6 months. Menses occur at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals; her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate is 102/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Physical examination shows hyperreflexia. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass. This adnexal mass is most likely derived from which of the following cell types?",B,"The correct answer is D. Endometrial cells.

The patient's symptoms, such as pelvic pain, irregular menses, and weight loss, are consistent with endometriosis. The presence of a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass on ultrasonography further supports this diagnosis. Endometriomas, also known as chocolate cysts, are a type of adnexal mass that occurs in women with endometriosis. They are derived from endometrial cells that have implanted on the ovary and formed a cystic structure.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings:

A. Ovarian epithelial cells are more likely to give rise to ovarian epithelial tumors, such as serous or mucinous cystadenomas, which are not typically associated with endometriosis.

B. Germ cells are the precursors to oocytes and are not typically associated with adnexal masses in women of reproductive age.

C. Chorionic epithelial cells are involved in the development of the placenta during pregnancy, but the patient's urine pregnancy test is negative, making this option unlikely.

E. Stromal cells are a type of ovarian cell that can give rise to various types of ovarian tumors, but they are not typically associated with endometriosis or hypoechoic adnexal masses.

It's worth noting that the patient's hyperreflexia is not directly related to the adnexal mass, but it could be a sign of underlying hyperthyroidism, which should be evaluated further.",Success
"A 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department with the complaint of pain in his right toe for the past hour. The pain is so severe that it woke him up. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 40 years and binge drinks alcohol after work and on the weekends. He underwent an appendectomy when he was 14 years old. He is a long-distance truck driver. Neither of his parents had any significant medical history. His temperature is 37.7°C (100°F), blood pressure is 135/75 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, respiratory rate is 20/min, and BMI is 25 kg/m2. On examination, his right first metatarsophalangeal joint is very tender, swollen, warm, and red in color. Range of motion cannot be assessed due to extreme tenderness.
Laboratory test
Complete blood count:
Hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL
Leukocytes 16,000/mm3
Platelets 150,000/mm3
ESR 50 mm/hr
Synovial fluid is aspirated from the joint. The findings are:
Appearance Cloudy, dense yellow
WBC 30,000 cells/µL
Culture Negative
Needle-shaped birefringent crystals are observed in the joint aspirate. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is C. Lysis of large numbers of cells.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with an acute gouty attack. The presence of needle-shaped birefringent crystals in the joint aspirate is a hallmark feature of gout. Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints.

The most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition is the lysis of large numbers of cells, which leads to the release of nucleic acids and subsequent conversion to uric acid. This excess uric acid can then precipitate out of solution and form crystals in the joints, causing inflammation and pain.

Option A is incorrect because organic acids competing with urate for tubular secretion would actually decrease uric acid levels, not increase them.

Option B is also incorrect because increased renal reabsorption of urate would lead to decreased uric acid levels, not increased levels.

Option D is incorrect because a deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) is a rare genetic disorder that can cause gout, but it is not the most likely underlying cause in this patient.

Option E is incorrect because while a high-purine diet can contribute to hyperuricemia and gout, it is not the primary underlying cause of the patient's condition.

It's worth noting that the patient's lifestyle factors, such as smoking and binge drinking, may have contributed to his increased risk of developing gout. Additionally, his occupation as a long-distance truck driver may have led to decreased mobility and increased risk of developing gout.",Success
"A 33-year-old man presents to the infectious diseases clinic for follow-up. He was recently admitted to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and cough, and was found to have Pneumocystic jirovecii pneumonia and a new diagnosis of HIV. His CD4 count is 175, viral load is pending. As part of routine laboratory studies given his new diagnosis, an RPR was found to be positive with a titer of 1:64, and this is confirmed with a positive FTA-ABS. He is unsure when or how he acquired HIV or syphilis. His neurological examination is normal, and he has no symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management:",C,"The correct answer is C. Treat with three weekly injections of penicillin, obtain titers in 6 months.

Here's why:

The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV and syphilis, with a positive RPR and FTA-ABS, indicating active syphilis infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommend that patients with HIV and syphilis be treated with a regimen that covers neurosyphilis, as they are at higher risk of developing central nervous system (CNS) involvement.

The CDC recommends treating HIV-infected patients with syphilis with three weekly injections of benzathine penicillin G, 2.4 million units IM, to cover neurosyphilis. This is because HIV-infected individuals may not respond as well to treatment as HIV-negative individuals, and may be more likely to develop CNS involvement.

Option A is incorrect because, although a lumbar puncture may be performed to evaluate for CNS involvement, it is not necessary to perform one before initiating treatment. Additionally, treatment should not be based solely on the presence or absence of CNS disease.

Options B and D are incorrect because they do not provide adequate treatment for neurosyphilis. A single injection of penicillin or three weekly injections without follow-up titers in 6 months may not be sufficient to ensure adequate treatment and monitoring of the infection.

Option E is incorrect because, while a single injection of penicillin may be used to treat early syphilis, it is not recommended for HIV-infected individuals, who require more aggressive treatment to cover neurosyphilis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to treat the patient with three weekly injections of penicillin, and obtain titers in 6 months to monitor treatment response.",Success
"A 67-year old man presents to his primary care physician for his yearly checkup. He has not noticed any major changes in his health over the last year but says that unfortunately, he stopped exercising because he has been stressed by work. His past medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipidemia. He is taking a number of drugs but does not remember what they are. A panel of metabolic and lipid tests are ordered and show worsening of his metabolic parameters. Based on these findings, his physician prescribes a drug that leads to a large decrease in triglycerides with a much smaller increase in high-density lipoproteins and decrease in low-density lipoproteins. The drug that was most likely prescribed in this case is associated with which of the following side effects?",B,"The correct answer is D. Hepatotoxicity.

Based on the patient's history and the effects of the prescribed drug on triglycerides, HDL, and LDL, it is likely that the drug prescribed is a fibrate, such as gemfibrozil or fenofibrate. Fibrates are commonly used to treat hypertriglyceridemia and are known to decrease triglycerides significantly, with a smaller increase in HDL and decrease in LDL.

Fibrates are associated with a risk of hepatotoxicity, which is a known side effect of this class of medications. This is because fibrates can cause an increase in liver enzymes, which can lead to liver damage or failure in rare cases.

The other options are not directly related to the side effects of fibrates:

A. Acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition characterized by dark, velvety skin patches, often associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

B. Cholelithiasis, or gallstones, is a potential side effect of fibrates, but it is not the most likely answer based on the information provided.

C. Decreased vitamin D absorption is not a known side effect of fibrates.

E. Teratogenicity is a concern for certain medications, but it is not a known side effect of fibrates, which are not typically used in pregnant women.

"A 29-year-old woman presents to her OB/GYN for a preconception visit. She wishes to become pregnant within the next several months. A thorough history reveals that the patient suffers from phenylketonuria (PKU). She recalls being instructed by prior physicians to follow a diet that avoids certain foods; however, she admits to not being complaint with these recommendations. Laboratory testing reveals a plasma phenylalanine level of 20.2 mg/dL (normal range <2 mg/dL). Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. 3 months prior to conception, begin a restricted diet to lower phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of the amino acid phenylalanine. Elevated levels of phenylalanine can be toxic to the developing fetus, increasing the risk of spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal death, and congenital anomalies. Women with PKU who become pregnant with elevated phenylalanine levels are at risk of having children with microcephaly, intellectual disability, and other birth defects.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommend that women with PKU achieve and maintain a plasma phenylalanine level below 6 mg/dL before conception and throughout pregnancy to minimize the risk of adverse fetal outcomes.

In this scenario, the patient's current plasma phenylalanine level of 20.2 mg/dL is significantly elevated, and she should be advised to begin a phenylalanine-restricted diet at least 3 months prior to conception to lower her levels to below 6 mg/dL. This will reduce the risk of spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal death, and congenital anomalies.

Option A is incorrect because PKU does not prevent pregnancy, but rather, elevated phenylalanine levels during pregnancy can have adverse effects on the fetus. Option B is correct, but it does not provide specific guidance on when to initiate treatment. Option D is incorrect because the diet should be initiated before conception, not in the first trimester. Option E is incorrect because the patient's current phenylalanine levels do pose a risk to any future pregnancy.",Success

The pain is usually at its worst in the morning, but it remains throughout the day. It gets better with movement, however, so he tends to do some light exercises every day. He also has heel pain and feels significant pressure while walking. Laboratory analysis reveals increased ESR and CRP serum levels. Which of the following would most likely be seen in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Aortic regurgitation.

The patient's symptoms, including sudden onset of severe eye pain and redness, difficulty seeing, and a history of progressive lower back pain, heel pain, and morning stiffness, are consistent with a diagnosis of Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). AS is a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects the spine and can also cause inflammation in other parts of the body, such as the eyes.

The laboratory results showing increased ESR and CRP serum levels support this diagnosis, as they indicate the presence of inflammation. AS is also known to be associated with aortic regurgitation, which is a condition where the aortic valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow backwards from the aorta into the left ventricle.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and diagnosis:

A. Dry mouth is a symptom of Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that affects the exocrine glands.

B. Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, which could be a symptom of AS, but it is not a specific feature of the disease.

The pain lasts 10–15 minutes and resolves spontaneously. She is unable to identify any common preceding event to pain onset. The remainder of her history is unremarkable and she takes no regular medications. She works as an accountant. There is no history of smoking or drug use, however, she does consume 5 alcoholic drinks per week. Examination reveals: pulse 70/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg. A physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following would be effective in reducing her symptoms?",C,"The correct answer is C. Isosorbide dinitrate.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with angina pectoris, which is characterized by recurrent episodes of chest pain or discomfort that occur when the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood. The fact that the pain wakes her up at night and occurs at random times during the day, without any identifiable triggers, suggests that it may be related to vasospasm rather than physical exertion.

Isosorbide dinitrate is a nitrate medication that is commonly used to treat angina pectoris. It works by dilating the coronary arteries, reducing the workload of the heart, and increasing blood flow to the heart muscle. This can help to reduce the frequency and severity of angina episodes.

The other options are not effective in reducing the patient's symptoms:

A. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that is used to prevent blood clots, but it is not typically used to treat angina pectoris.

B. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that is used to treat atrial fibrillation and heart failure, but it is not effective in treating angina pectoris.

D. Heparin is an anticoagulant that is used to prevent blood clots, but it is not used to treat angina pectoris.

E. Propranolol is a beta blocker that is used to treat hypertension, angina pectoris, and certain heart rhythm disorders. While it can be used to treat angina pectoris, it is not the best choice in this scenario because it can exacerbate vasospasm, which is suspected to be the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

It's worth noting that the patient's symptoms should be further evaluated with diagnostic tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, and/or a stress test to confirm the diagnosis of angina pectoris and to rule out other potential causes of chest pain.",Success

The tonsils are not notably enlarged. Laboratory work-up shows an elevated lymphocyte count, atypical lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear, and a positive heterophile antibody screen. Which of the following is the best management of this patient's condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Bed rest and activity limitation.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with infectious mononucleosis (IM), caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The positive heterophile antibody screen, also known as the Monospot test, is a specific diagnostic test for IM.

The management of IM is primarily supportive, focusing on alleviating symptoms and promoting recovery. Bed rest and activity limitation are essential to help the patient conserve energy and reduce the risk of complications, such as splenic rupture.

The other options are not appropriate for the management of IM:

B. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication, but it is not effective against EBV.

C. Ganciclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, not EBV.

D. Amoxicillin is an antibiotic that may exacerbate the symptoms of IM, particularly the development of a rash.

E. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that may be used in severe cases of IM to reduce inflammation and swelling, but it is not a first-line treatment and should only be considered in specific circumstances, such as airway obstruction or severe hemolytic anemia.

He has hypertension, for which he has been taking hydrochlorothiazide for the past 6 months. He drinks 9 glasses of water per day and takes his medication regularly. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 90 kg (198 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. His temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), blood pressure is 106/54 mm Hg, and pulse is 92/min.

Hemoglobin A1C 10.5%
Urine
Osmolality 400 mOsm/kg
Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Osmotic diuresis.

Here's a breakdown of the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

* Nausea, vomiting, weakness, and dizziness suggest dehydration.
* The patient's blood pressure is low, which is consistent with dehydration.
* The physical examination findings of whitening of the tongue and delayed skin turgor (skin that is pinched on the back of the hand retracts after 5 seconds) also suggest dehydration.
* The laboratory results show:
	+ Hyponatremia (Na+ 150 mEq/L), which is consistent with dehydration.
	+ Normal potassium levels (K+ 3.6 mEq/L).
	+ Elevated bicarbonate levels (HCO3− 30 mEq/L), which suggests a metabolic alkalosis.
	+ Normal serum osmolality (354 mOsm/kg).
	+ Elevated urine osmolality (400 mOsm/kg), which suggests that the kidneys are responding to dehydration by concentrating the urine.
	+ Elevated hemoglobin A1C (10.5%), which suggests uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

Given these findings, the most likely explanation is osmotic diuresis due to uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. The high blood glucose levels are causing an osmotic diuresis, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. The diuretic effect of hydrochlorothiazide may be contributing to the dehydration, but it is not the primary cause.

Here's why the other options are not correct:

A. Diuretic overdose: While the patient is taking hydrochlorothiazide, the laboratory results do not suggest an overdose. The serum potassium levels are normal, and the urine osmolality is elevated, suggesting that the kidneys are responding to dehydration.

C. Gastrointestinal fluid loss: The patient does not have diarrhea, and the laboratory results do not suggest significant gastrointestinal fluid loss.

D. Excess production of aldosterone: The patient's potassium levels are normal, and there is no evidence of hypertension or hypokalemia, which would be expected with excess aldosterone production.

E. Insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone: The patient's urine osmolality is elevated, suggesting that the kidneys are responding to dehydration by concentrating the urine. This is inconsistent with insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone.",Success

The physician informs the patient that she is ""pre-diabetic"" or at risk of developing diabetes and recommends lifestyle modification with follow-up in 6 months. Which of the following endogenous signaling molecules or receptors will increase insulin sensitivity in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ).

Here's why:

The patient's test results indicate impaired glucose tolerance, which is a precursor to type 2 diabetes. The physician's recommendation for lifestyle modification aims to increase insulin sensitivity, reducing the risk of developing diabetes.

PPARγ is a nuclear receptor that plays a crucial role in glucose and lipid metabolism. Activation of PPARγ increases insulin sensitivity by enhancing glucose uptake in adipose tissue and skeletal muscles, improving glucose metabolism, and reducing insulin resistance. Thiazolidinediones, a class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes, work by activating PPARγ, which in turn increases insulin sensitivity.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Catecholamines (such as epinephrine and norepinephrine) have the opposite effect, decreasing insulin sensitivity and increasing glucose release from storage sites.

B. Glucagon is a hormone that raises blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver, making it counterproductive for increasing insulin sensitivity.

C. Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, can cause insulin resistance and worsen glucose metabolism, making them undesirable for increasing insulin sensitivity.

E. TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that can contribute to insulin resistance and worsen glucose metabolism, making it an unfavorable choice for increasing insulin sensitivity.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American Diabetes Association, emphasize the importance of lifestyle modifications, including weight loss and physical activity, to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance.",Success
"A 35-year-old male presents to the emergency department for evaluation of hemoptysis. A chest X-ray reveals bilateral focal pulmonary consolidation. On further questioning, he admits having hematuria. Urinalysis shows RBC casts and 400 mL of urine is excreted in 24 hours. What is the most likely cause of hemoptysis and hematuria in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies.

Here's why:

The patient presents with hemoptysis (bleeding in the lungs) and hematuria (blood in the urine), which suggests a possible connection between the kidneys and lungs. The presence of RBC casts in the urinalysis indicates glomerular damage, and the 400 mL of urine excreted in 24 hours suggests that the patient's kidney function is not severely impaired.

The combination of hemoptysis and hematuria, along with glomerular damage, points towards a diagnosis of Goodpasture's syndrome. This is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of anti-GBM antibodies, which target the basement membranes of both the lungs and kidneys. These antibodies cause inflammation and damage to the alveolar and glomerular basement membranes, leading to bleeding in the lungs and kidneys.

The other options are not directly related to the combination of hemoptysis and hematuria:

A. Anti-Smith antibodies are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, which may cause hematuria but is less likely to cause hemoptysis.

B. Anti-neutrophil antibodies are associated with vasculitis, which can cause hemoptysis but is less likely to cause hematuria with RBC casts.

C. Anti-mitochondrial antibodies are associated with primary biliary cirrhosis, which is not typically related to hemoptysis or hematuria.

D. Anti-nuclear antibodies are a non-specific marker of autoimmune disorders and do not specifically point to a diagnosis of Goodpasture's syndrome.

Therefore, the most likely cause of hemoptysis and hematuria in this patient is the presence of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, which is consistent with Goodpasture's syndrome.",Success
A 34-year-old man comes to the physician with a 2-month history of difficulty concentrating at work. He is worried he may lose his job due to poor performance.

His wife has noticed that he has been speaking more slowly than usual and his appetite has decreased. He used to enjoy dance classes with her but has not been as interested in this recently. He is a veteran who returned from a deployment to Afghanistan 2 years ago. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,A,"The correct answer is A. Major depressive disorder.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as difficulty concentrating, fatigue, slowed speech, decreased appetite, and loss of interest in activities (anhedonia), are all consistent with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). The patient's symptoms have been present for at least 2 months, which meets the duration criterion for MDD.

While the patient's history of deployment to Afghanistan 2 years ago may suggest a possible connection to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the symptoms described are more characteristic of MDD. PTSD would typically involve symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance of stimuli related to the traumatic event, and hyperarousal, which are not mentioned in this scenario.

Persistent depressive disorder (PDD) is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms seem more severe and pervasive than what is typically seen in PDD. Adjustment disorder is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms have persisted for 2 months, and adjustment disorder typically resolves within 6 months of the stressor.

Acute stress disorder is not a good fit, as it typically occurs within 3 days to 1 month after a traumatic event, and the patient's symptoms have been present for 2 months.

Her temperature is 98.9°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 75/min, and respirations are 16/min. On examination, her pupils are equally round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. Mild ptosis is noted bilaterally but worse on the left. A visual acuity test reveals no abnormalities. Which of the following medications is most appropriate in the management of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Pyridostigmine.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the double vision, worsening fatigue, and mild ptosis, are consistent with myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disorder affecting the neuromuscular junction. The worsening of symptoms in the evenings is also characteristic of MG.

Pyridostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which is a first-line medication for the treatment of myasthenia gravis. It works by increasing the amount of acetylcholine available at the neuromuscular junction, thereby improving muscle strength and reducing fatigue.

Physostigmine (option B) is also an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, but it is not typically used for the long-term management of MG due to its short duration of action and potential side effects.

Edrophonium (option C) is a short-acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor used primarily as a diagnostic tool to confirm the diagnosis of MG, particularly in patients with ocular symptoms. It is not used for long-term management.

Hydrocortisone (option D) is a corticosteroid that may be used in some cases of MG to reduce inflammation and immune system activity, but it is not a primary treatment for MG.

Azathioprine (option E) is an immunosuppressive medication that may be used in combination with other medications to treat MG, but it is not a first-line treatment and is typically reserved for more severe cases or those who do not respond to other therapies.

In this case, pyridostigmine is the most appropriate medication for the management of this patient's symptoms, which are consistent with myasthenia gravis.",Success
"A 76-year-old woman visits a physician for a general medical examination. She is asymptomatic. Six months prior, she had a cerebral stroke with left hemiparesis, from which she has almost completely recovered with physiotherapy. She has a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation (AF). She has no significant ischemic, valvular, or structural heart disease. She takes metoprolol, amlodipine, warfarin, and atorvastatin. Blood pressure is 125/70 mm Hg, pulse is 75/min with an irregular rhythm. Respirations are 13/min. She has a minor limp and weakness in her left arm and leg. Heart exam shows no abnormalities other than irregular beats. To assess adherence and therapeutic efficacy in this patient, which of the following studies should be ordered?",C,"The correct answer is C. International normalized ratio (INR).

Justification:

The patient is taking warfarin, an oral anticoagulant, to prevent stroke recurrence in the setting of atrial fibrillation (AF). Warfarin's therapeutic efficacy and adherence can be assessed by monitoring the international normalized ratio (INR). The INR is a standardized measure of the prothrombin time (PT) that allows for comparison of results across different laboratories. The target INR range for stroke prevention in AF is typically between 2.0 and 3.0.

The other options are not directly related to assessing adherence and therapeutic efficacy of warfarin:

A. Echocardiogram: While an echocardiogram can evaluate cardiac structure and function, it is not necessary in this asymptomatic patient with a known diagnosis of AF and no significant valvular or structural heart disease.

B. Electrocardiogram (ECG): An ECG may show the irregular rhythm of AF, but it does not provide information on warfarin's therapeutic efficacy or adherence.

D. Partial thromboplastin time (PTT): PTT is used to monitor unfractionated heparin therapy, not warfarin.

E. Serum drug levels: Measuring serum levels of metoprolol, amlodipine, or atorvastatin may be useful in certain situations, but it is not directly related to assessing warfarin's therapeutic efficacy or adherence.

In summary, ordering an INR is the most appropriate choice to assess adherence and therapeutic efficacy of warfarin in this patient.",Success
"A 4-year-old boy is brought to his primary care physician for a physical prior to beginning a preschool program. He is found to be delayed in reaching normal childhood cognitive and social milestones, which is consistent with observations at previous check-ups. Physically, he is also found to be significantly overweight with hypogonadism. Notably, the boy was limp when he was born and did not have a normal motor response to stimuli. Elevated levels of a gastrointestinal hormone are associated with the cause of this patient's weight gain. The hormone that is most responsible for causing the weight gain is produced in which of the following cell types?",D,"The correct answer is E. L cells.

The patient's symptoms, including delayed cognitive and social milestones, hypogonadism, and significant overweight, are consistent with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). PWS is a genetic disorder caused by the deletion or mutation of genes on chromosome 15.

The hormone associated with weight gain in PWS is ghrelin, a gastrointestinal hormone produced by L cells in the intestinal mucosa. Ghrelin stimulates appetite and increases food intake, leading to obesity. Elevated ghrelin levels are a hallmark of PWS, contributing to the characteristic hyperphagia and weight gain.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. D cells produce somatostatin, which inhibits the release of other hormones, including growth hormone and insulin.

B. G cells produce gastrin, which stimulates gastric acid secretion and gastric motility.

C. I cells produce cholecystokinin (CCK), which stimulates gallbladder contraction and pancreatic enzyme secretion.

D. There is no such cell type as P/D1 cells.

It's essential to note that while ghrelin is associated with weight gain in PWS, it's not the sole cause of the condition. PWS is a complex genetic disorder requiring a comprehensive approach to management, including behavioral therapy, dietary restrictions, and hormonal interventions.",Success
"Accurate and rapid identification of individuals with tuberculosis (TB) is crucial to accomplishing the goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to eliminate this disease. One of the key strategies for the detection of TB is the use of tuberculin skin testing as a globally pertinent screening method, due to its low cost and technical simplicity. A study from Brazil demonstrated 76.7% accuracy, 67.9% sensitivity, 84.4% specificity, 79.1% positive predictive value, and 75% negative predictive value when using 5-mm skin elevation as a threshold, or cut-off, point for the screening test (following intradermal injection). Lowering the cut-off point to 4 mm would also result in an increase in which test property?",D,"The correct answer is D. Negative predictive value.

When the cut-off point for a diagnostic test is lowered, it means that more individuals will be classified as test-positive. This will result in an increase in the number of true negatives (individuals who do not have TB and test negative) and false positives (individuals who do not have TB but test positive).

As a consequence, the negative predictive value (NPV) will increase. NPV is the proportion of individuals with a negative test result who do not have the disease. With a lower cut-off point, more individuals will be correctly identified as not having TB, leading to an increase in NPV.

On the other hand, lowering the cut-off point will likely decrease the specificity of the test, as more false positives will be included. Therefore, option E (test specificity) is incorrect.

Convergent validity (option A) and discriminant validity (option B) are types of validity that refer to the extent to which a test measures what it is supposed to measure and distinguishes between different concepts, respectively. They are not directly related to the effect of changing the cut-off point on test properties.

Positive predictive value (option C) is the proportion of individuals with a positive test result who have the disease. Lowering the cut-off point may actually decrease the PPV, as more false positives will be included.

In summary, lowering the cut-off point for the tuberculin skin test will increase the negative predictive value, making option D the correct answer.",Success
"A 55-year-old caucasian male is transferred to a tertiary care hospital from a small county hospital where he presented with jaundice and severe abdominal pain that radiates to the back. While in the county hospital, he did not develop fever, and his vital signs were stable for the 48 hours he spent at there. Initial laboratory tests are given below:
Total bilirubin 7 mg/dL
Direct bilirubin 6.4 mg/dL
AST 100
ALT 40
Alkaline phosphatase 480 IU/L
Glucose 160 mg/dL
The patient’s medical history is relevant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus. He admits to smoking cigarettes since his early teenage years. Moderate icterus is evident during physical examination, the abdomen is distended and dull to percussion, and there is periumbilical tenderness. Which of the following markers would you expect to be elevated in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. CA 19-9.

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is obstructive jaundice due to a pancreatic or biliary tract malignancy. The patient's presentation with jaundice, severe abdominal pain radiating to the back, and periumbilical tenderness suggests a possible pancreatic or bile duct obstruction.

The laboratory results support this diagnosis, with elevated total and direct bilirubin levels, indicating conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is consistent with obstructive jaundice. The elevated alkaline phosphatase level also suggests cholestasis.

CA 19-9 is a tumor marker that is often elevated in patients with pancreatic cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, or other biliary tract malignancies. It is a sialylated Lewis antigen that is expressed on the surface of pancreatic and biliary epithelial cells and can be shed into the bloodstream in response to malignant transformation.

The other options are not directly related to pancreatic or biliary tract malignancies:

A. CA 125 is a tumor marker often elevated in ovarian cancer.

B. Alpha-fetoprotein is a tumor marker often elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma or germ cell tumors.

C. Desmin is a muscle-specific protein that is not typically associated with pancreatic or biliary tract malignancies.

D. CA 27-29 is a tumor marker often elevated in breast cancer.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, CA 19-9 is the most likely marker to be elevated in this patient.",Success
"A one-week-old, full-term infant born by uncomplicated vaginal delivery is brought to a pediatrician by his mother, who notes that her daughter's skin appears yellow. She reports that the child cries several times per day and sleeps 7-8 hours at night, uninterrupted. She has been breastfeeding exclusively and feels that he has been feeding well. Which of the following is the best treatment for this condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Continue normal breast feeding.

The scenario described is consistent with physiologic jaundice, a common and benign condition in newborns. Physiologic jaundice typically appears on the 2nd to 3rd day of life, peaks around day 5-7, and resolves by 1-2 weeks. It is caused by the breakdown of fetal hemoglobin, which releases bilirubin, a yellow pigment that can accumulate in the skin and cause jaundice.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that breastfeeding infants with physiologic jaundice continue to breastfeed normally, as breast milk helps to reduce bilirubin levels. In fact, the AAP states that ""breastfeeding should not be discontinued or supplemented with formula in infants with jaundice unless there is evidence of inadequate milk intake or other underlying conditions.""

Phototherapy (option A) may be necessary for infants with more severe jaundice or those at risk for bilirubin encephalopathy, but it is not indicated for physiologic jaundice.

Phenobarbital administration (option B) is not a treatment for physiologic jaundice.

Plasma exchange (option C) is a treatment for severe hemolytic disease, not physiologic jaundice.

Switching from breast milk to formula (option D) is not recommended, as it may disrupt the establishment of a good milk supply and is not necessary for physiologic jaundice.

Therefore, the best treatment for this condition is to continue normal breast feeding (option E).",Success
"A 35-year-old woman arrives to the clinic complaining of progressive urinary leakage that has occurred for the past 1 year. At first, she would notice leakage only during athletic exercise, but now the incontinence occurs even when she laughs or coughs. The patient states that she goes to the bathroom more frequently to try to prevent “wetting myself.” She wakes up once a night to urinate. She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she “needs to focus.” The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use. Pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable. When that patient is asked to Valsalva, leakage of urine is observed. A urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Urethral hypermobility.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as progressive urinary leakage, especially during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., laughing, coughing), and the observation of urine leakage during the Valsalva maneuver, suggest stress urinary incontinence (SUI). SUI is a type of urinary incontinence that occurs when the muscles and tissues that support the bladder and urethra are weakened, allowing urine to leak out during physical activity.

Urethral hypermobility, which is a common cause of SUI, occurs when the urethra and bladder neck move downward during increased intra-abdominal pressure, leading to urine leakage. The patient's history of vaginal delivery 10 years ago and cesarean section 4 years ago may have contributed to the weakening of the pelvic floor muscles and ligaments, leading to urethral hypermobility.

The other options can be ruled out based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings:

A. Diabetic polyuria: The patient's urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits, which suggests that she does not have polyuria (excessive urine production) characteristic of diabetes.

B. Overactive detrusor muscle: The patient's symptoms are more consistent with SUI than overactive bladder, which typically presents with urinary urgency, frequency, and nocturia (waking up at night to urinate). Although the patient wakes up once a night to urinate, her primary complaint is urinary leakage during physical activity.

C. Primary polydipsia: The patient's fluid intake is not excessive, and she does not have symptoms of polyuria or nocturia that would suggest primary polydipsia (excessive thirst).

E. Vescicovaginal fistula: The patient's pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable, and there is no evidence of abnormal vaginal discharge or other symptoms suggestive of a vescicovaginal fistula (an abnormal connection between the bladder and vagina).",Success
"A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after an episode of altered mental status. She was at a party when she suddenly fell to the floor. Her friends state that she was not responsive and was acting oddly. After the episode, the patient seemed confused and had no memory of the event. The patient has a past medical history of substance abuse, depression, and anxiety. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 117/69 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals a girl who seems confused and responds to questions slowly. Her gait is stable, and she demonstrates 5/5 strength in her upper and lower extremities. Laboratory values and a urine dipstick test are performed as seen below:

Toxicology:
Benzodiazepines: Positive
Marijuana: Positive
Cocaine: Negative
Phencyclidine: Negative

Urine Dipstick:
Appearance: Dark
Red blood cells: Positive
Glucose: Negative

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. IV fluids and mannitol.

The patient's presentation, laboratory values, and urine dipstick test suggest a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, which is a condition characterized by muscle breakdown and release of muscle enzymes into the bloodstream. The positive urine dipstick test for red blood cells, dark appearance of the urine, and absence of glucose suggest myoglobinuria, a hallmark of rhabdomyolysis.

The patient's history of substance abuse, particularly benzodiazepine use, may have contributed to the episode of altered mental status. However, the primary concern is the potential for acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to rhabdomyolysis.

The best next step in management is to administer IV fluids and mannitol to help prevent AKI and promote urinary excretion of myoglobin. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that can help increase urine output and reduce the risk of AKI.

Diazepam (A) may be used to treat benzodiazepine withdrawal, but it is not the primary concern in this scenario. Electroencephalography (B) may be useful in evaluating the patient's altered mental status, but it is not the best next step in management. Phenytoin (D) is an anticonvulsant medication that is not indicated in this scenario. Supportive therapy and observation (E) are important, but they should be combined with active management of the patient's rhabdomyolysis and risk of AKI.

It is essential to note that the patient should be closely monitored for signs of AKI, and further management may involve consultation with a nephrologist and potential dialysis.",Success
"A 47-year-old woman presents to a physician for evaluation of vomiting and diarrhea for 2 days. Her symptoms began following a company picnic a few days ago. Initially, she was unable to tolerate any solids or liquids by mouth, but now has been able to drink sips of water. She had a mild headache, which was relieved with acetaminophen. The past medical history is unremarkable. She does not take any medications. The blood pressure is 120/60 mm Hg and the heart rate is 60/min. On examination, the mucous membranes are dry and the eyes are slightly sunken. Where is most of the sodium reabsorbed in this patient’s kidneys?",D,"The correct answer is D. Proximal tubule.

In this scenario, the patient is experiencing vomiting and diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. The kidneys play a crucial role in regulating sodium levels in the body. In the kidneys, sodium reabsorption occurs primarily in the proximal tubule, where approximately 60-70% of the filtered sodium is reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. This process is essential for maintaining sodium homeostasis and blood pressure.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Collecting duct: While some sodium reabsorption occurs in the collecting duct, it is a minor contributor compared to the proximal tubule.

B. Distal tubule: The distal tubule is involved in fine-tuning sodium reabsorption, but it is not the primary site.

C. Descending limb of loop of Henle: This segment is primarily involved in water reabsorption, not sodium reabsorption.

E. Ascending limb of loop of Henle: This segment is involved in sodium and chloride reabsorption, but it is not the primary site of sodium reabsorption.

In dehydration, the kidneys will attempt to conserve sodium by increasing reabsorption in the proximal tubule, which is why option D is the correct answer.",Success
"A one-week-old boy presents with yellow sclerae, severe lethargy, and decreased muscle tone. His mother notes that the symptoms started shortly after birth and have been progressively worsening. The patient is breast fed and takes no medications. His labs are within normal limits with the exception of his liver function tests as follows:

ALT: 8 U/ L
AST: 10 U/L
Alkaline phosphatase: 50 U/L
Albumin: 3.7 g/dL
Total protein: 6.7 g/dL
Bilirubin, total: 29.4 mg/dL
Bilirubin, unconjugated: 29.2 mg/dL
Bilirubin, conjugated: 0.2 mg/dL

The boy is taken immediately for treatment. What is the most likely underlying cause of his condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Absence of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a significant elevation in total bilirubin (29.4 mg/dL) with a predominance of unconjugated bilirubin (29.2 mg/dL). This suggests a defect in bilirubin conjugation, which is the process by which bilirubin is converted into a water-soluble form that can be excreted into the bile.

UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 (UGT1A1) is the enzyme responsible for conjugating bilirubin in the liver. A deficiency or absence of this enzyme would lead to a buildup of unconjugated bilirubin, resulting in hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice.

Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a complete absence of UGT1A1 activity, leading to severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice. The symptoms described in the question, including yellow sclerae, lethargy, and decreased muscle tone, are consistent with this condition.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's laboratory results and symptoms:

A. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a genetic disorder that can cause hemolytic anemia, but it is not typically associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

C. Ankyrin protein alterations are associated with certain types of anemia, but not with bilirubin metabolism or conjugation defects.

D. Reduced UGT1A1 activity can cause Gilbert syndrome, a mild form of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are more consistent with a complete absence of UGT1A1 activity, as seen in Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I.

E. Glucocerebrosidase deficiency is associated with Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder that affects the metabolism of glucocerebrosides, but it is not related to bilirubin metabolism or conjugation defects.",Success
"A researcher is conducting an experiment on the mouse kidney to study the relative concentrations between the tubular fluid and plasma of a number of substances along the proximal convoluted tubule. Based on the graph shown in figure A, which of the following best describes the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea?",B,"Based on the graph shown in figure A, the correct answer is C. 

Here's why: 

The graph shows the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of various substances along the proximal convoluted tubule. The curve for urea (C) remains close to 1.0, indicating that the concentration of urea in the tubular fluid is similar to that in the plasma throughout the proximal convoluted tubule. This suggests that urea is not significantly reabsorbed or secreted in the proximal convoluted tubule, and its concentration in the tubular fluid remains relatively constant and equal to that in the plasma.

In contrast, the other options do not accurately describe the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea. Option A shows a rapid decrease in concentration, option B shows a gradual increase, option D shows a rapid increase, and option E shows a gradual decrease. None of these patterns match the observed curve for urea in the graph.",Success
"A 62-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of right-sided back pain, nausea, and dark urine. He reports alternating episodes of decreased urine output followed by a temporary increase in urine output for the past 2 days. In the past year, he has had two urinary tract infections. He has Crohn disease and underwent a small bowel resection 5 years ago. He currently takes mesalamine and a multivitamin. His father had recurrent kidney stones. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows right costovertebral angle tenderness. Urinalysis shows 70 RBC/hpf and envelope-shaped crystals. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a 6-mm stone in the proximal right ureter and two 4-mm stones in the left kidney. Which of the following factors has most likely contributed most to this patient’s current condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Malabsorption of fatty acids.

The patient's symptoms, such as right-sided back pain, nausea, and dark urine, are consistent with a kidney stone. The presence of envelope-shaped crystals in the urinalysis suggests that the stones are composed of oxalate. The CT scan confirms the presence of a 6-mm stone in the proximal right ureter and two 4-mm stones in the left kidney.

The patient's history of Crohn disease and small bowel resection 5 years ago is significant. Malabsorption of fatty acids, particularly fat-soluble vitamins, is a common complication of Crohn disease and small bowel resection. Oxalate absorption is increased in the presence of malabsorbed fatty acids, leading to an increased risk of oxalate kidney stones.

Option A, parathyroid gland adenoma, can cause hypercalcemia, which can increase the risk of kidney stones, but it is not the most likely contributor in this case.

Option B, excess vitamin D, can also increase the risk of kidney stones by increasing calcium absorption, but there is no indication of vitamin D excess in this patient.

Option C, recurrent urinary tract infections, may increase the risk of kidney stones, but it is not the primary cause of oxalate kidney stones in this patient.

Option E, high urine pH, is not a risk factor for oxalate kidney stones. In fact, oxalate stones are more likely to form in acidic urine.

Therefore, the most likely contributor to this patient's current condition is malabsorption of fatty acids due to Crohn disease and small bowel resection, leading to increased oxalate absorption and kidney stone formation.",Success

There are multiple papular elevations at the base of hair follicles and darkening of the palmar and plantar creases. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Ichthyosis vulgaris.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with ichthyosis vulgaris, a common genetic disorder of cornification. The characteristics that support this diagnosis include:

1. Generalized fine scales with coarse skin all over the body, except in the skin creases of the neck and in the cubital and popliteal fossae. This is a classic distribution pattern for ichthyosis vulgaris.
2. Multiple papular elevations at the base of hair follicles, which are known as keratotic papules.
3. Darkening of the palmar and plantar creases, which is a common finding in ichthyosis vulgaris.
4. The patient's age and the fact that the condition has been present since infancy, which is consistent with the typical age of onset for ichthyosis vulgaris.
5. The seasonal variation, with worsening in winter and improvement in summer, which is also characteristic of ichthyosis vulgaris.

Psoriasis (Option A) typically presents with thick, scaly plaques, often with redness and itching, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Lichen simplex (Option B) is a localized skin condition characterized by thickening of the skin, usually in response to chronic rubbing or scratching, which does not fit the patient's generalized skin involvement. Pityriasis versicolor (Option D) is a fungal infection that causes patches of discolored skin, often on the trunk and arms, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

The abdomen is nontender, the uterus is consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is in a cephalic presentation. There are traces of blood on the vulva and the introitus. Speculum examination shows a tender, bruised cervix, with a closed cervical os. Fetal heart rate is 166/min and CTG shows a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall. What is the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding?",C,"The correct answer is C. Cervical trauma.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest cervical trauma as the most likely cause of her antepartum bleeding. The presence of a tender, bruised cervix, traces of blood on the vulva and introitus, and a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing support this diagnosis. The patient's recent resumption of sexual activity at 22 weeks' gestation increases the likelihood of cervical trauma.

Option A, pedunculated cervical growth, is unlikely as there is no mention of a visible cervical lesion or growth. Option B, inflammation of the cervix, is also unlikely as there is no mention of any signs of infection, such as fever, purulent discharge, or cervical motion tenderness. Option D, fetal vessels overlying the cervical os, is not a common cause of antepartum bleeding and is not supported by the ultrasound findings. Option E, premature separation of the placenta, is unlikely as the ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall, which suggests a normally implanted placenta.

Urinalysis is positive for ketone bodies. What is the most appropriate immediate step in the management of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Administer IV fluids and insulin.

The patient is presenting with symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of diabetes. The diagnosis is supported by the following:

* High blood glucose level (691 mg/dL)
* Presence of ketone bodies in the urine
* Metabolic acidosis (pH 7.21, low bicarbonate level)
* Dehydration (shallow and rapid respirations, fatigue, poor skin turgor)
* Fruity breath odor (indicative of ketosis)

The immediate management of DKA involves correcting dehydration and hyperglycemia. Administering IV fluids and insulin is the most appropriate step. IV fluids will help to rehydrate the patient, reduce blood glucose levels, and correct electrolyte imbalances. Insulin will help to lower blood glucose levels and reduce ketone production.

The other options are not correct because:

* B. Administering IV antibiotics is not necessary at this point, as there is no indication of infection.
* C. Administering IV fluids with oral antidiabetic medications is not appropriate for DKA management, as oral medications may not be effective in this emergency situation.
* D. Administering IV bicarbonate is not recommended as a first-line treatment for DKA, as it may worsen the underlying acid-base imbalance.
* E. Administering potassium and magnesium may be necessary later in the treatment course, but it is not the most immediate priority.

His breath sounds are equal and full bilaterally and has weak distal pulses.

Which of the following is most likely to be found in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is A. Holosystolic, high-pitched blowing murmur at the lower left sternal border.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with an aortic dissection, which is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. The patient's history of a heart murmur, tall stature, and joint hypermobility suggest that he may have Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue and increases the risk of aortic dissection.

The physical examination findings of weak distal pulses and a murmur at the lower left sternal border are consistent with aortic regurgitation, which is a common complication of aortic dissection. A holosystolic, high-pitched blowing murmur at the lower left sternal border is characteristic of aortic regurgitation.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

* Option B is consistent with mitral valve prolapse, which is not likely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

They try to ask her what is wrong, but she does not respond and persists crying for approximately 20 minutes, after which she goes back to sleeping comfortably. Upon awaking the following morning, she has no recollection of the night's events. Which of the following is true about these episodes?",B,"The correct answer is B. They occur only during non-REM sleep.

The symptoms described in the question are consistent with night terrors, also known as sleep terrors. Night terrors are a type of parasomnia, a group of sleep disorders that involve abnormal movements or behaviors during sleep. They typically occur during the first third of the night, when the child is in a stage of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.

Night terrors are characterized by sudden episodes of screaming, crying, and thrashing about, often accompanied by a sense of fear or panic. The child may appear to be awake, but they are actually still asleep and unresponsive to their surroundings. The episodes usually last for a few minutes to half an hour, and the child often returns to a normal sleep pattern afterwards.

The other options are incorrect:

A. Night terrors are generally a childhood phenomenon and tend to resolve on their own as the child grows older. They are not typically persistent into adulthood.

C. Night terrors occur specifically during NREM sleep, not during any time of the sleep cycle.

D. There is no association between night terrors and child abuse.

E. While night terrors can be distressing for parents, there is no clear association between night terrors and the later development of a mood disorder.

It's worth noting that night terrors are different from nightmares, which occur during REM sleep and are often accompanied by vivid dreams and a sense of fear or anxiety. Nightmares are more common in adults and older children, and are often associated with psychological or emotional distress.",Success
"An 18-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a pruritic rash on her back for the past 2 hours. This morning, she started a course of ceftriaxone for treatment of pyelonephritis. A photograph of the rash is shown. This patient's skin findings are most likely associated with which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is E. Mast cell activation in subcutaneous tissues.

The patient's skin findings, as shown in the photograph, are consistent with urticaria, also known as hives. Urticaria is a common allergic reaction that appears as itchy, raised, and erythematous patches or wheals on the skin. The rash is likely an allergic reaction to the ceftriaxone, which the patient started taking for pyelonephritis.

Mast cell activation in subcutaneous tissues is the underlying mechanism of urticaria. When mast cells are activated, they release histamine and other chemical mediators, leading to increased permeability of blood vessels, vasodilation, and increased mucus production. This results in the characteristic wheals and itching associated with urticaria.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's skin findings:

A. Perivascular cutaneous polymorphonuclear infiltration is more consistent with a diagnosis of vasculitis, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and photograph.

B. Direct tissue damage by irradiated antibiotic agent is not a plausible explanation, as ceftriaxone is not an irradiated antibiotic, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with tissue damage.

C. Cytotoxic T-cell destruction of antigen-tagged cells is a mechanism involved in cell-mediated immune responses, but it is not directly related to the patient's urticarial rash.

D. Hyperpermeability of superficial dermal microvasculature may contribute to the development of urticaria, but it is not the primary underlying mechanism.

Therefore, option E, Mast cell activation in subcutaneous tissues, is the most likely explanation for the patient's skin findings.",Success
"Two hours after admission to the hospital for dialysis, a 63-year-old woman has severe pain in her lower back. The pain is 8 out of 10 in intensity and radiates down the legs. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 4 years ago. She has hypertension, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and major depressive disorder. She lives with her daughter and reports frequent fights with her at home. Her current medications include sertraline, insulin, enalapril, sodium bicarbonate, and sevelamer. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 132/94 mm Hg. There is severe tenderness on palpation over the L2 vertebra; range of motion is limited. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL
Leukocyte count 8,700/mm3
Platelet count 130,000/mm3

Na+ 136 mEq/L
Cl- 101 mEq/L
K+ 5.1 mEq/L
Calcium 8.2 mg/dL
Urea nitrogen 33 mg/dL
Glucose 190 mg/dL
Creatinine 3.8 mg/dL
An x-ray of the spine shows a wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Here's why:

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated potassium level (5.1 mEq/L) and an elevated creatinine level (3.8 mg/dL), indicating chronic kidney disease. The patient is also undergoing dialysis, which further supports this diagnosis. In patients with chronic kidney disease, the kidneys are unable to effectively remove phosphate from the blood, leading to hyperphosphatemia. This, in turn, can cause a decrease in calcium levels, stimulating the parathyroid glands to produce more parathyroid hormone (PTH). Elevated PTH levels can lead to bone resorption, causing osteoporosis and increasing the risk of compression fractures, such as the wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra seen in this patient.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a common complication of chronic kidney disease, and it is characterized by elevated PTH levels in response to hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia.

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism (Option A) occurs when a parathyroid gland becomes autonomous and continues to produce excessive amounts of PTH even after the underlying cause has been treated. This is not the most likely explanation for this patient's findings.

Elder abuse (Option C) is not supported by the patient's history or physical examination.

Pseudohypoparathyroidism (Option D) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by resistance to PTH, leading to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. This is not consistent with the patient's laboratory results.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (Option E) is a condition in which one or more parathyroid glands become overactive and produce excessive amounts of PTH, leading to hypercalcemia. This is not consistent with the patient's laboratory results, which show a normal calcium level.",Success
"A 50-year-old man comes to the physician because of swelling of his legs for 2 months. Three months ago, he was diagnosed with hypertension and started on a new medication. His blood pressure is 145/95 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 2+ edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. This patient was most likely treated with which of the following drugs?",E,"The correct answer is E. Amlodipine.

Here's why:

The patient presents with swelling in both lower extremities (bilateral edema), which is a common side effect of calcium channel blockers like amlodipine. Amlodipine is a medication commonly used to treat hypertension, which is consistent with the patient's diagnosis three months prior.

The other options are less likely:

A. Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, which is not typically associated with edema as a side effect.

B. Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which can cause angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat) but is not typically associated with bilateral leg edema.

C. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which is often used to treat conditions like heart failure or hypertension, but it is not typically associated with edema as a side effect.

D. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic, which would actually help reduce edema, not cause it.

Amlodipine, on the other hand, is known to cause peripheral edema in some patients, particularly at higher doses. This is due to its vasodilatory effects, which can lead to increased fluid retention and swelling in the legs.",Success
An investigator is studying the function of different enzymes in various human cell types. A subset of normal human cells with an elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase is harvested and isolated. Which of the following is most likely to be absent in these cells?,A,"The correct answer is D. Lactic acid dehydrogenase.

Bisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme involved in the glycolytic pathway, specifically in the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Elevated levels of bisphosphoglycerate mutase would suggest that the cells are favoring the glycolytic pathway and producing more 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate.

Lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, which is the final step of anaerobic glycolysis. In cells with elevated bisphosphoglycerate mutase, it is likely that the cells are producing more 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and less pyruvate, which would reduce the need for LDH. Therefore, LDH is the most likely enzyme to be absent or reduced in these cells.

The other options are not directly related to the glycolytic pathway or the function of bisphosphoglycerate mutase:

A. α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is an enzyme involved in the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle).

B. Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme involved in the glycolytic pathway, but it catalyzes a different reaction than bisphosphoglycerate mutase.

C. Glutathione reductase is an enzyme involved in the antioxidant defense system and has no direct relation to the glycolytic pathway.

E. Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme involved in the regulation of pH and has no direct relation to the glycolytic pathway.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Lactic acid dehydrogenase.",Success
"A 28-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room after a motor vehicle accident. On arrival, she is stable and says that she hit a car at an intersection that ""came out of nowhere"". She states that she had similar close encounters with other cars these past few weeks but was able to avoid collisions with those. She has also had intermittent headaches over the last month and has noticed that her shirts have been getting wet unexpectedly. Blood tests reveal an abnormal elevation of a circulating substance. Which of following changes is also associated with the physiologic function of the most likely substance in this case?",B,"The correct answer is D. Increased human chorionic gonadotropin.

Based on the patient's symptoms, particularly the intermittent headaches and unexpected wetting of shirts (suggesting galactorrhea, or spontaneous milk production), it is likely that the elevated circulating substance is prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates milk production in lactating women.

The association with the motor vehicle accidents and close encounters suggests that the patient may have had decreased peripheral vision, which is a common symptom of pituitary tumors, specifically prolactinomas. These tumors can cause hyperprolactinemia, leading to galactorrhea, headaches, and visual field defects.

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is often elevated in pregnancy, which can also cause hyperprolactinemia. In pregnant women, hCG stimulates the production of prolactin, leading to milk production in preparation for lactation. Therefore, increased hCG is associated with the physiologic function of prolactin.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the physiologic function of prolactin:

A. Decreased oxytocin is not associated with the symptoms described.

B. Decreased progesterone is not related to the patient's symptoms or prolactin function.

C. Increased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is not directly related to prolactin or the patient's symptoms.

E. Increased progesterone is not directly associated with the patient's symptoms or prolactin function, although it may be elevated in pregnancy, which can cause hyperprolactinemia. However, the correct answer is D, increased hCG, which is more specifically associated with the physiologic function of prolactin in this case.",Success
"A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of episodic headaches associated with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Over-the-counter pain medications have failed to reduce her symptoms. An MRI of the brain shows isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle. This dilatation is most likely caused by blockade of which of the following structures?",B,"The correct answer is B. Interventricular foramen.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as episodic headaches, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, are consistent with increased intracranial pressure, which can be caused by a blockage in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathway. The MRI finding of isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle suggests that the blockage is occurring at the level of the interventricular foramen (also known as the foramen of Monro).

The interventricular foramen is a narrow channel that connects the lateral ventricle to the third ventricle, allowing CSF to flow from the lateral ventricle into the third ventricle. If this foramen becomes blocked, CSF can accumulate in the lateral ventricle, leading to its dilation.

The other options are not directly related to the blockage causing the dilation of the left lateral ventricle:

A. Arachnoid villi are small projections of the arachnoid mater that allow CSF to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Blockage of arachnoid villi would not cause dilation of the lateral ventricle.

C. The median aperture (also known as the foramen of Magendie) is a small opening in the roof of the fourth ventricle that allows CSF to flow into the subarachnoid space. Blockage of this aperture would affect the flow of CSF from the fourth ventricle, not the lateral ventricle.

D. Lateral apertures (also known as the foramina of Luschka) are small openings in the lateral walls of the fourth ventricle that allow CSF to flow into the subarachnoid space. Like the median aperture, blockage of these apertures would affect the flow of CSF from the fourth ventricle, not the lateral ventricle.

E. The cerebral aqueduct (also known as the aqueduct of Sylvius) is a narrow channel that connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle, allowing CSF to flow from the third ventricle into the fourth ventricle. Blockage of the cerebral aqueduct would affect the flow of CSF between the third and fourth ventricles, not the lateral ventricle.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Interventricular foramen.",Success
"A 20-day-old child is brought to the emergency department by her parents. They are concerned about lethargy and easy bruising. Her mother reports that she has been eating less for the past few days. Today she was difficult to arouse. She normally nurses four-five times a day, but ate less yesterday and this morning. The girl was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery at home with minimal prenatal or postnatal care. This is her first visit to a physician of any type. The family is carefully questioned and child abuse is ruled out. The daughter’s pulse is 97/min, respirations are 35/min, temperature is 35.8°C (96.4°F), and blood pressure is 71/46 mm Hg. Physical examination shows diffuse petechiae and bruising. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",E,"The correct answer is E. Vitamin K deficiency.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, particularly the easy bruising and petechiae, suggest a bleeding disorder. The lack of prenatal and postnatal care, combined with the home birth, increases the likelihood of vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting, and newborns are at risk of deficiency due to limited transfer of vitamin K from the mother during pregnancy and low levels in breast milk.

Vitamin K deficiency bleeding (VKDB) typically occurs in the first few weeks of life, and the symptoms can range from mild bruising to severe bleeding. The patient's presentation, including lethargy, poor feeding, and easy bruising, is consistent with VKDB.

The other options are less likely:

A. Group B streptococcus (GBS) infection: While GBS infection can cause sepsis and bleeding, it is less likely to present with isolated bleeding symptoms. Additionally, the patient's temperature is low, which is not typical of GBS infection.

B. Hepatitis B infection: Hepatitis B is not typically associated with bleeding disorders or petechiae in newborns.

C. Thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency: Hypothyroidism can cause lethargy, but it is not typically associated with bleeding disorders or petechiae.

D. Vitamin D deficiency: Vitamin D deficiency is associated with rickets and bone abnormalities, not bleeding disorders.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends vitamin K administration at birth to prevent VKDB. In this case, the lack of prenatal and postnatal care, combined with the home birth, likely contributed to the patient's vitamin K deficiency.",Success
"A 10-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a generalized, non-itchy rash for 2 days. He has also had a fever and sore throat for 4 days. He has not received any routine childhood vaccinations. Examination shows a flushed face except around his mouth. A diffuse, papular, erythematous rash that blanches with pressure is seen over the trunk. Pharyngeal erythema and a red beefy tongue are noted. His leukocyte count is 11,200/mm3 (75% segmented neutrophils, 22% lymphocytes). Without treatment, this patient's current condition puts him at greatest risk for which of the following complications?",D,"The correct answer is B. Coronary artery aneurysms.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with Kawasaki disease, a vasculitis that primarily affects children. The diagnosis is supported by the presence of a fever, sore throat, and a characteristic rash, as well as the patient's age and lack of routine childhood vaccinations.

Kawasaki disease is a leading cause of acquired heart disease in children, and if left untreated, it can lead to serious cardiovascular complications, including coronary artery aneurysms. These aneurysms can increase the risk of myocardial infarction, heart failure, and even death.

The other options are not directly related to Kawasaki disease or its complications:

A. Hemolytic anemia is a condition characterized by the destruction of red blood cells, which is not typically associated with Kawasaki disease.

C. Encephalitis is a serious neurological condition that can be caused by various factors, including infections, but it is not a common complication of Kawasaki disease.

D. Mitral valve regurgitation is a heart valve disorder that can be caused by various conditions, including rheumatic fever, but it is not a direct complication of Kawasaki disease.

E. Minimal change disease is a type of kidney disease that can cause nephrotic syndrome, but it is not related to Kawasaki disease or its complications.

It's essential to note that prompt treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin can significantly reduce the risk of coronary artery aneurysms and other cardiovascular complications in patients with Kawasaki disease.",Success
"A 32-year-old man presents to the emergency department with fever, nausea, and vomiting. The patient states that his symptoms started last night and have persisted to this morning. He has a past medical history of asthma, and his current medications include albuterol and fluticasone. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 110/60 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, the patient seems uncomfortable. He requests that the lights in the room stay turned off during the physical exam. The patient's cardiac exam demonstrates a normal rate and rhythm, and his pulmonary exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Musculoskeletal exam reveals diminished mobility of the neck in all four directions, with flexion of the neck causing the patient discomfort. Lumbar puncture is performed and results are seen below.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF):
Cell count: 175/mm^3
Cl-: 119 mEq/L
Glucose: 49 mg/dL
Pressure: 150 mmH2O
Total protein: 55 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient's most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is C. Ceftriaxene.

Based on the patient's symptoms and the results of the lumbar puncture, the most likely diagnosis is bacterial meningitis. The CSF analysis shows an elevated cell count (175/mm^3), which indicates inflammation or infection. The low glucose level (49 mg/dL) and elevated protein level (55 mg/dL) are also consistent with bacterial meningitis.

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, nausea, vomiting, and photophobia (sensitivity to light), are also consistent with meningitis. The diminished mobility of the neck in all four directions and discomfort with flexion of the neck are indicative of meningeal irritation.

Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that is effective against a wide range of bacteria that can cause meningitis, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. It is a recommended first-line treatment for bacterial meningitis in adults.

Option A, acyclovir, is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections. While HSV and VZV can cause meningitis, the CSF analysis and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with bacterial meningitis.

Option B, amphotericin and 5-flucytosine, is a treatment regimen for fungal meningitis, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and CSF analysis.

Option D, ceftriaxone and vancomycin, may be used in some cases of bacterial meningitis, but vancomycin is typically added to cover for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or other resistant organisms. In this case, the patient's symptoms and CSF analysis do not suggest MRSA or other resistant organisms.

Option E, IV fluids and monitoring, is not a specific treatment for bacterial meningitis and would not be sufficient to manage the patient's condition.

Therefore, the best treatment for this patient's most likely diagnosis is ceftriaxone.",Success

A photograph of his oral mucosa is shown. Indirect mirror examination of the posterior oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Nystatin.

The patient's symptoms and oral mucosa appearance are consistent with oral thrush (candidiasis), a common fungal infection. The white patches on the tongue and oral mucosa are characteristic of this condition. The patient's use of a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone) increases the risk of developing oral thrush.

Nystatin is an antifungal medication commonly used to treat oral thrush. It is available in various forms, including lozenges, pastilles, and oral suspension.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Azithromycin is an antibiotic, which would not be effective against a fungal infection like oral thrush.

B. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication, but it is not the best choice for oral thrush. While it can be used to treat oral thrush, nystatin is generally preferred due to its topical application and lower risk of systemic side effects.

C. Isotretinoin is a medication used to treat severe acne and is not indicated for oral thrush.

E. Penicillin V is an antibiotic, which would not be effective against a fungal infection like oral thrush.

It's essential to note that the patient's asthma and use of inhaled corticosteroids may require monitoring and adjustment of their asthma treatment plan to prevent recurrence of oral thrush.",Success
"A 56-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, chills, nausea, and flank pain.

One week ago, she was discharged from the hospital after treatment for a multiple sclerosis flare. Her temperature is 39.3°C (102.8°C). Physical examination shows marked tenderness in the right costovertebral area. Urine cultures grow a non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-positive, gram-negative rod. The causal organism of this patient's current condition most likely produces which of the following substances?",E,"The correct answer is C. Urease.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a diagnosis of pyelonephritis, which is an infection of the kidney. The presence of a chronic indwelling bladder catheter increases the risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The growth of a non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-positive, gram-negative rod in the urine culture is consistent with Proteus mirabilis, a common cause of UTIs in patients with indwelling catheters.

Proteus mirabilis produces urease, an enzyme that breaks down urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. This enzyme is responsible for the alkalization of the urine, which can lead to the formation of struvite stones. Urease production is a key virulence factor for Proteus mirabilis and is often associated with UTIs and kidney stones.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Lipoteichoic acid is a component of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria, not gram-negative rods like Proteus mirabilis.

B. K capsule is a type of capsule produced by Klebsiella pneumoniae, a different type of gram-negative bacterium.

D. Toxin B is a toxin produced by Clostridioides difficile, which is not typically associated with UTIs or pyelonephritis.

E. Pyoverdine is a siderophore produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a gram-negative bacterium that is not typically associated with UTIs or pyelonephritis.

Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30.

The photomicrograph of the resected cervical lymph node specimen shows a characteristic ""starry sky"" pattern, which is consistent with a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma. Specifically, the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are large, abnormal lymphocytes, is a hallmark of Hodgkin lymphoma.

CD15 and CD30 are two markers that are commonly used to diagnose Hodgkin lymphoma. Reed-Sternberg cells typically stain positive for these markers, which helps to distinguish Hodgkin lymphoma from other types of lymphoma.

"A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of nausea for the last two weeks. During this period, she has had increased urinary frequency and fatigue. She also reports two episodes of non-bloody vomiting. There is no personal history of serious illness. Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago. Physical examination shows bilateral breast tenderness. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is positive. Which of the following is the most accurate predictor of the gestational age?",D,"The correct answer is D. Crown-rump length.

The patient's symptoms, such as nausea, urinary frequency, and fatigue, are consistent with early pregnancy. The positive urine pregnancy test confirms the diagnosis. To determine the gestational age, various ultrasound measurements can be used.

Crown-rump length (CRL) is the most accurate predictor of gestational age, especially between 7-12 weeks of gestation. It measures the length of the embryo or fetus from the top of the head (crown) to the bottom of the rump. CRL has a high correlation with gestational age, with an accuracy of ±3-4 days.

In contrast, the other options are not as accurate or are used at different stages of pregnancy:

A. Ratio of head to abdominal circumference: This measurement is used later in pregnancy, around 20-24 weeks, to assess fetal growth and development.

B. Serum β-hCG levels: While β-hCG levels can be used to detect pregnancy and monitor its progression, they are not a reliable indicator of gestational age.

C. Femoral length: This measurement is used later in pregnancy, around 20-24 weeks, to assess fetal growth and development.

E. Biparietal length: This measurement is used later in pregnancy, around 20-24 weeks, to assess fetal growth and development.

A 2.5-cm (1-inch) epigastric mass is palpated. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis is within normal limits. Further diagnostic evaluation of the patient is most likely to show which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is D. Elongated and thickened pylorus on abdominal ultrasound.

The patient's symptoms, such as recurrent nonbilious vomiting, irritability during feeding, and refusal to finish the bottle, are consistent with a diagnosis of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS). The palpation of a 2.5-cm epigastric mass further supports this diagnosis. HPS is a common condition in infants, particularly in those with Down syndrome, and is characterized by thickening of the pyloric muscle, which obstructs the passage of food from the stomach into the small intestine.

Abdominal ultrasound is the diagnostic modality of choice for HPS, and it typically shows an elongated and thickened pylorus. This is in contrast to other options:

A. A dilated colon segment on abdominal x-ray would be more consistent with a diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease or other conditions causing intestinal obstruction.

B. A high serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration would be indicative of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

C. Detection of rotavirus antigen on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) would suggest a diagnosis of rotavirus gastroenteritis, which is not consistent with the patient's nonbilious vomiting and palpable epigastric mass.

E. A triple bubble sign on abdominal x-ray would be more consistent with a diagnosis of intestinal obstruction, such as duodenal atresia or jejunal atresia, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 105/60 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 18/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). The physical examination is mostly normal except for her eye exam as presented in the image below. Which of the following statements is true regarding treatment of this patient’s condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. The child should be administered a single dose of oral azithromycin.

Based on the symptoms and physical examination, the patient is likely suffering from trachoma, a chronic conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. The image shows the characteristic follicles on the upper tarsal conjunctiva, which is a hallmark of trachoma.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the recommended treatment for trachoma is a single dose of oral azithromycin (20 mg/kg). This is because azithromycin is effective against C. trachomatis and has a good safety profile.

Option A is incorrect because the patient has a known allergy to cephalosporins, which makes them contraindicated.

Option B is incorrect because topical bacitracin is not effective against C. trachomatis.

Option C is incorrect because oral tetracycline is not recommended for children under 8 years old due to the risk of tooth discoloration.

Option E is incorrect because surgical resection is not a treatment option for trachoma.

It's worth noting that the patient's mother should also be evaluated and treated for trachoma, as it is often spread through close contact.

He was initially diagnosed with t(9;22)-positive acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia following workup for fatigue and pancytopenia. He is fully conscious. His blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), pulse is 98/min, and respiratory rate is 14/min. Physical examination including examination of the central venous catheter site shows no source of infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated. Which of the following factors about this patient most strongly indicates a poor prognosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Cytogenetics.

The patient's cytogenetics, specifically the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (t(9;22)), is a high-risk feature in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The Philadelphia chromosome is a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, which leads to the formation of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. This genetic abnormality is associated with a poorer prognosis in ALL, as it confers a higher risk of relapse and resistance to chemotherapy.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Age: While age can be a prognostic factor in ALL, with infants and adolescents having a poorer prognosis, the patient's age of 9 years is not a high-risk feature.

C. Fever and neutropenia: Fever and neutropenia are common complications of chemotherapy, and while they require prompt treatment, they do not necessarily indicate a poor prognosis.

D. Initial presentation: The patient's initial presentation with fatigue and pancytopenia is a common presentation for ALL, but it does not provide information about the prognosis.

E. Immunological subtype: The patient's immunological subtype is T cell ALL, which is a more aggressive subtype than B cell ALL. However, the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome is a stronger predictor of poor prognosis than the immunological subtype.

According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome is a high-risk feature in ALL, and patients with this cytogenetic abnormality are typically considered high-risk and may require more intensive therapy.",Success
"A 45-year-old homeless man comes to the emergency department because of progressive neck pain for 3 days. He also reports headaches and numbness in both hands. Over the past 4 months, he has had intermittent lower back pain after waking up. The back pain improves with movement. He also has recurrent episodes of gout in the metatarsophalangeal joint of his right big toe. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years and drinks four beers daily. The patient is a known user of intravenous heroin. He appears acutely ill. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg. There are several track marks on both forearms. Examination of the neck shows warmth, erythema, and limited range of motion. Gentle palpation over the midcervical spinal processes causes severe pain.

Segmented neutrophils 77%
Eosinophils 1%
Lymphocytes 20%
Monocytes 2%
Platelet count 278,000/mm3

Blood cultures are pending. An x-ray of the cervical spine shows no abnormalities. An MRI of the spine shows signs of inflammation. A bone biopsy confirms the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",B,"The correct answer is C. Surgical debridement.

The patient's presentation, laboratory results, and imaging studies suggest a diagnosis of spinal osteomyelitis, which is a bacterial infection of the spine. The patient's symptoms, such as neck pain, headaches, and numbness in both hands, are consistent with this diagnosis. The MRI of the spine showing signs of inflammation and the bone biopsy confirming the diagnosis further support this conclusion.

Surgical debridement is the most appropriate next step in management because it allows for the removal of infected tissue and bone, which is essential for treating spinal osteomyelitis. Antibiotic therapy alone may not be sufficient to eradicate the infection, and surgical debridement can help to reduce the risk of complications, such as abscess formation and neurological deficits.

Option A, lumbar puncture, is not indicated in this case because the patient's symptoms and imaging studies suggest a diagnosis of spinal osteomyelitis, which is not typically diagnosed with a lumbar puncture.

Option B, intravenous ciprofloxacin and vancomycin therapy, may be part of the treatment plan, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Antibiotic therapy should be guided by the results of blood cultures and sensitivity testing, and surgical debridement should be performed as soon as possible to remove the source of infection.

Option D, oral indomethacin therapy, is not indicated in this case because it is not an effective treatment for spinal osteomyelitis.

Option E, bone scintigraphy, may be a useful diagnostic tool in some cases of spinal osteomyelitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. The diagnosis has already been confirmed with a bone biopsy, and surgical debridement is the most important step in treating the infection.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of intravenous drug use and recurrent episodes of gout may have contributed to his increased risk of developing spinal osteomyelitis.",Success
"A 1-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department with persistent vomiting, dehydration, and irritability. Over the past week, she has been projectile vomiting after most feedings. Initially, the vomiting would occur just once or twice a day, but now it occurs after every feed. However, her appetite hasn’t decreased, and she seeks milk right after each episode of vomiting. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is breastfed exclusively. On physical exam, the vital signs include: temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), blood pressure 85/55 mm Hg, respiratory rate 28/min, and heart rate 150/min. On examination, she appears to be mildly dehydrated, listless, and irritable. Her abdomen is soft and nontender with a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region. Which of the following acid-base disturbances is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the projectile vomiting and palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region, are consistent with pyloric stenosis. This condition is a common cause of vomiting in infants, particularly in the first few months of life.

Pyloric stenosis leads to a loss of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and chloride ions in the vomitus, resulting in a metabolic alkalosis. The body compensates for this loss by increasing bicarbonate production, which further exacerbates the alkalosis.

The other options are not directly related to pyloric stenosis:

A. Respiratory alkalosis is typically seen in conditions such as respiratory failure, anxiety, or fever, which are not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

B. Metabolic acidosis is more commonly associated with conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, or renal failure, which are not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

D. Respiratory acidosis is typically seen in conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, or respiratory failure, which are not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

E. Mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis is a complex acid-base disturbance that is not typically associated with pyloric stenosis.

It's essential to note that the diagnosis of pyloric stenosis is typically confirmed with imaging studies, such as ultrasound or barium swallow, and treatment involves surgical intervention to relieve the obstruction.",Success
"A 10-year-old girl is brought to a clinic by her parents after 1 week of difficulty breathing, dry cough, and low-grade fevers. She has also developed shallow erythematous ulcers inside of her mouth. There is no history of chills, rigors, or headaches. Her appetite has decreased. The girl has been HIV-positive since birth and is being treated with HAART. Her baseline viral load is <50/mL. On general examination, the girl appears ill. Diffuse inspiratory crackles are heard on chest auscultation with normal heart sounds. No lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly is noted on physical examination. A blood sample is drawn, which shows a CD4 count of 100/mm3 and a viral load of 25,050/mL. What is the most likely mechanism responsible for the lack of responsiveness to therapy?",D,"The correct answer is D. pol gene mutation.

The patient's symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, dry cough, and low-grade fevers, are consistent with a respiratory infection. The presence of shallow erythematous ulcers inside the mouth suggests oral candidiasis, which is an opportunistic infection common in HIV-positive individuals with low CD4 counts. The patient's CD4 count of 100/mm3 and viral load of 25,050/mL indicate that the patient is not responding to Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART).

The most likely mechanism responsible for the lack of responsiveness to therapy is the development of resistance to antiretroviral medications. This is often due to mutations in the pol gene, which codes for the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme. Mutations in the pol gene can lead to resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs), which are commonly used in HAART regimens.

Option A, ineffective CD8 cytotoxicity, is not directly related to the lack of responsiveness to HAART. CD8 cells play a role in immune surveillance, but their cytotoxicity is not a primary mechanism of antiretroviral therapy.

Option B, gag gene mutation, is not typically associated with resistance to HAART. The gag gene codes for the HIV capsid protein, and mutations in this gene are more related to HIV replication and assembly rather than resistance to antiretroviral medications.

Option C, env gene mutation, can lead to resistance to entry inhibitors, but it is not the primary mechanism responsible for the lack of responsiveness to HAART in this patient.

Option E, decreased viral replication, is not a mechanism of resistance to HAART. In fact, the patient's high viral load suggests that the virus is actively replicating despite treatment.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. pol gene mutation, which is the most likely mechanism responsible for the lack of responsiveness to HAART in this patient.",Success
"A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department with confusion. The patient lives in a nursing home and has Alzheimer dementia at baseline. His nurse noticed that he was more confused than usual and was somnolent for the past 12 hours.

PTH: 8 pg/mL

The patient is referred to another physician for a more thorough workup including laboratory work and CT imaging. Which of the following is the best long-term prophylaxis for the cause of this patient’s acute symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Alendronate.

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the likely cause of his acute symptoms is hypercalcemia, which is not explicitly stated in the question but can be inferred from the patient's presentation and laboratory values.

The patient's symptoms of confusion, somnolence, and increased urinary frequency are consistent with hypercalcemia. The laboratory values also support this diagnosis, with a normal calcium level (12.2 mg/dL) but an elevated PTH (parathyroid hormone) level (8 pg/mL), which suggests primary hyperparathyroidism.

The best long-term prophylaxis for primary hyperparathyroidism is bisphosphonate therapy, specifically alendronate (Option A). Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption, reducing calcium levels and alleviating symptoms.

The other options are not correct:

B. Calcitonin is a hormone that can help lower calcium levels in the short term but is not a long-term prophylaxis for hyperparathyroidism.

C. Furosemide is a diuretic that can increase calcium excretion but is not a treatment for hyperparathyroidism.

D. IV fluids may be used to treat dehydration, which can exacerbate hypercalcemia, but it is not a long-term prophylaxis.

E. Teriparatide is a recombinant PTH used to treat osteoporosis, not hyperparathyroidism.

It's essential to note that the patient's underlying hyperparathyroidism should be further evaluated and treated, possibly with surgical intervention, to address the root cause of the problem.",Success
"A 68-year-old woman is referred to the outpatient psychiatry clinic from the medical clinic. The patient is being treated for urge incontinence but is being referred for psychiatric evaluation to help with some of her old avoidance behavior. For the 3 months that she had her urinary symptoms, she avoided places like long lines and long train rides. Even after being successfully treated for her urinary condition, she continues to show restricted social interaction. Which of the following is a true statement regarding the patient's condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. She fears not being able to escape similar situations.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with Avoidant Personality Disorder, but based on the description, a more likely diagnosis is Situational Phobia or Specific Phobia, formerly known as ""simple phobia."" The patient's avoidance behavior is specific to situations where she may not be able to easily access a bathroom due to her previous urinary symptoms. Even after successful treatment, she continues to exhibit restricted social interaction, suggesting that the fear of not being able to escape or access a bathroom has become a persistent phobic response.

Option A is correct because the patient's fear is centered around not being able to escape or access a bathroom in certain situations, which is a hallmark feature of Situational Phobia.

Option B is incorrect because, while the duration of symptoms is important in psychiatric diagnoses, there is no specific requirement for symptoms to last at least 1 month in Situational Phobia.

Option C is incorrect because, while the patient does exhibit avoidance behavior in specific situations, the diagnosis of Situational Phobia requires a pattern of avoidance behavior in response to a specific feared situation or object.

Option D is correct, but it's not the best answer. Patients with Situational Phobia may indeed have accompanying social phobia or other anxiety disorders.

Option E is incorrect because Situational Phobia does not always occur in the context of panic disorder. While there may be some overlap between the two conditions, they are distinct psychiatric diagnoses.",Success
"A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department with dyspnea and palpitations. He does not smoke cigarettes or consume alcohol, and past medical history is insignificant. Blood pressure is 115/75 mmHG and heart rate is 125/min. Heart rhythm is irregularly irregular. After initial treatment with IV digoxin the patient's heart rate drops to 85/min and remains irregular. Which of the following best explains the effect of digoxin in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Vagal stimulation.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest atrial fibrillation (AFib), which is a common cardiac arrhythmia characterized by an irregularly irregular heart rhythm. The patient's response to IV digoxin, with a decrease in heart rate to 85/min, is consistent with the medication's effects on the atrioventricular (AV) node.

Digoxin works by inhibiting the Na-K-ATPase pump in cardiac myocytes, which increases intracellular sodium and decreases intracellular potassium. This, in turn, increases the activity of the vagus nerve, which slows down the heart rate by increasing the refractory period of the AV node. As a result, the ventricular rate decreases, and the heart rhythm remains irregular due to the underlying AFib.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors is not a mechanism of action of digoxin. Beta blockers are a separate class of medications that work by blocking the effects of the sympathetic nervous system on the heart.

B. Calcium channel blockade is not a mechanism of action of digoxin. Calcium channel blockers are a separate class of medications that work by blocking the influx of calcium into cardiac myocytes, which slows down the heart rate and reduces blood pressure.

C. Blockade of Na-K-ATPase on cardiac myocytes is a mechanism of action of digoxin, but it's not the primary effect that explains the patient's response to the medication. The increased vagal tone is the primary mechanism that slows down the heart rate.

E. Increased ventricular contractility is not a primary effect of digoxin in this patient. While digoxin can increase contractility in certain situations, its primary effect in AFib is to slow down the ventricular rate by increasing vagal tone.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA), support the use of digoxin for rate control in AFib, and its mechanism of action is well-established in the medical literature.",Success
"Public health researchers are reviewing data from an outbreak of hepatitis A that was traced to contaminated produce from a popular restaurant. A case series investigation with prospective and retrospective follow-up found that 500 individuals dined at the restaurant during the week of study. The incidence of hepatitis A infection was found to be 25%, and the total number of deaths recorded among the incident cases was 5 individuals. What was the case-fatality rate for the hepatitis A outbreak?",A,"The correct answer is B. 5%.

To calculate the case-fatality rate, you need to know the number of deaths among the incident cases and the total number of incident cases.

In this scenario, the number of incident cases is the number of individuals who developed hepatitis A infection, which is 25% of 500, or:

500 x 0.25 = 125 incident cases

The number of deaths among the incident cases is 5.

The case-fatality rate is the proportion of deaths among the incident cases, calculated as:

Case-fatality rate = (Number of deaths / Number of incident cases) x 100
= (5 / 125) x 100
= 5 / 125 x 100
= 4%

On physical examination, the patient is drowsy but follows commands. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. The remainder of the initial examination is unremarkable. While the patient is being transferred to observation, his level of consciousness acutely declines. Repeat vital signs are significant for a blood pressure of 190/110 mm Hg. Ophthalmic examination now shows a fixed and dilated left pupil with no pupillary light reflex. A noncontrast CT of the head is performed and is shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Tearing of the middle meningeal artery.

The patient's presentation is consistent with an epidural hematoma, which is a type of traumatic brain injury. The initial normal vital signs and alertness, followed by a rapid decline in level of consciousness, are characteristic of an epidural hematoma. The fixed and dilated left pupil with no pupillary light reflex suggests compression of the oculomotor nerve (CN III) by the hematoma, which is a common finding in epidural hematomas.

The noncontrast CT of the head shows a lens-shaped hyperdensity, which is typical of an epidural hematoma. Epidural hematomas are usually caused by tearing of the middle meningeal artery, which is a branch of the external carotid artery that runs through the epidural space. This type of injury is often seen in traumatic brain injuries, particularly those involving a lateral impact, such as a motorcycle accident.

The other options are not supported by the patient's presentation and imaging findings:

B. Dural arteriovenous fistula is a rare condition that typically presents with a gradual onset of symptoms, not an acute decline in consciousness.

C. Tearing of bridging veins would more likely cause a subdural hematoma, which is typically crescent-shaped on CT imaging, not lens-shaped.

D. Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysm is a type of cerebral aneurysm that is not typically associated with traumatic brain injury.

E. Arteriovenous malformation is a congenital condition that may present with seizures or other neurological symptoms, but it is not typically associated with acute traumatic brain injury.

"A 42-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a follow-up visit. He has type 1 diabetes mellitus, for which he takes insulin. He complains of frequent episodes of waking up in the middle of his sleep. When he wakes up, he feels excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness. His morning blood glucose is high on repeated measurement. Which of the following is the optimal intervention for this patient condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Reducing daily insulin dose.

The patient's symptoms, such as waking up in the middle of the night with excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness, are indicative of nocturnal hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). This is likely caused by taking too much insulin, which is causing his blood sugar to drop too low during the night. The high morning blood glucose readings suggest that the patient's body is releasing stress hormones, such as cortisol and glucagon, to counteract the hypoglycemia, leading to a rebound hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) in the morning.

Reducing the daily insulin dose would help to prevent the nocturnal hypoglycemia and subsequent morning hyperglycemia. This is the optimal intervention because it addresses the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option A, reassurance, is not sufficient, as the patient's symptoms require medical attention and adjustment of his insulin regimen.

Option B, adding diazepam, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms and would not address the underlying cause of nocturnal hypoglycemia.

Option C, adding pramlintide, is an amylin analog that is used to help regulate blood sugar levels, but it would not specifically address the nocturnal hypoglycemia and morning hyperglycemia in this patient.

Option D, increasing daily insulin dose, would likely worsen the nocturnal hypoglycemia and morning hyperglycemia, and is therefore not the optimal intervention.",Success
"A researcher conducts multiple experiments to establish an infection and disease model for Clostridium perfringens in chickens. To ensure that all instruments are free of the pathogenic organism, he uses a disinfectant that oxidizes and denatures proteins. Which of the following disinfectants did the researcher most likely use?",A,"The correct answer is A. Chlorine dioxide.

Justification:

The description of the disinfectant as one that ""oxidizes and denatures proteins"" suggests that it is a strong oxidizing agent. Chlorine dioxide is a potent oxidizing agent that is commonly used as a disinfectant. It works by denaturing proteins, disrupting cell membranes, and oxidizing cellular components, making it effective against a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria like Clostridium perfringens.

Here's why the other options are unlikely:

B. Isopropyl alcohol is a solvent that can denature proteins, but it is not a strong oxidizing agent. While it can be effective against some microorganisms, it may not be as effective against spore-forming bacteria like Clostridium perfringens.

C. Phenol is a disinfectant that works by denaturing proteins and disrupting cell membranes, but it is not a strong oxidizing agent.

D. Povidone-iodine is an iodophor that releases iodine, which has antimicrobial properties. While it can be effective against some microorganisms, it may not be as effective against spore-forming bacteria like Clostridium perfringens.

E. Benzalkonium chloride is a quaternary ammonium compound that works by disrupting cell membranes. While it can be effective against some microorganisms, it is not a strong oxidizing agent and may not be as effective against spore-forming bacteria like Clostridium perfringens.

Chlorine dioxide is a commonly used disinfectant in laboratory settings, and its oxidizing properties make it a good choice for ensuring that instruments are free of pathogenic organisms like Clostridium perfringens.",Success

Her random blood glucose is 220 mg/dL and HbA1C is 8.5%. She wants to discuss possible complications concerning her pregnancy. Which of the following cardiac complications is her infant at high risk for?",B,"The correct answer is B. Transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

The patient's type 1 diabetes mellitus and mitral stenosis increase the risk of cardiac complications in her infant. Maternal diabetes, particularly with poor glycemic control (as indicated by the patient's HbA1C of 8.5%), is associated with an increased risk of congenital heart defects in the fetus. Specifically, infants of mothers with diabetes are at higher risk for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a condition characterized by thickening of the heart muscle.

Transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a specific type of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that occurs in infants of mothers with diabetes. It is caused by the fetal heart's response to high glucose levels in utero, leading to cardiac hypertrophy. This condition is usually transient and resolves on its own after birth, but it can still cause significant morbidity and mortality.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's diabetes and mitral stenosis:

A. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is a condition that can occur in infants, but it is not specifically associated with maternal diabetes.

C. Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect that is not directly related to maternal diabetes.

D. Ebstein anomaly is a congenital heart defect that affects the tricuspid valve, but it is not associated with maternal diabetes.

"A 63-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint of back pain for the past 2 months. The pain is present throughout the day, and even at night when he lies down. He also complains of difficulty walking upstairs and says he recently started to wear adult diapers because he seems to have difficulty controlling his bowel movements. His vital signs are within normal limits. The neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense. The rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Spinal metastasis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, particularly the back pain that persists even at night, suggest a malignant process. The bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense indicate involvement of the spinal cord, which is consistent with a compressive lesion. The presence of a hard nodular mass on rectal examination and a weak rectal sphincter tone further support this diagnosis.

Spinal metastasis is a common complication of cancer, particularly in older adults. The most common primary sites of cancer that metastasize to the spine are breast, lung, prostate, kidney, and thyroid. The symptoms of spinal metastasis can vary depending on the location and extent of the metastasis, but back pain, weakness, and sensory deficits are common.

Syringomyelia (A) is a rare condition characterized by a fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord, which can cause weakness, sensory deficits, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. However, it is less likely to cause a hard nodular mass on rectal examination.

A herniated disc (C) can cause back pain and weakness, but it is typically unilateral and would not explain the bilateral symptoms and the presence of a mass on rectal examination.

An epidural abscess (D) is a rare but serious condition that can cause back pain, weakness, and sensory deficits. However, it would typically be associated with fever, leukocytosis, and signs of infection, which are not mentioned in this scenario.

A spinal hematoma (E) is a rare condition that can cause back pain and weakness, but it would typically be associated with a history of trauma or anticoagulation, which is not mentioned in this scenario.

In summary, the combination of back pain, bilateral lower limb weakness, and a hard nodular mass on rectal examination makes spinal metastasis the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.",Success

Which of the following is the best next step in therapy?",D,"The correct answer is D. Modafinil.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with narcolepsy, a chronic neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness), and disrupted nighttime sleep. The patient's Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 17, which indicates excessive daytime sleepiness, and his reports of napping for 4 hours during the day, waking up feeling exhausted, and experiencing sudden episodes of generalized body weakness, ptosis, and difficulty speaking (cataplexy) support this diagnosis.

Modafinil is a wake-promoting agent that is FDA-approved for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. It is considered a first-line therapy for narcolepsy due to its efficacy and relatively low risk of side effects.

Clomipramine (A) is a tricyclic antidepressant that may be used off-label to treat cataplexy, but it is not a first-line therapy for excessive daytime sleepiness.

Dextroamphetamine (B) and methylphenidate (C) are stimulants that may be used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy, but they are not typically considered first-line therapies for narcolepsy due to their potential for abuse and side effects.

Sleep deprivation (E) is not a treatment for narcolepsy and may actually exacerbate symptoms.

At the clinic, her blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg when lying down before dialysis and 110/55 mm Hg when seated after hemodialysis. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies after hemodialysis show a Hb of 10.5 mg/dL, a blood sugar of 189 mg/dL, and a hemoglobin A1C of 7.1%. To reduce the likelihood of falls, the most appropriate management is which of the following?",A,"The correct answer is A. Cooling the dialysate.

The patient is experiencing lightheadedness after hemodialysis sessions, which is likely due to intradialytic hypotension. This is a common complication of hemodialysis, especially in patients with diabetes mellitus. Intradialytic hypotension can increase the risk of falls, as the patient experiences dizziness and lightheadedness.

Cooling the dialysate is a recommended strategy to reduce the likelihood of intradialytic hypotension. This is because a cooler dialysate temperature can help to reduce vasodilation and improve blood pressure stability during hemodialysis. Studies have shown that cooling the dialysate can reduce the incidence of intradialytic hypotension and improve patient outcomes.

The other options are not supported by evidence as effective strategies to reduce the likelihood of falls in this patient:

B. Eating heavier meals during dialysis may not address the underlying issue of intradialytic hypotension and may even exacerbate it.

C. Increasing salt intake may not be beneficial in this patient, as it may worsen hypertension and fluid overload.

D. Increasing ultrafiltration may actually worsen intradialytic hypotension by removing more fluid from the patient.

Patellar and brachioradialis reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Tone is increased in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Rapid dorsiflexion of her right ankle elicits 3 beats of clonus. Pupils are equally round and reactive to light. A basic metabolic panel is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely inciting factor for this patient’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Increased tryptophan intake.

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, diaphoresis, shivering, and increased reflexes, are consistent with serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive levels of serotonin in the body.

The key to this question is the patient's recent addition of an amino acid supplement, which likely contains tryptophan. Tryptophan is an amino acid that is converted to serotonin in the body. The patient's use of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), increases the levels of serotonin in the body. The combination of the SSRI and the tryptophan supplement likely led to excessive serotonin levels, causing the serotonin syndrome.

Option A, decreased carbohydrate intake, is unlikely to cause serotonin syndrome. While a low-carbohydrate diet can cause some symptoms like shakiness and fatigue, it is not typically associated with serotonin syndrome.

Option C, medication change, is possible but less likely. The patient has been taking citalopram for 6 months, and it is unlikely that a medication change would cause serotonin syndrome after such a long period of stable use.

Option D, surreptitious diuretic abuse, is not supported by the patient's symptoms or laboratory results. Diuretic abuse can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, but it is not typically associated with serotonin syndrome.

Option E, surreptitious opiate abuse, is also unlikely. Opiate withdrawal can cause some symptoms like diaphoresis and shakiness, but it is not typically associated with serotonin syndrome, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with serotonin syndrome than opiate withdrawal.

In summary, the most likely inciting factor for this patient's condition is the increased tryptophan intake from the amino acid supplement, which combined with the patient's use of citalopram, led to serotonin syndrome.",Success
"A 47-year-old man presents with hemoptysis, diffuse muscle pain, and shortness of breath. He has had these symptoms before but did not seek treatment. His past medical history is not known as he is not typically followed by a doctor and is homeless. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 154/94 mmHg, pulse is 89/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. Physical examination is notable for crackles noted in the bases of the lungs bilaterally. Labs values are ordered as seen below.

Creatinine: 2.6 mg/dL

Urine:
Color: Amber
Protein: Positive
Blood: Positive

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",D,"Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Goodpasture's syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies. The patient's presentation with hemoptysis, diffuse muscle pain, and shortness of breath, along with the laboratory findings of hematuria, proteinuria, and elevated creatinine, support this diagnosis.

Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the risk of rapid progression to end-stage renal disease, the most appropriate treatment is option D: Methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide.

Methylprednisolone is used to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. Plasmapheresis is a crucial component of treatment, as it helps remove the circulating anti-GBM antibodies from the bloodstream, which are driving the disease process. Cyclophosphamide is an immunosuppressive agent that helps to reduce the production of these antibodies.

Option B, methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide, is not sufficient, as it does not address the removal of the circulating antibodies. Option C, methylprednisolone, IVIG, and cyclophosphamide, is not supported by evidence, as IVIG is not typically used in the treatment of Goodpasture's syndrome. Option E, plasmapheresis and cyclophosphamide, is incomplete, as it does not include steroid therapy to reduce inflammation. Option A, methylprednisolone alone, is not sufficient to address the severity of the patient's symptoms and the risk of disease progression.

It's essential to note that the treatment of Goodpasture's syndrome should be guided by a nephrologist or a pulmonologist, and the patient should be closely monitored for response to therapy and potential complications.",Success
"A 39-year-old woman presents with headaches, constipation, increased thirst, and increased urinary frequency. Her blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg and pulse is 67/min. Blood tests reveal high blood glucose and low potassium level. Abdominal CT scan shows a well-circumscribed homogeneous mass in the left adrenal gland. The hormone excess responsible for her symptoms uses which of the following pathways to exert its action?",A,"The correct answer is C. cAMP pathway.

The patient's symptoms, such as headaches, constipation, increased thirst, and increased urinary frequency, are consistent with Conn's syndrome, a condition caused by an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) in the adrenal gland. The abdominal CT scan confirms the presence of a well-circumscribed homogeneous mass in the left adrenal gland, which is likely an APA.

Aldosterone, the hormone responsible for the patient's symptoms, acts through the cAMP pathway. Aldosterone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor in the distal nephron, leading to the activation of adenylate cyclase, which increases the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP then activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates and activates various transport proteins, ultimately leading to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion in the kidney.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Intracellular receptors: While aldosterone does bind to an intracellular receptor, the mineralocorticoid receptor, it is not the correct pathway for aldosterone's action.

B. Tyrosine kinase receptors: This pathway is typically associated with growth factor receptors and is not involved in aldosterone's action.

D. cGMP pathway: This pathway is involved in the action of nitric oxide and other signaling molecules, but it is not related to aldosterone's action.

E. JAK/STAT pathway: This pathway is involved in cytokine signaling and is not related to aldosterone's action.

It's worth noting that the patient's low potassium level and high blood pressure are consistent with aldosterone excess, which further supports the diagnosis of Conn's syndrome.",Success
"A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a headache. He states that this is the worst headache he has ever had and that his symptoms have not been improving. The patient complains of pain in his jaw that is worse when he chews. He has a past medical history of insomnia and is currently taking alprazolam. His temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 157/98 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for tenderness over the patient's scalp, jaw, and temporal area. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. IV steroids.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the severe headache, jaw pain exacerbated by chewing, and tenderness over the scalp, jaw, and temporal area, are highly suggestive of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), also known as Temporal Arteritis. GCA is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent vision loss and other complications.

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommends immediate initiation of high-dose corticosteroids, such as IV steroids, as the first-line treatment for GCA. This is because steroids can help reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the affected arteries.

While a CT head (Option A) may be ordered to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, it is not the best next step in management. Ibuprofen (Option B) may provide some pain relief, but it is not a sufficient treatment for GCA. Lumbar puncture (Option D) is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient's symptoms do not suggest meningitis or other central nervous system infections. Temporal artery biopsy (Option E) may be diagnostic for GCA, but it is not necessary for immediate management, and treatment should not be delayed while waiting for biopsy results.

In summary, the best next step in management is to initiate IV steroids to treat the suspected GCA and prevent potential complications.",Success
"A 34-year-old man with acute lymphocytic leukemia presents for follow-up in the oncology clinic after his second cycle of chemotherapy. In addition to intermittent nausea, he has mild weakness, tingling, and numbness in his left hand. With his affected hand, he is able to grip, but occasionally drops small objects. His oncologist tells him that one of his chemotherapy agents likely caused his neuropathy given its strong association with neurotoxicity. He was recently treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and dasatinib. The culprit medication works by which of the following mechanisms of action?",B,"The correct answer is B. Blocks microtubule formation.

The patient's symptoms of mild weakness, tingling, and numbness in his left hand, along with occasional dropping of small objects, are consistent with peripheral neuropathy. The oncologist suspects that one of the chemotherapy agents is responsible for this neurotoxicity.

Among the options, vincristine is the culprit medication that works by blocking microtubule formation. Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid that inhibits the polymerization of microtubules, which are essential for axonal transport and neuronal function. This mechanism of action can lead to neurotoxicity, including peripheral neuropathy.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Covalently X-links DNA: This is the mechanism of action of cyclophosphamide, an alkylating agent that damages DNA.

C. Intercalates between DNA: This is not a mechanism of action associated with any of the listed medications.

D. Modifies DNA transcription and protein synthesis: This is a broad mechanism of action that could apply to various medications, but it's not specific to the neurotoxicity caused by vincristine.

E. Blocks tyrosine kinase: This is the mechanism of action of dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat certain types of leukemia. While dasatinib can cause side effects, it is not typically associated with peripheral neuropathy.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Blocks microtubule formation, which is the mechanism of action of vincristine.",Success
"A 1-day-old infant is in the neonatal intensive care unit due to respiratory failure from pulmonary hypoplasia. The mother is a healthy 32-year-old woman who did not have regular prenatal exams. On physical examination, you notice low-set ears and retrognathia with abnormal extremity development. Which of the following abnormalities is associated with the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",C,"The correct answer is D. Rocker bottom feet.

The patient's symptoms, including pulmonary hypoplasia, low-set ears, retrognathia, and abnormal extremity development, are consistent with a diagnosis of Potter sequence. This is a rare congenital disorder characterized by oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid) due to bilateral renal agenesis (absence of kidneys) or severe kidney dysfunction.

Rocker bottom feet, also known as clubfoot, are a common feature of Potter sequence. The other options are not directly associated with Potter sequence:

A. Hepatosplenomegaly is more commonly associated with infectious or hematological disorders, such as sepsis or hemolytic disease.

B. Macroorchidism is a feature of Fragile X syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability and distinct physical features.

C. Posterior urethral valves are a congenital anomaly that can cause urinary obstruction and are not typically associated with Potter sequence.

E. Duodenal atresia is a congenital intestinal obstruction that can occur in isolation or as part of a syndrome, but it is not a characteristic feature of Potter sequence.

It's worth noting that the lack of regular prenatal exams in the mother may have contributed to the delayed diagnosis of the underlying condition, highlighting the importance of regular prenatal care in detecting potential fetal anomalies.",Success
"A 47-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer who is undergoing chemotherapy comes to the physician for a follow-up exam. She reports extreme fatigue since beginning her chemotherapy regimen.

The patient is started on a new medication. One week later, serum studies show a hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 2,000/mm3 with 2% monocytes, and a platelet count of 56,000/mm3. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?",C,"The correct answer is E. Sargramostim.

Here's why:

The patient's initial lab results show a low hemoglobin (10.4 g/dL), low leukocyte count (800/mm3), and low platelet count (50,000/mm3), indicating pancytopenia, which is a common side effect of chemotherapy. After starting the new medication, the patient's lab results show a slight increase in hemoglobin (10.6 g/dL) and leukocyte count (2,000/mm3), but the platelet count remains low (56,000/mm3).

Sargramostim is a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that stimulates the production of granulocytes and macrophages. It is often used to support bone marrow recovery after chemotherapy. The increase in leukocyte count, specifically the increase in granulocytes (monocytes are a type of granulocyte), is consistent with the effects of sargramostim.

The other options are not likely to cause these findings:

A. Aldesleukin is an interleukin-2 (IL-2) that stimulates the immune system, but it is not typically used to support bone marrow recovery after chemotherapy.

B. Interferon beta is an immunomodulator used to treat multiple sclerosis, but it is not typically used to support bone marrow recovery after chemotherapy.

C. Filgrastim is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that stimulates the production of granulocytes, but it would be expected to increase the neutrophil count, not the monocyte count.

D. Romiplostim is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist that stimulates platelet production, but it would be expected to increase the platelet count, which remains low in this patient.

Therefore, based on the patient's lab results and the mechanism of action of the medications, sargramostim is the most likely cause of these findings.",Success
"A male newborn born at 27 weeks' gestation is evaluated for rapid breathing and hypoxia shortly after birth. His mother had no prenatal care. Cardiopulmonary examination shows normal heart sounds, intercostal retractions, and nasal flaring. An x-ray of the chest shows low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities. He is started on nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",C,"The correct answer is C. Hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy.

The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS), a common condition in preterm infants. RDS is caused by a lack of surfactant, a substance that helps expand the lungs and maintain alveolar stability. The characteristic radiographic findings of low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities support this diagnosis.

Hyaline membranes are a pathologic hallmark of RDS, formed by the deposition of fibrin and other proteins on the alveolar surface. They are a result of the inflammatory response to the lack of surfactant and can be seen on lung biopsy.

The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis of RDS:

A. Bilateral pleural effusions on lung ultrasound may be seen in other conditions, such as congenital heart disease or infection, but are not specific to RDS.

B. Corkscrew-shaped organisms on umbilical cord culture suggest a diagnosis of Listeria monocytogenes infection, which is not directly related to RDS.

D. Meconium-stained fluid on deep suctioning is more consistent with meconium aspiration syndrome, which is a different condition.

E. Patent ductus arteriosus on echocardiography may be seen in preterm infants, but it is not a direct consequence of RDS.

Abdominal ultrasonography shows a normal liver, a common bile duct caliber of 10 mm (normal < 6 mm) and a gallbladder with multiple gallstones and no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Choledocholithiasis.

Here's why:

The patient presents with severe, sharp, penetrating abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, which are classic symptoms of biliary colic. The absence of fever, guarding, and rebound tenderness makes acute cholecystitis (option D) less likely.

The laboratory results show elevated total bilirubin (4.1 mg/dL) and alkaline phosphatase (348 U/L), which suggest an obstructive pattern, consistent with choledocholithiasis (gallstones in the common bile duct). The AST and ALT elevations are likely secondary to the obstruction.

The abdominal ultrasonography findings of a normal liver, a dilated common bile duct (10 mm, normal < 6 mm), and a gallbladder with multiple gallstones without wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid further support the diagnosis of choledocholithiasis.

Acute hepatitis A (option A) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, which do not suggest a viral hepatitis pattern. Autoimmune hepatitis (option C) is also unlikely, as the patient's laboratory results do not show a marked elevation in transaminases or a significant increase in immunoglobulins. Pancreatitis (option E) is not supported by the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

In summary, the combination of the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and ultrasonography findings point to choledocholithiasis as the most likely cause of her condition.",Success

Her medical history is positive only for frequent bouts of sinusitis. She currently denies any smoking, drinks a glass of red wine/day, and she denies any past illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 87/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. Her physical examination shows decreased air movement throughout the right lung but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur, and a gravid uterus without acute findings. On physical examination, she is afebrile, tachycardic to 121/min, normotensive, and demonstrates an O2 saturation of 92%. Which of the following is the best next step in the evaluation of the most likely diagnosis for this patient?",D,"The correct answer is A. D-dimer.

The patient's symptoms, particularly shortness of breath and right-sided chest pain worsened by inspiration, suggest a high probability of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's recent travel history, which involves a long flight, increases her risk for developing a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequent PE.

Given the patient's pregnancy, it's essential to approach the diagnosis of PE with caution, as some imaging modalities may pose risks to the fetus. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends a stepwise approach to diagnose PE in pregnant women.

The first step is to assess the patient's clinical probability of PE using a tool like the Wells score or the revised Geneva score. Based on the patient's symptoms and risk factors, her clinical probability is likely high.

The next step is to perform a D-dimer assay, which is a sensitive but not specific test for PE. A negative D-dimer result can help rule out PE, but a positive result requires further evaluation. In pregnant women, the D-dimer level may be elevated due to the pregnancy itself, so the test should be interpreted with caution.

Option B, ECG, is not a useful test for diagnosing PE, as it may show nonspecific changes or be normal.

Option C, chest radiography, may show signs of PE, such as oligemia or a wedge-shaped infiltrate, but it is not a sensitive test and may not detect all cases of PE.

Option D, V/Q scan, is a sensitive test for PE, but it may not be readily available, and the radiation exposure, although relatively low, may be a concern in pregnancy.

Option E, CT pulmonary angiogram, is a highly sensitive and specific test for PE, but it involves a higher radiation dose than V/Q scan and may not be the best initial test in pregnancy.

In summary, given the patient's symptoms and risk factors, a D-dimer assay is the best next step in the evaluation of PE, as it is a non-invasive test that can help rule out PE or guide further evaluation.",Success

The patient's symptoms, specifically the presence of blood in the urine (hematuria), are consistent with hemorrhagic cystitis, a known side effect of cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide is a nitrogen mustard alkylating agent commonly used in the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma. One of its metabolites, acrolein, is toxic to the bladder mucosa, leading to inflammation and hemorrhage.

The other options are not directly related to the development of hematuria:

Justification:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a severe hypersensitivity reaction that can be caused by certain medications, including sulfonamides. The widespread erythematous rash, skin peeling on the palms and soles, and mucous membrane involvement (not explicitly mentioned but implied by the patient's symptoms) are all characteristic features of SJS.

The laboratory results also support this diagnosis, with evidence of hepatic dysfunction (elevated AST and ALT), renal impairment (elevated creatinine and urea nitrogen), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count).

Colonoscopy with biopsy is later performed showing a neoplastic growth in the descending colon. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for his cardiac findings?",E,"The correct answer is A. Viridans streptococci.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest endocarditis, which is an infection of the heart valves. The high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur over the right upper sternal border, conjunctival hemorrhages, petechiae on the lower extremities, and pale mucous membranes are all consistent with endocarditis.

The patient's history of weight loss, fatigue, and low-grade fever also supports this diagnosis. The presence of a neoplastic growth in the descending colon on colonoscopy with biopsy suggests that the patient may have a source of bacteremia, which can lead to endocarditis.

Viridans streptococci are a common cause of endocarditis, particularly in patients with underlying valvular heart disease or prosthetic heart valves. They are also known to cause endocarditis in patients with bacteremia from a gastrointestinal source, such as a colon cancer.

The other options are less likely explanations for the patient's cardiac findings:

B. Treponema pallidum is the bacterium that causes syphilis, which can cause cardiovascular symptoms, but it is less likely to cause endocarditis in this patient.

C. Malignant colonic neoplasm is the underlying cause of the patient's bacteremia, but it is not the direct cause of the cardiac findings.

D. Collagen vascular disease is not a likely explanation for the patient's cardiac findings, as it is not typically associated with endocarditis.

E. Group D streptococci are a type of bacterium that can cause endocarditis, but they are less common than Viridans streptococci as a cause of endocarditis in patients with a gastrointestinal source of bacteremia.

Which of the following medications was most likely administered to the patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Sargramostim.

Here's why:

The patient is experiencing a severe reaction 30 minutes after receiving a ""blood-improving"" medication, which is likely a granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to address her low white blood cell count (leucocyte count 700/mm³). The symptoms described, such as difficulty breathing, severe muscle pain, and vomiting, are consistent with an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis.

Sargramostim is a recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that can cause anaphylaxis, particularly during the initial dose. GM-CSF stimulates the production of granulocytes and macrophages, which can help increase the white blood cell count.

Filgrastim (A) is a G-CSF that stimulates the production of neutrophils, but it is less likely to cause anaphylaxis compared to Sargramostim.

Interleukin 3 (B) is a cytokine that stimulates the production of multiple blood cell lines, but it is not commonly used as a ""blood-improving"" medication and is not typically associated with anaphylaxis.

Platelet-derived growth factor (C) is involved in platelet production and is not typically used to address low white blood cell counts.

Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 78/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a supple neck. Neurologic examination shows psychomotor agitation. Attention and concentration are impaired; she makes multiple errors while performing the serial sevens test. Her speech is disorganized. Her fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 122 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Check serum electrolytes.

The patient's symptoms, such as increasing confusion, unusual behavior, and disorientation, are consistent with delirium. Delirium is a common condition in older adults, especially those with underlying medical conditions, and can be caused by various factors, including dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and medication side effects.

Given the patient's history of not eating or drinking much for the past 6 days, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance are high on the list of potential causes. Hydrochlorothiazide, her medication for hypertension, can also contribute to electrolyte imbalance, particularly hypokalemia (low potassium levels).

Checking serum electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, and chloride, is a crucial step in evaluating and managing delirium. Electrolyte abnormalities can exacerbate delirium, and correcting them can help improve the patient's mental status.

While the other options may be relevant in certain contexts, they are not the most appropriate next step in this scenario:

A. Lumbar puncture is not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of meningitis or encephalitis.

B. Checking serum TSH level may be relevant if the patient had symptoms suggestive of thyroid dysfunction, but it is not a priority in this case.

D. A CT scan of the head may be necessary if there are concerns about a structural brain lesion or stroke, but it is not the most immediate concern in this scenario.

E. A chest x-ray may be indicated if there are concerns about pneumonia or other respiratory infections, but it is not a priority in this case.

By checking serum electrolytes, the healthcare provider can identify any potential electrolyte imbalances and take corrective action to address them, which may help improve the patient's delirium.",Success
"A 39-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fever, generalized fatigue, and chills for 1 week. She has been having dull right-side abdominal pain during this period. She has nausea. She has no history of travel outside the United States. She has type 1 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include insulin and an oral contraceptive. She appears ill. Her temperature is 40°C (104°F), pulse is 118/min, and blood pressure is 106/70 mm Hg. On examination, the liver is palpated 2–3 cm below the right costal margin and is tender. There are decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:

A right upper quadrant ultrasound is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",E,"The correct answer is E. Perform percutaneous drainage.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of pyogenic liver abscess. The right upper quadrant ultrasound likely shows a liver abscess, which is a collection of pus in the liver. The patient's fever, chills, and right-side abdominal pain are consistent with this diagnosis. The elevated leukocyte count and alkaline phosphatase level also support this diagnosis.

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform percutaneous drainage of the liver abscess. This involves inserting a needle or catheter through the skin and into the abscess to drain the pus and infected material. This procedure can help to alleviate symptoms, reduce the risk of complications, and promote healing.

Discontinuing the oral contraceptive (Option A) may be necessary to reduce the risk of thrombosis, but it is not the most immediate priority in this case. Obtaining a hepatoiminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan (Option B) may be useful in evaluating gallbladder function, but it is not necessary in this case. Performing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (Option C) may be necessary if there is evidence of bile duct obstruction, but it is not indicated based on the information provided. Administering metronidazole (Option D) may be necessary to treat the infection, but it should be done in conjunction with drainage of the abscess, not as a standalone treatment.

It's worth noting that the patient's type 1 diabetes mellitus and use of insulin should be taken into consideration when managing her care, but it does not change the initial management of the liver abscess.",Success
A 57-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for follow-up of his diabetes. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 months ago and has been started on metformin and lifestyle modifications. The patient does not have any current complaints except for occasional numbness in both hands and feet. His HbA1C is 8.5% and serum glucose is 240 mg/dL. Which of the following is the best next step in this patient’s condition?,C,"The correct answer is C. Add a sulfonylurea.

Here's why:

The patient has been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 months ago and has been started on metformin and lifestyle modifications. Despite this, his HbA1C is still 8.5%, indicating poor glycemic control. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends a target HbA1C of less than 7% for most patients with diabetes.

Given the patient's current medication regimen and lack of significant improvement in glycemic control, adding another oral agent is a reasonable next step. Sulfonylureas, such as glyburide or glipizide, are a good choice because they work by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreas and can be effective in reducing HbA1C.

Option A, starting basal-bolus insulin, may be premature at this point, as the patient has not yet failed oral therapy. Insulin therapy is typically reserved for patients who have failed oral agents or have more severe disease.

Option B, continuing metformin monotherapy, is not the best choice because the patient's HbA1C is still elevated, indicating that metformin alone is not sufficient to achieve good glycemic control.

Option D, adding an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, such as acarbose, may not be the most effective choice because these medications work by slowing the absorption of carbohydrates from the gut and may not have a significant impact on HbA1C.

Option E, adding a thiazolidinedione, such as pioglitazone, may be associated with increased risk of heart failure and is not typically used as a first-line agent.

The patient's symptoms of numbness in both hands and feet are likely related to diabetic neuropathy, which is a common complication of diabetes. However, this symptom does not change the management of his diabetes, and the focus should be on improving glycemic control.",Success
"A 42-year-old chronic alcoholic man was admitted to the hospital for inappropriate behavior and disturbed memory. He presents with severe retrograde memory loss, confusion, and confabulation. Neurologic examination showed horizontal nystagmus. He also has bilateral pretibial pitting edema and perioral erythema. CT studies of the brain were normal. The duty physician suspects the patient may be vitamin deficient. Which of the following reactions does the deficient vitamin mediate?",A,"The correct answer is D. Isocitrate + NAD+ <=> Alpha-Ketoglutarate + CO2 + NADH.

The patient's symptoms, including severe retrograde memory loss, confusion, and confabulation, are consistent with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a neurological disorder caused by thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency. Thiamine is a cofactor for several enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including transketolase and pyruvate dehydrogenase.

The reaction mediated by thiamine is the conversion of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, which is catalyzed by the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase. This reaction is part of the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle) and is essential for energy production in the brain.

The other options are not directly related to thiamine deficiency:

A. Alpha-Ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA <=> Succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH is the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, which is a different enzyme that requires thiamine as a cofactor.

B. Acetyl-CoA + Oxaloacetate + H2O <=> Citrate + CoA + H+ is the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme citrate synthase, which is the first step of the citric acid cycle.

C. Succinate + FAD (enzyme bound) <=> Fumarate + FADH2 is the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, which is a flavin-dependent enzyme.

E. Succinyl-CoA + Pi + GDP <=> Succinate + GTP + CoA is the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme succinyl-CoA synthetase, which is involved in the citric acid cycle but does not directly involve thiamine.

Therefore, option D is the correct answer.",Success
"A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks gestation is brought to the emergency department by her husband. She is in active labor and has lost a lot of blood in the past 2 hours, but appears alert and cooperative. At the hospital, her blood pressure is 88/65 mm Hg, the pulse is 110/min, and the respirations are 23/min. Neither the hospital nor the emergency department is equipped for high-risk pregnancies. The patient and her husband request a transfer to a more capable center. They are informed of the hospital’s obligations under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act and the risks of transfer. They insist to be transferred. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Treat and transfer the patient after she makes a written request.

According to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), a patient who comes to an emergency department in active labor must be stabilized and treated until the emergency condition is resolved or the patient is transferred to a more capable facility. In this case, the patient is in active labor and has lost a significant amount of blood, indicating a high-risk pregnancy.

The hospital has an obligation to stabilize the patient and provide necessary treatment before transferring her to a more capable center. The patient and her husband have been informed of the risks and benefits of transfer, and they have insisted on being transferred.

Option D is the most appropriate next step, as it ensures that the patient receives necessary treatment and stabilization before being transferred. The written request is necessary to document the patient's informed consent and understanding of the risks and benefits of transfer.

Option A is incorrect because it is not safe to allow the patient to leave in a private vehicle, especially given her unstable condition. Option B is incorrect because the hospital has an obligation to stabilize the patient before referring her to another facility. Option C is incorrect because the patient has the right to request a transfer, and the hospital must respect her autonomy. Option E is incorrect because while the medical benefits of transfer should be considered, the patient's request for transfer takes precedence in this scenario.",Success
A 7-year-old boy is brought to your office with complaints of wheezing and dyspnea. Laboratory work reveals eosinophilia and positive skin tests for allergens. Which of the following types of drugs would be an effective treatment in this patient?,D,"The correct answer is A. Beta-2 antagonist.

The patient's symptoms of wheezing and dyspnea, along with laboratory results showing eosinophilia and positive skin tests for allergens, are consistent with a diagnosis of asthma. Beta-2 agonists, such as albuterol or salmeterol, are a mainstay of treatment for asthma. They work by stimulating beta-2 receptors in the lungs, which causes bronchodilation and relaxation of airway smooth muscle, thereby relieving wheezing and dyspnea.

Here's why the other options are not correct:

B. Histone deacetylase inhibitors are a class of medications used to treat certain types of cancer and are not typically used to treat asthma or wheezing.

C. VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inhibitors are used to treat conditions such as macular degeneration and certain types of cancer, but they are not used to treat asthma or respiratory symptoms.

D. Muscarinic antagonists, such as ipratropium, are used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and may be used in combination with beta-2 agonists for asthma, but they are not the first-line treatment for asthma.

E. Anticoagulants, such as warfarin or heparin, are used to prevent blood clots and are not used to treat asthma or respiratory symptoms.

It's worth noting that the treatment of asthma often involves a combination of medications, including inhaled corticosteroids, beta-2 agonists, and other medications, as well as lifestyle modifications and avoidance of triggers. However, among the options provided, beta-2 antagonists are the most effective treatment for this patient's symptoms.",Success
A 16-year-old healthy female presents to her pediatrician concerned that she has not had a menstrual period. She has no past medical history and takes no medications. She plays volleyball and gets good grades in school. Her BMI is 22 kg/m2. Physical examination reveals normal female external genitalia and pubic hair along the mons pubis and superomedial thighs. Her breasts appear normal. Transabdominal ultrasound reveals an absent uterus. Serum testosterone levels is within the normal range for females. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?,E,"The correct answer is E. Failure of paramesonephric duct development.

Here's why:

The patient presents with primary amenorrhea (no menstrual periods) and is found to have an absent uterus on transabdominal ultrasound. The physical examination reveals normal female external genitalia and pubic hair, indicating normal virilization. The serum testosterone level is within the normal range for females, ruling out androgen excess or disorders of sex development.

The most likely cause of this patient's condition is a failure of paramesonephric duct development, also known as Müllerian agenesis or Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. This is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the uterus, cervix, and upper part of the vagina. It is usually diagnosed in adolescence when girls present with primary amenorrhea.

The other options can be ruled out:

A. Pituitary tumor: This would likely cause hormonal imbalances, which are not evident in this patient.

B. Absence of second X chromosome (Turner syndrome): This would typically present with short stature, gonadal dysgenesis, and other characteristic physical features, which are not mentioned in this patient.

C. Mutation in enzyme that metabolizes testosterone: This would likely cause androgen excess or disorders of sex development, which are not seen in this patient.

D. Androgen receptor mutation: This would also cause androgen insensitivity syndrome, which is not consistent with the patient's normal female external genitalia and pubic hair.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a failure of paramesonephric duct development, specifically MRKH syndrome.",Success
"A 61-year-old nulliparous woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Her last Pap smear 3 years ago showed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. HPV testing was negative at that time. On questioning, she has had fatigue and an increase in abdominal girth despite a 5-kg (11.0-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. She has gastroesophageal reflux disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Menarche was at the age of 10 years and her last menstrual period was 2 years ago. Current medications include omeprazole and levothyroxine. Abdominal examination shows shifting dullness. There is tenderness to palpation of the right lower quadrant but no guarding or rebound. Bimanual palpation shows a small uterus and a right adnexal mass. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",B,"The correct answer is B. Elevated serum CA-125 level.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, particularly the increase in abdominal girth despite weight loss, fatigue, and the presence of a right adnexal mass, suggest a possible diagnosis of ovarian cancer. The presence of shifting dullness on abdominal examination also supports this diagnosis, as it indicates the presence of ascites, which is a common finding in ovarian cancer.

CA-125 is a tumor marker that is often elevated in ovarian cancer, particularly in epithelial ovarian cancer, which is the most common type of ovarian cancer. While it's not specific to ovarian cancer and can be elevated in other conditions, such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and even normal physiological processes like menstruation, it's a useful marker in the evaluation of ovarian masses.

The other options are not as likely:

A. Proliferation of endometrial glands: While the patient is postmenopausal, there is no indication of abnormal uterine bleeding or other symptoms suggestive of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer.

C. Elevated serum beta-hCG level: Beta-hCG is a marker for gestational trophoblastic disease, which is unlikely in a 61-year-old postmenopausal woman.

D. Prolonged prothrombin time: There is no indication of a bleeding disorder or liver disease that would cause a prolonged prothrombin time.

E. Cervical dysplasia on Pap smear: The patient's previous Pap smear showed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, but HPV testing was negative. There is no indication of cervical dysplasia or cancer.

It's essential to note that further evaluation, including imaging studies and possibly surgical intervention, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment.",Success

Approx. 1 month ago, he had a radical prostatectomy, pelvic radiation, and several rounds of chemotherapy for aggressive prostate cancer in Nicaragua and was discharged from the hospital with a suprapelvic catheter and a plan for more chemotherapy. He was coming to the United States to spend time with some extended family. According to the grand-daughter his mental status was altered upon arrival and his health began to decline. She is not aware of his past medical status or medications. At the hospital, his blood pressure is 98/60 mm Hg, the pulse id 110/min, the respiratory rate is 21/min, and the temperature is 35.6°C (96.1°F). On physical exam, the patient appears cachectic, drowsy, and only responds to questions by nodding his head. His heart rate is tachycardic with a regular rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The cystotomy incision for his suprapelvic catheter is red and swollen. The patient admitted to the hospital and stabilized and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The catheter tube produces no urine over 24 hours and only thick green-white puss can be expressed. The treatment team concludes this patient has urinary tract obstruction. What is the best method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Ultrasound.

In this scenario, the patient presents with a urinary tract obstruction, which is suspected due to the lack of urine production from the suprapelvic catheter and the presence of thick green-white pus. Ultrasound is the best method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction in this patient for several reasons:

1. Non-invasive: Ultrasound is a non-invasive procedure that does not require radiation or contrast agents, making it a safe option for an elderly patient with a compromised medical status.
2. Rapid diagnosis: Ultrasound can quickly provide information about the presence and severity of urinary tract obstruction, which is essential in this patient's critical condition.
3. Assessment of hydronephrosis: Ultrasound can evaluate the presence and degree of hydronephrosis (kidney swelling), which is a common complication of urinary tract obstruction.
4. Identification of stones or other obstructions: Ultrasound can help identify stones, tumors, or other obstructions that may be causing the urinary tract obstruction.

The other options are not the best choice for the following reasons:

A. Renal biopsy: This is an invasive procedure that is not necessary for diagnosing urinary tract obstruction and may pose risks for the patient.

C. Abdominal-pelvic CT scan: While CT scans can provide detailed information about the urinary tract, they require radiation and contrast agents, which may be contraindicated in this patient's condition.

D. Blood analysis: Blood tests can provide information about kidney function and electrolyte imbalance, but they are not specific for diagnosing urinary tract obstruction.

E. Urine analysis: Urine analysis may provide information about urinary tract infection, but it is not the best method for evaluating urinary tract obstruction.

In summary, ultrasound is the best method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction in this patient due to its non-invasive nature, rapid diagnosis, and ability to assess hydronephrosis and identify obstructions.",Success

The patient smokes half a pack per day of cigarettes and drinks 2-3 beers throughout the day. His family history is significant for Parkinson disease in his father. On physical exam, his blood pressure is 159/84, pulse is 74/min, and respirations are 12/min. He has a high frequency bilateral hand tremor elicited on finger-to-nose testing. His neurological exam is otherwise unremarkable. This patient should be started on which of the following medications?",C,"The correct answer is B. Primidone.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with essential tremor (ET), a common movement disorder characterized by involuntary, rhythmic tremors of the hands, head, or voice. The key features of ET include:

1. Bilateral hand tremor, often high-frequency (as seen in this patient)
2. Tremor that worsens with action (e.g., finger-to-nose testing)
3. Gradual improvement over the course of the day (as reported by the patient)
4. Absence of other neurological signs or symptoms (e.g., bradykinesia, rigidity, or postural instability)

Given the patient's symptoms and exam findings, the most appropriate medication to start would be primidone, a beta blocker that is specifically indicated for the treatment of essential tremor. Primidone is effective in reducing tremor amplitude and improving functional abilities in patients with ET.

The other options are not suitable for the following reasons:

A. Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that may be used for anxiety or insomnia, but it is not typically used to treat essential tremor.

C. Propranolol is a non-selective beta blocker that may be used to treat certain cardiovascular conditions, but it is not as effective as primidone for essential tremor.

D. Topiramate is an anticonvulsant medication that may be used for epilepsy or migraines, but it is not typically used to treat essential tremor.

E. Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic medication that may be used to treat Parkinson's disease, but it is not typically used to treat essential tremor.

It's worth noting that the patient's family history of Parkinson's disease may raise concerns about the possibility of Parkinson's disease, but the patient's symptoms and exam findings are more consistent with essential tremor. Further evaluation and monitoring may be necessary to rule out other conditions, but primidone is a reasonable starting point for treatment.",Success

Based on this experience, she decides to write up the initial presentation and clinical course of these patients and publish them in a journal. Which of the following is most likely true about this study?",B,"The correct answer is B. Hypothesis testing cannot be performed.

This study is a case series, which is a type of observational study that involves reporting on a series of patients with a particular condition or outcome. In this case, the pediatrician is reporting on 9 patients who developed paralysis after a flu-like illness. Case series studies are typically descriptive and aim to provide a detailed account of the clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of a group of patients.

Hypothesis testing is not possible in a case series study because there is no control group or comparison group to test hypotheses against. The study is simply a descriptive report of the patients' characteristics and outcomes, without any attempt to compare them to a control group or test a specific hypothesis.

Over the subsequent week, serial labs are drawn showing target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. He is started on a prophylactic regimen that is continued upon discharge. Which of the following is consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed in this case?",C,"The correct answer is B. 50S ribosome inhibitor.

The patient's presentation and lab results are consistent with a diagnosis of trauma-induced splenectomy, which increases the risk of sepsis, particularly due to encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The prophylactic regimen started in this case is likely an antibiotic, specifically a 50S ribosome inhibitor, to prevent pneumococcal infections.

The 50S ribosome inhibitor, such as erythromycin or azithromycin, works by binding to the 50S subunit of bacterial ribosomes, inhibiting protein synthesis and ultimately leading to bacterial death.

The other options are not directly related to the mechanism of action of the antibiotic likely prescribed in this case:

A. 30S ribosome inhibitor: This class of antibiotics, such as tetracyclines, works by binding to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes.

C. Cell wall cross-linking inhibitor: This class of antibiotics, such as beta-lactams (e.g., penicillins and cephalosporins), works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.

D. DNA gyrase inhibitor: This class of antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones, works by inhibiting bacterial DNA replication.

E. Folate metabolism inhibitor: This class of antibiotics, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, works by inhibiting bacterial folate metabolism.

In this case, the prophylactic antibiotic regimen is likely aimed at preventing pneumococcal infections, which is consistent with the mechanism of action of a 50S ribosome inhibitor.",Success

The scotch tape test is positive. The patient has a previous documented allergy to albendazole. Which of the following is an alternative medication that can be used?",E,"The correct answer is E. Pyrantel pamoate.

The patient's symptoms and positive scotch tape test suggest a diagnosis of pinworm (Enterobius vermicularis) infection. The scotch tape test is a diagnostic test used to collect eggs from the perianal region, which is a common area for pinworms to lay their eggs.

Given the patient's allergy to albendazole, an alternative medication is needed. Pyrantel pamoate is an anthelmintic medication that is effective against pinworms and is a suitable alternative.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication, not an anthelmintic, and is not effective against pinworms.

B. Diethylcarbamazine is an antiparasitic medication, but it is primarily used to treat filarial infections such as lymphatic filariasis, not pinworm infections.

C. Ivermectin is an anthelmintic medication, but it is not typically used to treat pinworm infections. It is more commonly used to treat strongyloidiasis, scabies, and river blindness.

D. Praziquantel is an anthelmintic medication, but it is primarily used to treat trematode infections such as schistosomiasis and liver flukes, not pinworm infections.

"A 21-year-old female presents to the office after a health screening in which she was found to have high blood pressure. At the office, the blood pressure is 168/114 mm Hg. You have seen the patient in the past for amenorrhea and infertility issues, but she denies taking any medication at this time. On examination, the patient is short and normal weight but has a webbed neck. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the elevated blood pressure?",A,"The correct answer is A. Central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys.

The patient's physical examination findings, particularly the webbed neck, suggest Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects females. Turner syndrome is characterized by short stature, ovarian dysgenesis, and various physical features, including a webbed neck. One of the common associated conditions in Turner syndrome is hypertension, which can be caused by renal abnormalities, including horseshoe kidney (central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys).

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

B. Genetic predisposition to essential hypertension is a possibility, but the patient's young age and physical examination findings suggest a specific underlying condition rather than essential hypertension.

C. Neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal gland is unlikely, as there is no mention of other symptoms or signs that would suggest an adrenal tumor, such as episodic hypertension, headaches, or palpitations.

D. Oral contraceptive use is not a likely cause, as the patient denies taking any medication, including oral contraceptives.

A 25-year-old African American man presents to his primary care provider for routine blood work. He is a well-known case of sickle cell disease treated with hydroxyurea and tramadol as needed for pain. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. The patient asks if his disease can adversely affect his kidneys because his friend was recently diagnosed with end-stage renal failure. Which of the following is a renal complication of sickle cell disease?,E,"The correct answer is E. Impaired urine concentration ability.

Sickle cell disease can cause several renal complications, including impaired urine concentration ability. This is due to the sickling of red blood cells in the renal medulla, which leads to ischemia and damage to the renal concentrating mechanism. As a result, patients with sickle cell disease may have a decreased ability to concentrate their urine, leading to polyuria and increased urine output.

Option A, transitional cell carcinoma, is a type of bladder cancer and is not a direct renal complication of sickle cell disease.

Option B, membranous glomerulonephritis, is a type of glomerulonephritis that can cause kidney damage, but it is not a common complication of sickle cell disease.

Option C, proximal renal tubular acidosis, is a rare complication of sickle cell disease, but it is not the most common or well-known renal complication.

Option D, impaired urine diluting ability, is not a recognized complication of sickle cell disease.

"A gunshot victim is brought to the Emergency Department and appears to be in shock. You note a penetrating wound at the level of L3. Assuming the bullet remained at this level, which vascular structure might have been injured?",A,"The correct answer is A. Inferior vena cava.

Here's why:

The patient has a penetrating wound at the level of L3, which suggests that the bullet may have injured structures in the retroperitoneal space. The inferior vena cava (IVC) is a major vascular structure that runs posterior to the abdominal cavity and is located at the level of L3-L5. Given the location of the wound, it is possible that the bullet may have injured the IVC, which could lead to significant bleeding and shock.

The other options are less likely:

* B. Internal iliac artery: While the internal iliac artery is a branch of the common iliac artery, it is located more distally, at the level of the pelvis, and is less likely to be injured by a bullet at the level of L3.
* C. Internal iliac vein: Similar to the internal iliac artery, the internal iliac vein is also located more distally and is less likely to be injured by a bullet at the level of L3.
* D. Renal artery: The renal arteries arise from the abdominal aorta at the level of L1-L2, which is above the level of the wound. While it's possible that the bullet could have traveled upward and injured the renal artery, it's less likely given the location of the wound.

"A clinical trial is conducted to test the efficacy of a new drug, A, to treat tinea versicolor. A total of 500 participants are recruited for the study and are randomized into 2 groups in equal numbers. Group 1, the study treatment group, is given drug A, while group 2, the control group, is given the current standard antifungal therapy. After the completion of therapy, 190 participants from the study treatment group and 165 participants from the control group are cured. Which calculation below represents the number needed to treat for the new drug?",B,"The correct answer is B. 250/25.

To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), we need to determine the absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the treatment group and the control group.

First, let's calculate the cure rates for each group:

Study treatment group (drug A): 190/250 = 0.76 (or 76%)
Control group (standard antifungal therapy): 165/250 = 0.66 (or 66%)

Next, we calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR):

ARR = Cure rate in treatment group - Cure rate in control group
= 0.76 - 0.66
= 0.10 (or 10%)

The NNT is the reciprocal of the ARR:

NNT = 1 / ARR
= 1 / 0.10
= 10

So, the NNT is 10. This means that 10 patients need to be treated with drug A to cure one additional patient compared to the standard antifungal therapy.

The correct calculation is represented by option B: 250/25, which is equivalent to 10 (250 is the total number of patients in the treatment group, and 25 is the number of additional patients cured in the treatment group compared to the control group).",Success
"A 38-year-old woman is being evaluated by her primary care physician for chronic, widespread pain that started around 5 months ago. This pain has been accompanied by sleeping issues. Her friend recommended that she try yoga to relieve the pain, but she says this has not helped her at all. Se says the symptoms have begun to impact her daily functions and keep her from doing things she used to enjoy. Past medical history includes generalized anxiety disorder, for which she currently takes no medication. The patient had been previously medicated with paroxetine for 5 years. On physical examination, several areas of point tenderness are found on the occipital region, elbows, and medial surface of both knees. Laboratory work up is unremarkable. What is the best treatment option for the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Paroxetine.

Based on the patient's symptoms, including chronic widespread pain, sleeping issues, and point tenderness in specific areas, the most likely diagnosis is fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances.

The patient's past medical history of generalized anxiety disorder and previous treatment with paroxetine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI) is relevant. SSRIs, such as paroxetine, are commonly used to treat fibromyalgia, as they can help alleviate pain, improve sleep, and reduce anxiety.

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommends pharmacological treatment for fibromyalgia, including SSRIs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and gabapentin/pregabalin. Among the options, paroxetine is the most suitable choice for this patient, given her previous response to the medication and the lack of other contraindications.

The other options are not supported by current guidelines for fibromyalgia treatment:

A. Low-dose prednisolone: Corticosteroids are not recommended for fibromyalgia treatment, as they may exacerbate the condition.

B. High-dose prednisolone: Similarly, high-dose corticosteroids are not indicated for fibromyalgia and may lead to adverse effects.

D. Allopurinol: This medication is typically used to treat gout, not fibromyalgia.

E. Gabapentin: While gabapentin is sometimes used to treat fibromyalgia, it is not the best choice for this patient, given her previous response to paroxetine.",Success
"A 3rd year resident in good standing with his residency training program would like to work more hours outside his residency obligations to gain more experience and pay for his medical school loans. He currently works and trains 60 hours per week as a resident and has a 10-hour shift external to his residency program on Saturdays. He is free of any educational and work obligations on Sundays. Based on the most recent standards set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding this resident’s moonlighting and patient safety?",C,"The correct answer is D. He may work more hours on Sundays.

According to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) guidelines, residents are allowed to moonlight, or work outside of their residency program, as long as they meet certain conditions. One of the key requirements is that the resident must not exceed 80 hours of work per week, averaged over a 4-week period.

In this scenario, the resident is already working 60 hours per week as a resident and has a 10-hour shift on Saturdays, which totals 70 hours per week. Since the resident is free of any educational and work obligations on Sundays, they may work additional hours on Sundays to gain more experience and income, as long as they do not exceed the 80-hour weekly limit.

The other options are incorrect:

A. The resident is not necessarily overcommitting, as they are still below the 80-hour weekly limit.

B. The resident is allowed to work outside the scope of their residency training, as long as they meet the ACGME guidelines for moonlighting.

C. The resident may not work longer shifts, as this could compromise patient safety and exceed the weekly hour limit.

E. The resident may not work up to 20 more hours, as this would exceed the 80-hour weekly limit.",Success
"A 29-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. On presentation, he is found to have scalp and trunk lacerations that are still actively bleeding. He has no past medical history and does not take any medications. On presentation, his temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 110/74 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical exam, he is found to be anxious but does not have any visible injuries other than the lacerations. Which of the following processes would most likely be seen in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Increased norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node.

The patient in this scenario is experiencing anxiety and has a normal blood pressure, which suggests that he is in a state of sympathetic activation, also known as the ""fight or flight"" response. This response is triggered by the body's response to stress, injury, or trauma, and is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system.

In this state, the sympathetic nervous system releases norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates the sinoatrial (SA) node, increasing heart rate and contractility. This is a normal response to stress and helps to increase blood pressure and perfusion to vital organs.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's presentation:

A. Baroreceptor-mediated vasodilation would occur in response to high blood pressure, which is not present in this patient.

B. Chemoreceptor-mediated vasoconstriction is a response to changes in blood pH or oxygen levels, which is not relevant to this patient's presentation.

C. Increased acetylcholine at the sinoatrial node would slow down the heart rate, which is not consistent with the patient's normal heart rate.

D. Increased atrial natriuretic peptide release is a response to increased blood pressure, which is not present in this patient.

Therefore, the correct answer is E. Increased norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node, which is consistent with the patient's sympathetic activation and anxiety.",Success

What is the necessary treatment?",D,"The correct answer is D. Surgical resection.

Let's break down the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings to understand the diagnosis and necessary treatment:

**Symptoms:**

* Frequent headaches and excessive fatigue
* Weight gain despite a healthy diet
* Frequent urination
* Short stature and overweight appearance
* Nonpitting edema and decreased reflexes
* Orthostatic hypotension (systolic blood pressure drops by 20 mm Hg when standing)
* Papilledema and bitemporal hemianopsia (visual field defects)

**Laboratory findings:**

* Elevated BUN and creatinine (indicating kidney dysfunction)
* Hypoglycemia (low blood glucose)
* Hypochloremia (low serum chloride)
* Hypokalemia (low serum potassium)
* Hyponatremia (low serum sodium)
* Metabolic acidosis (low bicarbonate)
* Suppressed TSH and low free T4 (indicating hypothyroidism)

**Diagnosis:**

Based on the symptoms and laboratory findings, the likely diagnosis is a pituitary tumor, specifically a non-functioning pituitary adenoma or a craniopharyngioma, which is compressing the pituitary gland and hypothalamus. This compression leads to:

* Hypopituitarism (deficiency of pituitary hormones, including thyroid-stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and growth hormone)
* Hypersecretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), causing hyponatremia and water retention
* Visual field defects and papilledema due to compression of the optic chiasm

**Treatment:**

The necessary treatment is surgical resection of the pituitary tumor to relieve compression on the pituitary gland and surrounding structures. This will help to restore normal pituitary function, alleviate symptoms, and prevent further complications.

Hormone replacement therapy (Option E) may be necessary after surgery to replace deficient hormones, but it is not the primary treatment. Chemotherapy and radiation (Options A, B, and C) are not indicated for a non-malignant pituitary tumor.",Success
"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?",E,"The correct answer is E. A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.

Here's why:

* Northern blot is used to detect RNA, whereas HIF-1α is a protein. So, options A and B are incorrect.
* Southern blot is used to detect DNA, whereas HIF-1α is a protein. So, options C and D are incorrect.
* Western blot (also known as immunoblot) is used to detect proteins, which makes it the appropriate technique to detect HIF-1α.
* In RCC, HIF-1α is not degraded due to the inhibition of VHL-mediated hydroxylation, even in normoxic conditions. This means that HIF-1α will accumulate and be detectable in a Western blot.
* Compared to a normoxic control cell, where HIF-1α would be degraded, the RCC cell would show increased HIF-1α protein levels.

She has no history of convulsive disorders and the antepartum course has been unremarkable. She was compliant with the recommended prenatal care and her last prenatal visit was 2 weeks ago. She has gained 2 kg (4.4 lb) since her last visit. The blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, the heart rate was 79/min, the respiratory rate was 14/min, and the temperature was 37.0℃ (98.6℉). The physical examination shows leg and perineal edema. The neurologic examination is significant for symmetric upper and lower extremity hyperreflexia and ankle clonus. Which of the following laboratory findings would be most common in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Proteinuria.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related hypertensive disorder characterized by high blood pressure and damage to organs such as the kidneys and liver. The patient's headache, seizure, and hyperreflexia are all indicative of severe preeclampsia.

Proteinuria is a hallmark feature of preeclampsia, and it is estimated that up to 90% of women with preeclampsia will have proteinuria (1). The presence of protein in the urine is a sign of kidney damage and dysfunction.

The other options are not as likely to be present in this patient:

A. Elevated transaminases may be seen in patients with preeclampsia, but it is not as common as proteinuria. Liver dysfunction can occur in preeclampsia, but it is typically seen in more severe cases.

"A 3-year-old male is brought by his mother to the pediatrician's office. The mother and child are refugees from Somalia and arrived in the United States one week ago. They were recently placed in temporary housing. The mother reports that the child has been chronically tired and subdued since before their arrival in the United States. The child was born at 38 weeks gestation with the help of a local midwife. The child’s temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 105/60 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination reveals a listless child with a rotund abdomen and positive fluid wave. Notable lower extremity edema is present. This patient's condition is most likely caused by a deficiency in which of the following?",B,"The correct answer is B. Relative protein intake.

The patient's symptoms, such as chronic tiredness, subdued behavior, rotund abdomen, and lower extremity edema, are consistent with a diagnosis of kwashiorkor, a type of protein-energy malnutrition. Kwashiorkor is often seen in children who have a diet that is deficient in protein but has sufficient calories, leading to an imbalance in nutrient intake.

The physical examination findings, including the fluid wave and edema, are also characteristic of kwashiorkor. The fluid wave is a sign of ascites, which is a common complication of kwashiorkor.

Option A, total caloric intake, is unlikely to be the primary cause of the patient's condition, as the child's abdomen is rotund, suggesting that they are consuming sufficient calories. Options C and D, relative carbohydrate and fat intake, are also unlikely to be the primary cause, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a protein deficiency. Option E, vitamin intake, may be a contributing factor, but it is not the primary cause of the patient's condition.

It's worth noting that kwashiorkor is often seen in areas with limited access to nutrient-rich food, and refugees may be at higher risk due to food insecurity and displacement. The patient's recent arrival in the United States and placement in temporary housing may have contributed to their nutritional deficiencies.",Success
"A 42-year-old woman presents to her obstetrician for a prenatal care appointment at 10 weeks gestation.

On physical exam, you notice a gravid uterus 10 cm above the pubic symphysis. The patient's external genitalia appear within normal limits. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",B,"The correct answer is E. Regular follow-up appointments.

At 10 weeks gestation, the patient is in her first trimester, and the primary focus is on monitoring fetal growth, detecting any potential complications, and providing prenatal care. The patient's symptoms of nausea and vomiting are common during this stage, and she is already taking prenatal vitamins and folate supplements, which is appropriate.

The other options are not the next best step in management at this stage:

A. Amniocentesis is typically performed between 15-20 weeks gestation to detect chromosomal abnormalities and is not indicated at 10 weeks.

B. Cell-free DNA testing (cfDNA) is a non-invasive prenatal test that can detect chromosomal abnormalities, but it is usually performed between 10-22 weeks gestation, and the results may not be available for several days. While cfDNA testing may be offered to the patient, it is not the next best step in management.

C. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is an invasive procedure that can detect chromosomal abnormalities and is typically performed between 10-13 weeks gestation. However, it is not necessary at this point, and the patient's symptoms do not indicate any concerns that would warrant CVS.

D. Iron and vitamin D supplementation may be necessary later in pregnancy, but it is not the next best step in management at 10 weeks gestation. The patient is already taking prenatal vitamins and folate supplements, which is appropriate.

Regular follow-up appointments (Option E) are essential to monitor the patient's progress, detect any potential complications, and provide ongoing prenatal care.

Abdominal examination shows hepatosplenomegaly and shifting dullness; there is mild tenderness to palpation. Examination of the skin shows multiple nonblanching maculae. A CT scan of the abdomen shows mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement and nodular thickening of the omentum.

Immunohistochemical staining of the Ki-67 nuclear antigen shows that the proliferation index of the specimen is > 99%. The structure indicated by the arrows is most likely which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is D. Macrophage.

The photomicrograph of the biopsy specimen from the enlarged mesenteric lymph node shows a cluster of cells with abundant cytoplasm and irregular nuclei, which are characteristic features of macrophages. The presence of multiple nonblanching maculae on the skin, also known as petechiae, suggests a bleeding disorder, which is consistent with the diagnosis of a hematopoietic malignancy.

The clinical presentation of abdominal distention, fatigue, night sweats, post-prandial fullness, and recurrent nonbilious vomiting, along with the CT scan findings of mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement and nodular thickening of the omentum, suggests a diagnosis of lymphoma.

The high proliferation index (> 99%) on immunohistochemical staining of the Ki-67 nuclear antigen further supports the diagnosis of a highly proliferative malignancy, such as lymphoma.

Macrophages are a type of immune cell that can be involved in various malignancies, including lymphoma. In this case, the macrophages are likely to be malignant, contributing to the development of the lymphoma.

The other options are not supported by the clinical presentation and histopathological findings:

A. Neutrophil: Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that are not typically associated with lymphoma.

B. Human immunodeficiency virus: While HIV can increase the risk of developing lymphoma, it is not a direct cause of the disease.

Coagulation tests are conducted with the following results:

Bleeding time: 3 minutes
Prothrombin time: 11 seconds
Partial thromboplastin time: 53 seconds
Bradykinin formation: decreased

Which of the following factors is most likely defective in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Factor XII.

Here's why:

The patient's coagulation test results are:

* Bleeding time: 3 minutes (normal)
* Prothrombin time (PT): 11 seconds (normal)
* Partial thromboplastin time (PTT): 53 seconds (prolonged)
* Bradykinin formation: decreased

The prolonged PTT suggests a defect in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. The normal PT and bleeding time rule out defects in the extrinsic pathway (Factor VII) and platelet function, respectively.

The decreased bradykinin formation is a key clue, as bradykinin is a byproduct of the contact activation pathway, which involves Factor XII (Hageman factor). Factor XII is the initiating factor in the intrinsic pathway, and its deficiency can lead to a prolonged PTT.

The other options are unlikely:

* Factor VII (A) is part of the extrinsic pathway, which is not affected in this patient.
* Factor VIII (B) and Factor IX (C) are both involved in the intrinsic pathway, but their deficiencies would typically present with a more severe bleeding disorder, such as hemophilia A or B.
* Factor X (D) is part of the common pathway and would affect both PT and PTT, which is not the case here.

Therefore, the most likely defective factor in this patient is Factor XII (E).",Success

If the patient's bladder finding is caused by a vitamin deficiency, which of the following features is also most likely to be seen?",D,"The correct answer is D. Night blindness.

The patient's bladder finding, characterized by pearl-like plaques on the bladder wall and biopsy showing focal layer of stratified squamous epithelium with hyperkeratosis, is consistent with a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency-induced cystitis. This is a rare complication of Crohn disease, particularly in patients receiving infliximab.

Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause a range of symptoms, including neurological, hematological, and gastrointestinal manifestations. One of the key features of vitamin B12 deficiency is impaired vision, which can progress to night blindness. This is due to the role of vitamin B12 in the metabolism of fatty acids, which is essential for the maintenance of the myelin sheath surrounding nerve fibers, including those in the optic nerve.

The other options are not directly related to vitamin B12 deficiency:

A. Carpopedal spasm is a feature of hypocalcemia, not vitamin B12 deficiency.

B. Perifollicular hemorrhage is a feature of vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), not vitamin B12 deficiency.

The pelvic examination reveals cervical softening and shortening. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a cervical length of 12 mm, which is consistent with preterm labor. A tocolytic and a single dose of betamethasone are administered. Betamethasone stimulates which fetal cells?",D,"The correct answer is D. Type II pneumocytes.

Betamethasone, a corticosteroid, is administered to the mother to promote fetal lung maturity in cases of preterm labor. It stimulates the production of surfactant by Type II pneumocytes in the fetal lungs. Surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that reduces the surface tension of alveolar fluid, allowing for easier expansion of the lungs after birth. By stimulating the production of surfactant, betamethasone helps to reduce the risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants.

The other options are not directly related to the effect of betamethasone on fetal lung maturity:

A. Type I pneumocytes are the primary epithelial cells lining the alveoli, but they are not directly involved in surfactant production.

B. Goblet cells are mucin-producing cells found in the respiratory epithelium, but they are not related to surfactant production or fetal lung maturity.

C. Bronchial epithelial cells are involved in the production of mucus, but they are not directly related to surfactant production or fetal lung maturity.

E. Vascular smooth myocytes are involved in the regulation of blood vessel tone, but they are not related to surfactant production or fetal lung maturity.

His current medications include lisinopril, metformin, and azithromycin. He has no sign of injury, and he appears well. During the examination, he loses consciousness again. Telemetry shows polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis, which spontaneously resolves after 30 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's syncope?",C,"The correct answer is A. Hypomagnesemia.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, particularly the polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis, are consistent with torsades de pointes (TdP), a type of ventricular tachycardia. TdP is often associated with prolonged QT intervals, but in this case, the option C is not the most likely cause.

The key to this question is the patient's medication list, which includes azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic that can prolong the QT interval. However, azithromycin is not typically associated with TdP. The more likely culprit is hypomagnesemia, which is a common electrolyte imbalance that can occur in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, and those taking certain medications, like diuretics.

Hypomagnesemia can cause QT prolongation and increase the risk of TdP. In this patient, the combination of azithromycin and possible hypomagnesemia may have contributed to the development of TdP.

Brugada syndrome (option B) is a genetic disorder that can cause VT and sudden cardiac death, but it is not typically associated with QT prolongation or TdP.

Accessory conduction pathways (option D) are more commonly associated with supraventricular tachycardias, not VT or TdP.

Hyperkalemia (option E) can cause cardiac arrhythmias, but it is not typically associated with TdP or QT prolongation.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms, medication list, and the presence of TdP, hypomagnesemia is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's syncope.",Success
"A 56-year-old patient is being treated with oral amoxicillin for community-acquired pneumonia. The plasma clearance of the drug is calculated as 15.0 L/h. Oral bioavailability of the drug is 75%. Sensitivity analysis of a sputum culture shows a minimal inhibitory concentration of 1 μg/mL for the causative pathogen. The target plasma concentration is 2 mg/L. If the drug is administered twice per day, which of the following dosages should be administered at each dosing interval to maintain a steady state?",B,"To determine the correct dosage, we need to calculate the required dose using the given information.

First, let's break down the given information:

1. Plasma clearance (CL) = 15.0 L/h
2. Oral bioavailability (F) = 75% = 0.75
3. Target plasma concentration (Cp) = 2 mg/L
4. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 1 μg/mL = 1 mg/L (since 1 μg/mL is equivalent to 1 mg/L)
5. Dosing frequency = twice per day

To calculate the dose, we can use the following formula:

Dose = (CL × Cp × τ) / (F × bioavailability)

where τ is the dosing interval. Since the patient is taking the medication twice a day, the dosing interval is 12 hours = 0.5 days = 12 hours / 24 hours/day = 0.5 days.

First, let's convert the plasma clearance from L/h to L/day:
CL (L/day) = 15.0 L/h × 24 h/day = 360 L/day

Now, plug in the values:

Dose = (360 L/day × 2 mg/L × 0.5 days) / (0.75 × 1)
Dose = 480 mg

The symptoms described in the question, such as difficulty passing urine, lower abdominal pain, and a burning sensation while urinating, are consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI). The urinalysis results, including the presence of red blood cells (RBCs) and casts, support this diagnosis.

The pediatrician's suspicion of a double-stranded DNA virus suggests that the infection is caused by adenovirus, which is a common cause of UTIs in children. Adenovirus is also associated with a vesicular rash, known as pharyngoconjunctival fever.

"A 46-year-old woman presents with difficulty initiating sleep, as well as frequent nighttime awakenings. She reports making multiple mistakes at her office job, has an inability to concentrate, and feels sleepy throughout the day. She is worried that her sleeping troubles will cause her to get fired. Which of the following would best treat this patient’s insomnia pharmacologically?",C,"The correct answer is C. Triazolam.

This patient is experiencing symptoms of insomnia, including difficulty initiating sleep and frequent nighttime awakenings, which are affecting her daily life and causing daytime sleepiness, impaired concentration, and mistakes at work. 

Triazolam is a benzodiazepine that is specifically approved for the short-term treatment of insomnia. It has a rapid onset of action and a short half-life, making it suitable for inducing sleep quickly and reducing the risk of daytime sedation.

Citalopram (Option A) is an antidepressant that may cause insomnia as a side effect, rather than treating it.

Chlordiazepoxide (Option B) is a benzodiazepine with a longer half-life than triazolam, which increases the risk of daytime sedation and dependence.

Diazepam (Option D) is a benzodiazepine with an even longer half-life than chlordiazepoxide, making it less suitable for treating insomnia.

Modafinil (Option E) is a wakefulness-promoting agent used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, or shift work sleep disorder. It is not indicated for the treatment of insomnia.

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends benzodiazepine receptor agonists, such as triazolam, as a treatment option for insomnia. However, it's essential to note that pharmacological treatment should be used in conjunction with behavioral therapies, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), and that the patient should be monitored for potential side effects and dependence.",Success
"A 5-year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician for evaluation of difficulties noted at school. Her kindergarten teacher voiced her concern that the child ‘spaces out’ often and thinks she may have ADHD. The parents deny any history of head trauma or infection. Her blood pressure is 106/74 mm Hg, the heart rate is 69/min, and the respiratory rate is 14/min. Physical exam demonstrates a happy child who has reached developmental milestones. Laboratory results are within normal limits. EEG demonstrates a 3-Hz spike and wave pattern (see image). The decision is made to start the child on medical therapy. What should be advised to the parents as a potential side effect of the first-line medication?",B,"The correct answer is B. GI upset.

The EEG result showing a 3-Hz spike and wave pattern is consistent with a diagnosis of childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). The first-line medication for CAE is typically ethosuximide or valproic acid. Both of these medications can cause gastrointestinal (GI) upset, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, as a potential side effect.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Nystagmus is a side effect of certain anticonvulsant medications, such as phenytoin, but it is not typically associated with ethosuximide or valproic acid.

C. Facial rash and blood in the urine are not typical side effects of ethosuximide or valproic acid. A rash can be a side effect of some anticonvulsants, but it is not specific to these medications, and blood in the urine is not a common side effect of either ethosuximide or valproic acid.

D. Profound leukopenia (a decrease in white blood cell count) is not a typical side effect of ethosuximide or valproic acid. Valproic acid can cause thrombocytopenia (a decrease in platelet count), but leukopenia is not a common side effect of either medication.

E. Weight gain and change in hair color are not typical side effects of ethosuximide or valproic acid. Valproic acid can cause weight gain, but it is not a common side effect of ethosuximide, and changes in hair color are not typically associated with either medication.

It's essential to advise the parents about the potential side effects of the medication to ensure they can monitor their child's response and report any concerns to the pediatrician.",Success
"A 75-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past month. He reports that he cannot climb more than one flight of stairs without experiencing shortness of breath and dizziness. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. He does not drink alcohol. His medications include enalapril, atorvastatin, and low-dose aspirin. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows weak peripheral pulses. Cardiac examination is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Aortic valve stenosis.

The patient's symptoms of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue, along with the physical examination findings, are consistent with aortic valve stenosis. The patient's weak peripheral pulses and the cardiac examination findings of a harsh, late-peaking systolic murmur heard loudest at the right upper sternal border are characteristic of aortic valve stenosis.

Aortic valve stenosis is a common condition in elderly patients, particularly those with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient's 50-year history of smoking also increases his risk for cardiovascular disease.

The other options can be ruled out based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Aortic valve regurgitation would typically cause a diastolic murmur, not a systolic murmur.

B. Tricuspid valve stenosis is a rare condition that would typically cause signs and symptoms of right-sided heart failure, such as peripheral edema and jugular venous distension, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

C. Mitral valve prolapse would typically cause a mid-systolic click or murmur, not a harsh, late-peaking systolic murmur.

D. Mitral valve stenosis would typically cause signs and symptoms of left-sided heart failure, such as orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend that patients with suspected aortic valve stenosis undergo echocardiography to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the stenosis.",Success
A 56-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 1 week after a temporal artery biopsy was performed to evaluate headache and blurry vision. He has a 12-year history of hypertension treated with lisinopril. Results of the testing show decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this finding?,C,"The correct answer is D. Decreased production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as headache and blurry vision, suggest a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA), which is a type of vasculitis that affects the temporal arteries. The biopsy results showing decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells are consistent with this diagnosis.

Arginine is a precursor to nitric oxide (NO), which is a potent vasodilator. In healthy endothelial cells, arginine is converted to NO through the action of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NO then stimulates the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which relaxes vascular smooth muscle and causes vasodilation.

In GCA, the inflammation and damage to the endothelial cells lead to a decrease in arginine availability, which in turn reduces NO production. As a result, there is a decrease in cGMP production, leading to vasoconstriction and contributing to the patient's symptoms.

The other options are not directly related to the pathophysiology of GCA or the effects of decreased arginine concentrations:

A. Increased binding of calcium to calmodulin is involved in smooth muscle contraction, but it's not directly related to the decreased arginine concentrations.

B. Increased phosphorylation of myosin is involved in smooth muscle contraction, but it's not directly related to the decreased arginine concentrations.

C. Increased production of nitric oxide would actually increase cGMP production, not decrease it.

E. Decreased concentration of bradykinin is not directly related to the pathophysiology of GCA or the effects of decreased arginine concentrations.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Decreased production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate.",Success
"While traveling abroad a physician is asked to attend a meeting regarding healthcare in the region. The rate of chlamydial infection is exceptionally high in the area, and the local government is wanting to test a new treatment for these infections. To test the new therapy, the physician is asked to oversee the operations of testing this new treatment. When asking what this would entail, the officials tell the physician that they plan to infect the local prison population with chlamydia and then test the new treatment on these individuals. Which of the following is the best response from the physician?",D,"The correct answer is D. “I can not help you due to the ethical principle of nonmaleficence.”

The ethical principle of nonmaleficence is the obligation to do no harm or to avoid causing harm to others. In this scenario, intentionally infecting the local prison population with chlamydia would be a clear violation of this principle. It is unethical to deliberately cause harm or put individuals at risk of harm, especially when they are vulnerable populations such as prisoners.

The other options are not correct:

A. Autonomy refers to the individual's right to make informed decisions about their own healthcare. While autonomy is an important ethical principle, it is not directly applicable in this scenario.

B. Accepting the proposal would be unethical and violate the principle of nonmaleficence.

C. Justice refers to the fair distribution of resources and opportunities. While justice is an important ethical principle, it is not directly relevant to this scenario.

E. Beneficence refers to the obligation to do good and promote the well-being of others. While beneficence is an important ethical principle, it is not directly applicable in this scenario, as the proposed action would cause harm rather than promote well-being.

It is essential for healthcare professionals to uphold ethical principles, and in this case, the physician should refuse to participate in the proposed study due to the violation of the principle of nonmaleficence.",Success
"A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 7-day history of progressively worsening shortness of breath. She has a history of asthma and has frequent exacerbations despite receiving maximal medical therapy. Physical examination shows scattered expiratory wheezing. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 9,800/mm3 (13% eosinophils) and elevated serum concentration of immunoglobulin E. An x-ray of the chest shows thickened bronchial walls and perihilar opacities. Sputum culture shows scattered septate hyphae that branch at 45 degrees. Which of the following is most likely to be increased in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. IL-4.

The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and radiographic findings are consistent with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), a condition characterized by an allergic reaction to Aspergillus fumigatus in the lungs. The presence of eosinophils, elevated IgE levels, and septate hyphae in the sputum culture support this diagnosis.

Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a cytokine that plays a key role in the allergic response and is typically elevated in ABPA. IL-4 promotes the production of IgE, which is elevated in this patient, and also contributes to the recruitment of eosinophils to the lungs.

The other options are not directly related to ABPA or the allergic response:

A. IL-28 is involved in the immune response to viral infections, but it is not specifically associated with ABPA.

B. C5a is a component of the complement system and is involved in inflammation, but it is not directly related to the allergic response in ABPA.

C. TGF-β is a cytokine involved in tissue repair and remodeling, but it is not typically associated with ABPA.

D. IFN-α is involved in the immune response to viral infections and is not directly related to ABPA.

"A 29-year-old G1P0 female presents at 22 weeks gestation for her first prenatal care appointment. Physical exam demonstrates a uterine size greater than expected for her gestational age and taut, shiny skin with scattered striae on her abdomen. Ultrasound examination of the fetus reveals 2.5 L of amniotic fluid (normal 1.5-2.0 L) with an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 34 (normal AFI 20-25). Which of the following fetal abnormalities or dysfunctions could have contributed to these abnormal ultrasound findings?",C,"The correct answer is C. Duodenal atresia.

The patient's physical exam findings of a uterine size greater than expected for her gestational age and taut, shiny skin with scattered striae on her abdomen suggest polyhydramnios (excessive amniotic fluid). The ultrasound examination confirms this with an amniotic fluid volume of 2.5 L, which is above the normal range of 1.5-2.0 L, and an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 34, which is also above the normal range of 20-25.

Polyhydramnios can be caused by various fetal abnormalities or dysfunctions that lead to increased urine production or swallowing of amniotic fluid. In this case, the correct answer is duodenal atresia, a congenital intestinal obstruction that can cause polyhydramnios due to the fetus swallowing more amniotic fluid than usual.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Renal agenesis would lead to oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid) rather than polyhydramnios, as the fetus would not be producing enough urine.

B. Pulmonary hypoplasia is not directly related to amniotic fluid volume.

D. Posterior urethral valve would also lead to oligohydramnios due to reduced urine production.

E. Polycystic kidney disease may cause oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios, but it is not the most likely cause of polyhydramnios in this scenario, given the presence of a uterine size greater than expected for gestational age and taut, shiny skin with scattered striae on the abdomen.

It's essential to note that polyhydramnios can be a sign of various underlying conditions, and a thorough evaluation, including ultrasound and other diagnostic tests, is necessary to determine the underlying cause.",Success
"A 68-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with chest pain. She reports sudden severe and crushing substernal chest pain that started 1 hour ago. Her past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and a prior myocardial infarction requiring a coronary artery bypass graft 2 years ago. She takes aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, spironolactone, atorvastatin, and insulin. She is retired and lives a sedentary lifestyle at home. Her temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 109/68 mmHg, pulse is 118/min, and respirations are 24/min. Before being able to start the physical examination, the patient loses consciousness. Her pulse is palpable but weak. Her blood pressure is now 88/50 mmHg and pulse is 130/min. Her skin is pale, cold, and clammy. An electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in leads I, aVL, V3, V4, V5, and V6. A medication that primarily stimulates which of the following receptors would be most appropriate to improve the hemodynamic status of this patient?",C,"The correct answer is A. Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor.

The patient is presenting with symptoms of cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased peripheral perfusion (pale, cold, and clammy skin) indicate a state of inadequate cardiac output.

In this scenario, a medication that stimulates the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor would be most appropriate to improve the patient's hemodynamic status. Alpha-1 agonists, such as phenylephrine or norepinephrine, cause vasoconstriction, which would help increase the patient's blood pressure and improve peripheral perfusion. This is particularly important in cardiogenic shock, where the goal is to increase peripheral resistance to help maintain blood pressure and ensure adequate organ perfusion.

In contrast, beta-1 adrenergic receptor stimulation (option C) would increase heart rate and contractility, which may not be beneficial in this scenario, as the patient is already tachycardic. Beta-2 adrenergic receptor stimulation (option D) would cause vasodilation, which would worsen the patient's hypotension. Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor stimulation (option B) would decrease sympathetic outflow and worsen the patient's hemodynamic status. D2 receptor stimulation (option E) is not relevant to this scenario, as it is primarily involved in dopamine-mediated neurotransmission.

It's worth noting that the patient's electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in multiple leads, indicating a possible acute myocardial infarction. However, the primary concern in this scenario is the patient's hemodynamic instability, which requires immediate attention.",Success
"A 4-year-old child is rushed to the emergency department after developing sudden abdominal pain followed by nausea, vomiting, and dark, almost black-colored stool. Prior to the onset of symptoms, he was seen playing with his mother’s purse containing a bottle of vitamin supplements, which she takes for chronic microcytic anemia. Which of the following medications is the treatment for this patient's intoxication?",C,"The correct answer is C. Deferoxamine.

Based on the symptoms described, it is likely that the child has ingested iron supplements from the mother's purse, leading to iron toxicity. The dark, almost black-colored stool is a characteristic feature of iron poisoning.

Deferoxamine is a specific chelating agent used to treat iron toxicity. It works by binding to iron in the bloodstream, forming a complex that can be excreted in the urine, thereby reducing the toxic effects of iron.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Dimercaprol (BAL) is a chelating agent used to treat poisoning from heavy metals like lead, arsenic, and mercury, but not iron.

B. Penicillamine is a chelating agent used to treat copper toxicity, such as in Wilson's disease, and is not effective in iron toxicity.

D. Protamine is an antidote used to reverse the effects of heparin, an anticoagulant, and is not related to iron toxicity.

E. Succimer (DMSA) is a chelating agent used to treat lead poisoning, not iron toxicity.

It's essential to note that iron toxicity can be life-threatening, and prompt medical attention is crucial. Deferoxamine should be administered under the guidance of a healthcare professional, and supportive care, such as gastrointestinal decontamination, fluid management, and monitoring for complications, should also be provided.",Success
"A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, breast tenderness, increased urinary frequency, and intermittent nausea for 2 weeks. Her last menstrual period was 7 weeks ago. She has a history of a seizure disorder treated with carbamazepine. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is positive. The child is at greatest risk of developing which of the following complications?",B,"The correct answer is B. Meningocele.

The patient's history of taking carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant medication, during pregnancy increases the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in the fetus. Carbamazepine is a known teratogen, and its use during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of NTDs, including meningomyelocele (a type of spina bifida) and meningocele.

Meningocele is a type of NTD where the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the spinal cord, protrude through a defect in the vertebrae. This can occur in the spine or skull.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's medication use during pregnancy:

A. Renal dysplasia is a congenital abnormality of the kidneys, but it is not specifically associated with carbamazepine use.

C. Teeth discoloration is a potential side effect of tetracycline antibiotics, not carbamazepine.

D. Sensorineural hearing loss is not a known complication of carbamazepine use during pregnancy.

E. Vaginal clear cell carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that has been associated with in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), not carbamazepine.

It's essential to note that carbamazepine is considered a category D medication in pregnancy, meaning there is positive evidence of human fetal risk. If possible, alternative medications should be considered for seizure control during pregnancy.",Success
"Three patients present to the pediatrician for routine well-child visits. The first child’s mother reports that he seems to be breastfeeding well and voids at least eight times per day. His stools are a yellow color, and he does not seem to be straining. In the office, he can lift his head and chest when in the prone position, and he can track an object with his eyes to the midline. His hands remain fisted 50% of the time.

The second child’s parents report that she is doing well at home and seems to enjoy playing with her older brother. In the office, she can roll from supine to prone and can transfer her rattle from hand to hand. She cannot yet say any words.

The third child’s father reports that he is starting to explore the world around him. He has begun taking independent steps at home. In the office, he seems to recognize the name of several objects, but he cannot follow the direction to “grab the ball.” All three children are assessed as developmentally normal.

Which of the following represents these patient's respective ages?",E,"The correct answer is C. Ages 2 months, 4 months, and 12 months.

Here's a breakdown of each child's developmental milestones and their corresponding ages:

1. The first child:
	* Breastfeeding well and voiding at least eight times per day suggests adequate hydration and nutrition.
	* Yellow-colored stools and no straining indicate normal bowel movements.
	* Lifting head and chest while in the prone position indicates good neck strength and control.
	* Tracking an object with eyes to the midline suggests normal visual development.
	* Hands remaining fisted 50% of the time is a normal finding at this age.

These milestones are consistent with a 2-month-old infant.

2. The second child:
	* Rolling from supine to prone indicates good upper body strength and coordination.
	* Transferring a rattle from hand to hand suggests developing hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills.
	* Not saying any words is normal at this age, as language development typically begins around 6-9 months.

These milestones are consistent with a 4-month-old infant.

3. The third child:
	* Taking independent steps indicates good gross motor skills and coordination.
	* Recognizing the names of several objects suggests developing cognitive skills and memory.
	* Not following the direction to ""grab the ball"" may indicate a slight delay in language comprehension, but it's still within the normal range for this age.

These milestones are consistent with a 12-month-old toddler.

Her temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 184/111 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with normal strength and sensation in the patient's upper and lower extremities. The patient's memory is intact and her speech seems normal and fluent. Her gait is stable with no ataxia. An initial head CT demonstrates diffuse atrophy which is consistent with previous head CT scans. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is C. Echocardiogram.

The patient's symptoms, although transient, are concerning for a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or a minor ischemic stroke. Given her history of atrial fibrillation, it is essential to evaluate the possibility of a cardioembolic event. An echocardiogram is a non-invasive test that can help identify potential cardiac sources of embolism, such as left atrial thrombus or patent foramen ovale.

Alteplase (A) is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient's symptoms have resolved, and the window for thrombolytic therapy has likely passed.

CT angiogram (B) may be useful in evaluating the patient's cerebrovascular anatomy, but it is not the next best step in management. The patient's symptoms have resolved, and the initial head CT did not show any acute changes.

Heparin (D) may be considered for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation patients, but it is not the best next step in this scenario. The patient's symptoms have resolved, and the focus should be on evaluating the underlying cause of the TIA.

MRI (E) may be useful in evaluating the patient's brain parenchyma, but it is not the best next step in management. The initial head CT did not show any acute changes, and an echocardiogram is a more critical test to evaluate the cardiac source of embolism.

The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines recommend that patients with TIA or minor ischemic stroke undergo echocardiography to evaluate for cardiac sources of embolism.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with weakness. He states that it started yesterday and has been progressively worsening.

The patient works as a farmer and harvests and cans his own foods. He has had diarrhea recently and a cough prior to these symptoms of weakness. His temperature is 97.9°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 144/94 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a man who seems unable to smile with dysarthric speech. He takes shallow and weak breaths on pulmonary exam. The patient demonstrates 3/5 strength with diminished reflexes in his upper extremities. The patient is subsequently intubated. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Antitoxin.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the likely diagnosis is botulism. The patient's history of canning his own foods and recent diarrhea and cough suggest the possibility of foodborne botulism. The symptoms of blurry vision, trouble speaking and swallowing, weakness of facial muscles, and shortness of breath are all consistent with botulism.

Botulism is a neurotoxic disorder caused by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The treatment of choice for botulism is antitoxin, which is a horse-derived antiserum that can neutralize the botulinum toxin. Antitoxin is most effective when administered early in the course of the disease, and it can help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms.

Atropine (option B) is not a treatment for botulism. While it may be used to treat certain symptoms such as bradycardia, it is not effective against the botulinum toxin.

Neostigmine (option C) is a medication used to treat myasthenia gravis, a different neurological disorder characterized by muscle weakness. It is not effective against botulism.

Plasmapheresis (option D) is a treatment that may be used for certain neurological disorders, but it is not a recommended treatment for botulism.

Riluzole (option E) is a medication used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a different neurological disorder. It is not effective against botulism.

A 79-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of difficulty starting urination and a vague sensation of fullness in the pelvis. Pelvic speculum examination in the lithotomy position shows a pink structure at the vaginal introitus that protrudes from the anterior vaginal wall when the patient is asked to cough. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?,C,"The correct answer is C. Cystocele.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as difficulty starting urination and a sensation of fullness in the pelvis, are consistent with a cystocele. A cystocele is a type of pelvic organ prolapse where the bladder bulges into the vagina, causing urinary symptoms. The pelvic speculum examination finding of a pink structure protruding from the anterior vaginal wall when the patient coughs further supports this diagnosis.

Uterine prolapse (Option A) would typically present with a bulge or mass in the vagina, but it would not specifically cause urinary symptoms or protrude from the anterior vaginal wall.

Vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma (Option B) is a rare type of cancer that would not typically present with urinary symptoms or a pink, bulging structure in the vagina.

Rectocele (Option D) is a type of pelvic organ prolapse where the rectum bulges into the vagina, causing bowel symptoms such as constipation or difficulty with bowel movements. It would not typically cause urinary symptoms or protrude from the anterior vaginal wall.

Uterine leiomyomata (Option E) are benign tumors of the uterus that can cause pelvic pressure or discomfort, but they would not typically cause urinary symptoms or protrude from the anterior vaginal wall.

"A 30-year-old woman presents to the physician because of ongoing diarrhea for the past 1 month. She reports that diarrhea has been intermittently present for the past month. The stool is often loose and associated with blood and lower abdominal pain. She denies any recent travel history, and she works at a nursing home as a caretaker. She is not currently on any medications. Clinical examination shows mild tenderness in the suprapubic region, and there is no organomegaly. Findings on colonoscopy include patchy erythema and ulceration in the cecum, ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon. Mucosal biopsy shows colonic crypts with lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrates. What is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is A. Ulcerative colitis.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms of ongoing diarrhea, blood in the stool, and lower abdominal pain are consistent with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
* The colonoscopy findings of patchy erythema and ulceration in multiple segments of the colon (cecum, ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon) suggest a chronic inflammatory process.
* The mucosal biopsy showing lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrates in colonic crypts is also consistent with IBD.
* The lack of recent travel history and no current medications make infectious colitis (option C) less likely.
* Pseudomembranous colitis (option D) is typically associated with a history of antibiotic use, which is not present in this case.
* Irritable bowel syndrome (option E) does not typically present with bloody stools and abdominal pain.
* Between ulcerative colitis (option A) and Crohn's disease (option B), the colonoscopy findings and biopsy results are more consistent with ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis typically affects the rectum and colon, with continuous inflammation starting from the rectum and extending proximally. The patchy erythema and ulceration in multiple segments of the colon, as described in the question, are more characteristic of ulcerative colitis.

According to the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines, the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis is based on a combination of clinical, endoscopic, and histological findings. The presence of rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, along with endoscopic evidence of inflammation and ulceration, and histological evidence of chronic inflammation and crypt distortion, support the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department after being stabbed 12 times in various parts of his body. Paramedics report extensive blood loss at the scene where he was found. Due to his Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, an endotracheal airway and large-bore access are secured prior to arrival. He is aggressively resuscitated with a massive transfusion protocol as the operating room is prepared for an exploratory laparotomy. An arterial line and central access are obtained. His temperature is 95°F (35°C), blood pressure is 50/40 mmHg, and pulse is 80/min, and respirations are controlled at 20/min on lung-protective volume control. After a 6:6:1 ratio of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets and the use of continuous phenylephrine infusion, the patient's vital signs remain the same. The surgical team reports no active blood loss. A stat ScvO2 results as 39% with a SaO2 of 100% on 100% oxygen. His extremities remain cold despite having the ambient room temperature increased to 80°F (26.7°C). What is the most likely cause of his presentation?",A,"The correct answer is B. Cervical spinal cord transection.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation is consistent with a severe spinal cord injury, specifically a cervical spinal cord transection. The key indicators are:

1. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3, which suggests a severe neurological deficit.
2. The patient's vital signs, particularly the blood pressure of 50/40 mmHg, indicate a lack of sympathetic tone, which is consistent with a cervical spinal cord injury.
3. The patient's pulse rate of 80/min is relatively slow, which is also consistent with a cervical spinal cord injury, as the sympathetic nervous system is responsible for increasing heart rate in response to stress.
4. The patient's extremities remain cold despite the ambient room temperature being increased, which suggests a lack of vasomotor tone, also consistent with a cervical spinal cord injury.
5. The ScvO2 (central venous oxygen saturation) of 39% is low, indicating inadequate tissue perfusion, which can be caused by a lack of sympathetic tone and vasopressor response.
6. The absence of active bleeding and the patient's stable vital signs despite aggressive resuscitation suggest that the patient's shock state is not due to ongoing hemorrhage.

While cardiac tamponade (A) could cause hypotension, it would not explain the patient's neurological deficits and lack of sympathetic tone. Occult hemorrhage (C) is possible, but the surgical team has reported no active bleeding, and the patient's vital signs are not improving despite aggressive resuscitation. Pulmonary embolism (D) is unlikely given the patient's presentation, and undiagnosed pneumonia (E) would not explain the patient's neurological deficits and hemodynamic instability.

In summary, the patient's presentation is most consistent with a cervical spinal cord transection, which is causing a lack of sympathetic tone, leading to hypotension, bradycardia, and inadequate tissue perfusion.",Success
"A 71-year-old woman presents to her physician accompanied by her son. She has no complaints, but her son states that the patient has impaired memory and poor orientation in space. She is ambulatory and is capable of self-care, but she tends to forget newly introduced information. Also, she got lost on the way from the home to the local market several times for the past 6 months, and her family is now afraid to let her go anywhere on her own. She does not have any concomitant chronic conditions nor did she have major cardiovascular events or head trauma. It is known that her father had dementia. The vital signs include: blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 62/min, respiratory rate is 11/min, and the temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F). The respiratory, cardiologic, and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. The neurological examination shows equal, round pupils with a normal reaction to light. The eye movements are normal with no nystagmus and normal oculocephalic reflex. There is no facial droop, the facial sensation is preserved, and there is no tongue deviation noted. There is no motor or sensory deficits on the upper and lower extremities. The patient scores 18 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Which of the following medications is indicated in the patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Donepezil.

The patient's symptoms, such as impaired memory, poor orientation in space, and difficulty learning new information, are consistent with Alzheimer's disease. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of 18 also supports this diagnosis, as a score of 18-25 indicates mild cognitive impairment.

Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor, which is a class of medications indicated for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. It works by increasing the levels of acetylcholine in the brain, a neurotransmitter involved in memory and cognitive function. Donepezil has been shown to improve cognitive function, daily living activities, and global functioning in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

The other options are not indicated for the patient's condition:

A. Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant, which may be used to treat depression, but it is not indicated for Alzheimer's disease.

B. Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which is used to treat depression, anxiety, and other conditions, but it is not specifically indicated for Alzheimer's disease.

C. Lithium is a mood stabilizer, which is used to treat conditions such as bipolar disorder, but it is not indicated for Alzheimer's disease.

E. Sulpiride is an antipsychotic medication, which is used to treat conditions such as schizophrenia, but it is not indicated for Alzheimer's disease.

It's worth noting that the patient's family history of dementia, specifically her father having dementia, may increase her risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. However, it is not a contraindication for any of the medications listed.",Success
"A 16-year-old teenager presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe pain in his right knee. He describes the pain as the worst pain he has ever felt. He denies any recent trauma or injury to the knee. The joint appears red and swollen and is hot to the touch. He denies any lower extremity numbness. There is no family history of joint or connective tissue disorders. The teenager is otherwise healthy. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 124/82 mm Hg, respirations are 17/min, pulse is 104/min, and temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F). On palpation of the affected joint, there is evidence of tenderness and capsular swelling; the joint is red and warm. Laboratory studies show increased serum CRP and procalcitonin levels. Which of the following will most likely found with analysis of his synovial fluid?",B,"The correct answer is B. WBC/mm3 53,000; % PMN > 75%; Viscosity low.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of septic arthritis, which is a medical emergency. The patient's joint appears red, swollen, and hot to the touch, and he has tenderness and capsular swelling on palpation. The laboratory studies show increased serum CRP and procalcitonin levels, which are indicative of an inflammatory response.

Analysis of the synovial fluid is crucial in diagnosing septic arthritis. In this case, the expected findings would be:

* A high white blood cell (WBC) count, typically above 50,000/mm³, indicating a significant inflammatory response.
* A high percentage of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), typically above 75%, which is characteristic of a bacterial infection.
* Low viscosity, indicating a non-viscous fluid, which is consistent with an inflammatory process.

Option B best matches these expected findings, making it the most likely result of the synovial fluid analysis.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. The WBC count is too low, and the percentage of PMNs is not high enough to suggest septic arthritis.

C. The WBC count is too low, and the percentage of PMNs is not high enough to suggest septic arthritis. Additionally, the viscosity is high, which is not consistent with an inflammatory process.

D. The WBC count is too low, and the percentage of PMNs is not high enough to suggest septic arthritis. Additionally, the viscosity is low, which is inconsistent with the other values.

E. The WBC count is high, but the percentage of PMNs is not high enough to suggest septic arthritis, and the viscosity is normal, which is not consistent with an inflammatory process.",Success

A peripheral blood smear reveals spherocytes. The Coombs test is negative. The physical examination is remarkable for scleral icterus and moderate splenomegaly. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic test of this patient’s underlying disorder?",A,"The correct answer is A. Eosin-5-maleimide binding test.

Here's why:

The patient's laboratory results and physical examination suggest anemia with spherocytosis, which is a hallmark of hereditary spherocytosis (HS). The presence of spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear, negative Coombs test, and splenomegaly are all consistent with this diagnosis.

The eosin-5-maleimide (EMA) binding test is a diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis. It is a flow cytometric test that detects the presence of abnormal red blood cell membranes, which is a characteristic feature of HS. The test is highly sensitive and specific for HS.

The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis:

B. Flow cytometry for CD55/CD59 is a test for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which is a different hematological disorder.

C. Anti-parvovirus B19 antibodies are used to diagnose parvovirus B19 infection, which can cause anemia, but it is not related to the patient's underlying disorder.

D. Bone marrow biopsy is not necessary for the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis, and it would not provide specific information about the red blood cell membrane defect.

E. Liver function tests may be abnormal due to the patient's underlying cholelithiasis, but they are not relevant to the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis.

In summary, the eosin-5-maleimide binding test is the most appropriate diagnostic test for this patient's underlying disorder, which is likely hereditary spherocytosis.",Success
"A 39-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of personality changes over the past year. He has become increasingly irritable, loud, aggressive, and impulsive. His wife also reports jerky movements of his limbs and trunk for the past few months. His father had dementia in his mid-40s, but the details of his condition are unclear. The patient appears restless. Examination shows irregular movements of the extremities and twitching of the face and tongue. Mental status examination shows impaired memory. This patient's condition is most likely associated with which of the following changes on MRI?",E,"The correct answer is E. Atrophy of the striatum.

The patient's symptoms, including personality changes, jerky movements, and impaired memory, are consistent with Huntington's disease, a rare genetic disorder caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat in the Huntingtin gene. Huntington's disease is characterized by progressive damage to the striatum, a region of the brain involved in movement, emotion, and cognition.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in patients with Huntington's disease typically shows atrophy of the striatum, particularly the caudate nucleus and putamen. This atrophy is often asymmetrical and can be seen even in the early stages of the disease.

The other options are not directly related to Huntington's disease:

A. Reduced hippocampal volume is more commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease.

B. Multiple cortical and subcortical infarctions are characteristic of vascular dementia.

C. Degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes is seen in frontotemporal dementia.

D. Extra-axial tumor with dural attachments is more likely to be a meningioma, a type of brain tumor.

It's worth noting that a definitive diagnosis of Huntington's disease requires genetic testing, and MRI findings are only supportive of the diagnosis.",Success
"A 45-year-old African-American woman comes to the physician after an episode of hemoptysis. Over the past 8 months, she has had a nonproductive cough, fatigue, and a 9-kg (20-lb) weight loss. She drinks a glass of wine every night and does not smoke. She has a history of hypertension and osteoarthritis. She does not take any medications. She has never traveled out of the country. She works as an accountant. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. Lungs are clear to auscultation. An x-ray of the chest shows a 2.5-cm nodule with irregular borders at the apex of the left lung with no mediastinal or hilar enlargement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is D. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as hemoptysis, nonproductive cough, fatigue, and weight loss, are consistent with lung cancer.
* The chest x-ray finding of a 2.5-cm nodule with irregular borders at the apex of the left lung is also suggestive of lung cancer.
* The patient's demographic characteristics, such as being an African-American woman, are more commonly associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
* Squamous cell carcinoma is more likely to occur in the upper lobes of the lung, which is consistent with the location of the nodule in this patient.
* The absence of mediastinal or hilar enlargement on the chest x-ray makes small cell lung cancer (option B) less likely, as it often presents with bulky mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
* Carcinoid tumor (option A) is a less common type of lung cancer and typically presents with symptoms related to hormone production, such as flushing and diarrhea, which are not mentioned in this patient's history.
* Sarcoidosis (option C) is a granulomatous disease that can cause lung nodules, but it is less likely to present with hemoptysis and weight loss, and the patient's history and radiographic findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.
* Adenocarcinoma of the lung (option E) is a common type of lung cancer, but it is more commonly associated with a peripheral lung nodule, and the patient's demographic characteristics make squamous cell carcinoma a more likely diagnosis.

According to the American Cancer Society, squamous cell carcinoma accounts for about 25-30% of all lung cancer cases, and it is more common in African-Americans than in other racial groups. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend that patients with suspected lung cancer undergo further evaluation, including computed tomography (CT) scans, positron emission tomography (PET) scans, and tissue sampling, to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of disease.",Success
"A 70-year-old man with hyperlipidemia and hypertension returns to his cardiologist for ongoing blood pressure management. He reports feeling fine with no trouble with his medications. He exercises regularly and sleeps well without snoring or daytime somnolence. His blood pressure measurements in the past have ranged from 160 - 170/80 - 100 mmHg. Today, his pressure is 150/100 mmHg with a pulse of 65/min while on hydrochlorothiazide and ramipril. Physical exam reveals a II/VI early systolic murmur with split S2 is appreciated at the right upper sternal border. There is unremarkable carotid, renal, or abdominal bruits. What is the most common cause of his hypertension?",C,"The correct answer is C. Stiffening of the aorta.

Justification:

The patient's blood pressure measurements have ranged from 160-170/80-100 mmHg, and today's reading is 150/100 mmHg. This suggests that the patient has a history of hypertension, particularly systolic hypertension. The physical exam reveals a II/VI early systolic murmur with split S2 at the right upper sternal border, which is consistent with aortic sclerosis or aortic stiffening.

Aortic stiffening is a common cause of isolated systolic hypertension in older adults, particularly those with a history of hypertension. As people age, the aorta becomes less compliant and stiffer, leading to increased systolic pressure and widened pulse pressure. This is supported by the patient's age (70 years old) and the presence of a systolic murmur.

The other options are less likely:

A. Primary hyperaldosteronism is a rare cause of hypertension, and there is no indication of it in this patient's presentation.

B. Hypothyroidism is not typically associated with hypertension, and there is no mention of thyroid function tests or symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism.

D. Obstructive sleep apnea is a common cause of hypertension, but the patient reports sleeping well without snoring or daytime somnolence, making this less likely.

E. Aortic stenosis is a possibility, but the murmur described is more consistent with aortic sclerosis or stiffening rather than aortic stenosis. Additionally, aortic stenosis would typically present with a louder, later-peaking murmur.

Therefore, based on the patient's age, physical exam findings, and medical history, stiffening of the aorta is the most likely cause of his hypertension.",Success
An 11-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. He is growing along with the 75th percentile and meeting all milestones. Physical examination shows a poorly rugated scrotum. The palpation of the scrotum shows only 1 testicle. A 2nd testicle is palpated in the inguinal canal. The examination of the penis shows a normal urethral meatus. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,E,"The correct answer is E. Orchiopexy.

The patient is an 11-month-old boy with a palpable testicle in the inguinal canal, which is indicative of an undescended testicle (cryptorchidism). The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends surgical correction, orchiopexy, for undescended testicles between 6-12 months of age. This is because the risk of testicular malignancy and infertility increases if the testicle is not descended into the scrotum by 1 year of age.

Option A, chorionic gonadotropin therapy, is not indicated in this case as it is used to stimulate testicular descent in some cases of undescended testicles, but it is not effective in cases where the testicle is palpable in the inguinal canal.

Option B, exploratory laparoscopy, may be necessary if the testicle is not palpable, but it is not the next step in management for a palpable testicle in the inguinal canal.

Option C, follow-up examination in 6 months, is not appropriate as the AAP recommends surgical correction within the first year of life.

Option D, orchiectomy, is not indicated in this case as the testicle is present and can be surgically descended into the scrotum.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is orchiopexy (Option E) to surgically correct the undescended testicle and reduce the risk of future complications.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician because of 1-day history of nausea and weakness. She has no history of serious illness.

Her temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows right costovertebral angle tenderness. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 14 g/dL
Leukocyte count 13,000/mm3
Platelet count 250,000/mm3
Serum
Urea nitrogen 18 mg/dL
Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL
Glucose 95 mg/dL
C-reactive protein 16.4 mg/L (N=0.08–3.1)
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",A,"The correct answer is A. Urinalysis.

The patient presents with a 1-day history of nausea and weakness, and physical examination reveals right costovertebral angle tenderness, which suggests a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's symptoms, along with the elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level, support this diagnosis. CRP is a marker of inflammation, and a level of 16.4 mg/L is significantly elevated, indicating an active inflammatory response.

Urinalysis is the most appropriate next step in management because it can help confirm the diagnosis of UTI by detecting the presence of leukocyte esterase, nitrites, or blood in the urine. Additionally, urinalysis can provide information about the severity of the infection and guide further management.

While the patient's sexual history and inconsistent condom use raise the possibility of a sexually transmitted infection (STI), the physical examination findings and laboratory results are more consistent with a UTI. A cervical swab (option B) may be indicated later in the evaluation, but it is not the most appropriate next step.

Abdominal ultrasound (option C) or CT scan of the abdomen (option E) may be necessary if the patient's symptoms worsen or if there is concern about a more serious underlying condition, such as a kidney stone or pyelonephritis. However, these imaging studies are not necessary at this point in the evaluation.

Blood culture (option D) is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient does not have signs of sepsis or a severe infection that would require blood cultures.

In summary, urinalysis is the most appropriate next step in management to confirm the diagnosis of UTI and guide further treatment.",Success
A 65-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine bone mineral density screening. She does not have any children. Menopause was at age 55. Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 48 years. She has hypertension for which she takes ramipril. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at the femoral neck shows a T-score of -2.7 SD. The physician considers treatment with raloxifene. This medication would put her at increased risk of developing which of the following conditions?,A,"The correct answer is A. Pulmonary embolism.

Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used to treat and prevent osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It is known to increase the risk of venous thromboembolic events, including pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. This is a black box warning for raloxifene, and patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of these conditions.

The other options are not correct because:

B. Cellulitis is a bacterial skin infection, and there is no association between raloxifene and an increased risk of cellulitis.

C. Raloxifene actually decreases the risk of breast cancer, particularly invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. It is sometimes used as a chemopreventive agent in high-risk women.

D. Mandibular osteonecrosis is a rare but serious complication of bisphosphonate therapy, not raloxifene.

E. Raloxifene does not affect cholesterol levels, so it does not increase the risk of hypercholesterolemia.

It's essential to weigh the benefits of raloxifene against the potential risks, especially in patients with a history of venous thromboembolic events or those at high risk of developing them.",Success
A multi-specialty physician practice is meeting to determine which compensation scheme would best serve the practice and its patient population. Which of the following are true in regards to physician compensation?,C,"The correct answers are C and E.

Let's break down each option:

A. Capitation poses the least financial risk to physicians: **INCORRECT**
Capitation actually poses a significant financial risk to physicians, as they receive a fixed payment per patient per unit of time (e.g., per month) regardless of the actual services provided. This means that if a patient requires more services or has complex needs, the physician may incur additional costs without corresponding reimbursement.

B. Fee-for-service pays physicians a set amount of money per unit time for every patient under their care: **INCORRECT**
Fee-for-service (FFS) compensation pays physicians a set amount of money for each specific service or procedure provided, not per unit time for every patient under their care. For example, a physician might receive $50 for a routine office visit, $100 for a surgical procedure, and so on.

C. Fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality: **CORRECT**
FFS compensation can create an incentive for physicians to provide more services, tests, or procedures, even if they may not be necessary or of high quality. This is because physicians are paid more for each additional service provided, which can lead to overutilization and increased healthcare costs.

D. Fee-for-service poses the most amount of financial risk to physicians: **INCORRECT**
While FFS compensation can create incentives for overutilization, it generally does not pose a significant financial risk to physicians, as they are paid for each service provided.

E. Capitation may provide perverse incentives to decrease preventive medicine visits: **CORRECT**
Capitation compensation can create an incentive for physicians to reduce or limit preventive medicine visits, as they receive a fixed payment per patient regardless of the services provided. This can lead to a focus on acute care rather than preventive care, potentially negatively impacting patient outcomes.

In summary, options C and E are correct, as FFS compensation can incentivize overutilization, and capitation compensation can create incentives to limit preventive care.",Success
"A 29-year-old woman presents to her primary care doctor for a prenatal visit. She has just learned that she is pregnant and estimates she is approximately 6 weeks pregnant given the timing of her last menstrual cycle. She has a history of recurrent fetal loss. In total, she has had 4 miscarriages between the gestational ages of 8 and 15 weeks. She has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and has had several DVTs in the past and a clot in her lung once. Her vitals today are unremarkable. She is asking if there are any treatments she should receive to prevent fetal loss. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Aspirin and heparin.

This patient has a history of recurrent fetal loss, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and thrombotic events (DVTs and pulmonary embolism). The combination of these factors suggests that she may have antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and a history of thrombotic events and recurrent pregnancy loss.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that women with APS and a history of thrombotic events receive antithrombotic therapy during pregnancy to prevent fetal loss and reduce the risk of maternal thrombotic events. The recommended regimen is aspirin (81 mg daily) and heparin (unfractionated or low-molecular-weight).

Aspirin helps to prevent platelet activation and thrombus formation, while heparin inhibits thrombin and prevents the formation of new clots. This combination has been shown to improve pregnancy outcomes in women with APS.

Option A, aspirin alone, is not sufficient, as it does not provide adequate thromboprophylaxis. Option C, aspirin and warfarin, is not recommended, as warfarin is teratogenic and should be avoided during pregnancy. Option D, no treatment indicated, is incorrect, as the patient's history suggests a high risk of fetal loss and thrombotic events. Option E, rivaroxaban, is not recommended for thromboprophylaxis during pregnancy, as it has not been studied in this population and may have adverse effects on the fetus.

In summary, the most appropriate management for this patient is aspirin and heparin therapy to prevent fetal loss and reduce the risk of maternal thrombotic events.",Success

Abdominal examination shows a firm, nontender left inguinal mass. Pelvic examination shows a blind vaginal pouch. Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is B. 5-α reductase deficiency.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of 5-α reductase deficiency, a rare genetic disorder that affects the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent form of testosterone. This deficiency leads to incomplete virilization of the external genitalia in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype.

The key findings that support this diagnosis are:

1. Normal breast development, indicating adequate estrogen production.
2. Scant axillary hair, suggesting reduced androgen activity.
3. A firm, nontender left inguinal mass, which is likely a testis.
4. A blind vaginal pouch, indicating abnormal Müllerian duct development.
5. The absence of a uterus and ovaries on ultrasonography, consistent with a 46,XY karyotype.

5-α reductase deficiency typically presents with ambiguous genitalia, but in this case, the patient's external genitalia are more feminized due to the lack of DHT. The presence of a testis in the inguinal canal and the absence of Müllerian duct structures (uterus and ovaries) support the diagnosis.

The other options are less likely:

A. Mullerian duct agenesis (Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome) typically presents with a normal 46,XX karyotype, normal breast development, and a normal vagina, but with agenesis of the uterus and upper part of the vagina.

C. Sex chromosome mosaicism is a possibility, but the presence of a testis and the absence of Müllerian duct structures make 5-α reductase deficiency a more likely diagnosis.

D. Sex chromosome monosomy (Turner syndrome) typically presents with short stature, ovarian dysgenesis, and a 45,X karyotype, which does not match this patient's presentation.

E. Androgen insensitivity syndrome typically presents with a 46,XY karyotype, but with a more complete feminization of the external genitalia, which is not seen in this patient.

In summary, the combination of physical examination findings, ultrasound results, and the patient's karyotype (not explicitly mentioned but implied to be 46,XY) support the diagnosis of 5-α reductase deficiency.",Success

Physical exam is notable only for pallor and general weakness. Laboratory studies reveal anemia as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) reveals a sharp, narrow spike of monoclonal IgM; serum IgM concentration is 6.3 g/dL. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?",C,"The correct answer is C. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, weight loss, and vision changes, are consistent with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow.
* The laboratory findings, including anemia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, support this diagnosis.
* The presence of a sharp, narrow spike of monoclonal IgM on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) is a hallmark of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. The high serum IgM concentration (6.3 g/dL) is also consistent with this diagnosis.
* Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia is a lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma that typically affects older adults and is characterized by the production of monoclonal IgM.
* Option A, IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), is a precursor condition that can progress to Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, but it is not the most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.
* Option B, multiple myeloma, is a possibility, but the presence of monoclonal IgM and the patient's symptoms make Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia more likely.
* Option D, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is a broad category that includes Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, but it is not a specific enough diagnosis.
* Option E, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, is not supported by the laboratory findings, particularly the presence of monoclonal IgM.

According to the International Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia Foundation, the diagnosis of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia is based on the presence of a monoclonal IgM protein in the blood or urine, along with symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and vision changes. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines also recommend considering Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia in patients with a monoclonal IgM protein and symptoms consistent with the disease.",Success
"A 73-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her daughter for evaluation of impaired memory and word-finding difficulties for 2 years.

She reports that she has become unable to taste or smell her food. Two years later, the patient dies. At autopsy, examination of the brain shows generalized cortical atrophy. A photomicrograph of a section of the brain is shown. The inclusions indicated by the arrows are predominantly composed of which of the following substances?",D,"The correct answer is D. Hyperphosphorylated tau.

The photomicrograph shows neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. NFTs are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, a microtubule-associated protein that becomes abnormally phosphorylated in Alzheimer's disease, leading to the formation of insoluble filaments that accumulate in neurons.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Alpha-synuclein is a protein associated with Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies, not Alzheimer's disease.

B. Viral ribonuclear proteins are not typically associated with Alzheimer's disease or the formation of NFTs.

C. Amyloid-β is a protein that accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, but it forms extracellular amyloid plaques, not NFTs.

E. Prion protein is associated with prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, not Alzheimer's disease.

Physical exam is notable for a patient with skin that appears yellow/orange. Cardiac, pulmonary, abdominal, and neurological exams are within normal limits. Which of the following is associated with this patient's underlying pathology?",C,"The correct answer is D. Increased consumption of beta-carotene.

The patient's skin appears yellow/orange, which is a classic sign of carotenemia, a harmless condition caused by excessive consumption of foods rich in beta-carotene, a precursor to vitamin A. Beta-carotene is found in high amounts in yellow and orange fruits and vegetables, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, and squash. When beta-carotene is ingested in large quantities, it can accumulate in the skin, causing a yellow or orange discoloration.

The laboratory results support this diagnosis, as the patient's bilirubin levels are elevated, with a total bilirubin of 11.3 mg/dL and a direct bilirubin of 7.8 mg/dL. This suggests that the patient's liver is functioning normally, and the elevated bilirubin is likely due to the breakdown of beta-carotene.

The other options are not associated with the patient's underlying pathology:

A. Sofosbuvir is a medication used to treat hepatitis C, which is not related to the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

B. Decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity is associated with Gilbert's syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects bilirubin metabolism. While the patient's bilirubin levels are elevated, the pattern of elevation is not consistent with Gilbert's syndrome.

C. Hyperpigmentation of the liver is not a characteristic of carotenemia.

E. Increased liver enzymes with AST > ALT is a pattern seen in liver damage or disease, which is not consistent with the patient's laboratory results or physical examination.",Success
"A 40-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe left upper quadrant pain (duration 3 hours, stabbing quality, 10/10 on the pain scale). Past medical history is significant for sickle cell anemia. Physical examination is significant for severe tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant. Significant splenomegaly is also noted. The patient is admitted to the hospital for close observation and placed on deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis as part of a routine protocol. Laboratory findings drawn sometime after admission demonstrate a normal prothrombin time (PT) and elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Which of the following factors is most directly affected by the DVT prophylaxis?",D,"The correct answer is C. VIIa.

The patient is on DVT prophylaxis, which typically involves the administration of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin. Heparin acts by activating antithrombin III, which in turn inactivates factor Xa and thrombin (IIa). The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is a laboratory test that measures the intrinsic and common coagulation pathways, and it is sensitive to the effects of heparin.

In this scenario, the patient's elevated PTT suggests that the DVT prophylaxis is affecting the coagulation cascade. Factor VIIa is not directly affected by heparin, as it is part of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, which is not affected by heparin.

Factor VII is also not directly affected, as it is part of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, which is not affected by heparin.

Factor XIIa is involved in the intrinsic coagulation pathway, but it is not directly affected by heparin. Heparin acts downstream of factor XIIa, inactivating thrombin and factor Xa.

Factor X is involved in the common coagulation pathway and is inactivated by antithrombin III, which is activated by heparin. However, the effect of heparin on factor X is indirect, through the activation of antithrombin III.

Factor XII is involved in the intrinsic coagulation pathway and is not directly affected by heparin.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. VIIa, as heparin can be used in conjunction with factor VIIa inhibitors, such as recombinant factor VIIa, to treat bleeding complications. However, in the context of DVT prophylaxis, heparin is not directly affecting factor VIIa.",Success
"A 47-year-old man with a history of HIV1 infection presents to his HIV clinic to discuss his antiretroviral medications. He is interested in including maraviroc in his maintenance regimen after seeing advertisements about the medication. On exam, his temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 116/74 mmHg, pulse is 64/min, and respirations are 12/min. His viral load is undetectable on his current regimen, and his blood count, electrolytes, and liver function tests have all been within normal limits. In order to consider maraviroc for therapy, a tropism assay needs to be performed. Which of the following receptors is affected by the use of maraviroc?",B,"The correct answer is B. gp120.

Maraviroc is a CCR5 antagonist, which means it blocks the CCR5 receptor on the surface of CD4 cells. HIV-1 uses the gp120 protein to bind to the CCR5 receptor, allowing the virus to enter the cell. By blocking the CCR5 receptor, maraviroc prevents the virus from entering the cell and replicating.

A tropism assay is necessary to determine whether the patient's HIV-1 strain uses the CCR5 receptor or the CXCR4 receptor to enter cells. Maraviroc is only effective against CCR5-tropic viruses, so the assay helps determine whether maraviroc would be an effective addition to the patient's regimen.

The other options are not correct because:

A. gp41 is a transmembrane protein involved in the fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell membrane, but it is not directly affected by maraviroc.

C. gp160 is a precursor protein that is cleaved to form gp120 and gp41, but it is not directly involved in the mechanism of action of maraviroc.

D. p24 is a viral capsid protein, not a receptor affected by maraviroc.

E. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme involved in the replication of HIV-1, but it is not a receptor affected by maraviroc.",Success
"A 16-year-old female presents to her physician’s office after noticing a round lump in her left breast 2 months ago. She reports that the lump seemed to enlarge and became tender just preceding her last 2 menses. It is otherwise painless, and the patient denies any discharge or skin changes. She has no past medical history but her grandmother, age 72, was just diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The patient is an avid softball player at her high school and denies alcohol, smoking, or illicit drug use. On exam, the breasts appear symmetric and normal. A 3-cm round, mobile mass is palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There is slight tenderness to deep palpation of the mass. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy on either side. Which of the following is the most likely outcome of this patient’s condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. This mass will most likely decrease in size or disappear over time.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a benign breast condition called fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas are common in young women, especially during adolescence and early adulthood. They are typically round, mobile, and painless, and may be tender to palpation, especially just before menstruation. The fact that the lump seems to have enlarged and become tender preceding the patient's last two menses suggests a hormonal influence, which is consistent with fibroadenoma.

Fibroadenomas are benign and usually do not increase the risk of breast cancer. In fact, studies have shown that women with fibroadenomas do not have an increased risk of breast cancer compared to the general population.

Option A is incorrect because while fibroadenomas may require excision if they are large or symptomatic, they often do not require surgical intervention.

Option B is incorrect because oral contraceptives are not typically used to treat fibroadenomas, and there is no evidence to suggest that they would decrease the size of the mass.

Option C is incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, fibroadenomas do not increase the risk of breast cancer.

Option E is incorrect because radiation and chemotherapy are not indicated for fibroadenomas, which are benign lesions. These treatments are typically reserved for malignant breast tumors.

In summary, the most likely outcome of this patient's condition is that the mass will decrease in size or disappear over time, as fibroadenomas often resolve spontaneously or decrease in size with time.",Success
"A 22-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a headache. She has had episodic headaches like this in the past and states that her headache today is severe, worse when laying down, and not responding to ibuprofen. She also reports a transient episode of vision loss and current blurry vision. She states she has a ringing in her ears as well. The patient has a past medical history of headaches, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and constipation. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 149/92 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is not remarkable and an initial head CT is within normal limits. Which of the following is the best next step in management for the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is D. MRI.

Based on the patient's symptoms, particularly the transient episode of vision loss, current blurry vision, and ringing in her ears, the most likely diagnosis is Pseudotumor Cerebri (PTC), also known as Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH). PTC is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without a tumor or other underlying cause.

The patient's history of obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and constipation are also consistent with PTC, as these conditions are common comorbidities.

The next best step in management would be to order an MRI to rule out other potential causes of increased intracranial pressure, such as a mass lesion or hydrocephalus. An MRI would also help to evaluate for signs of papilledema, which is a hallmark of PTC.

Option A, 100% oxygen, is not relevant to the management of PTC. Option B, ibuprofen, has already been tried and was ineffective. Option C, lumbar puncture, may be necessary to measure opening pressure and collect cerebrospinal fluid for analysis, but it is not the next best step in management. Option E, tissue plasminogen activator, is used to treat acute ischemic stroke, which is not suspected in this patient.

It's worth noting that the initial head CT was within normal limits, which is consistent with PTC, as it often does not show any abnormalities. However, an MRI is a more sensitive test and would provide more information to support the diagnosis.",Success
A 28-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of amenorrhea. Her last period occurred 4 months ago but she has not had sex in the last year and home pregnancy tests have come back negative. She first started having periods at age 13 and her periods have been unremarkable up until they stopped 4 months ago. Her past medical history is significant for radius and ulnar forearm fractures that she sustained in a car crash 3 months ago. She didn't see the car coming and has had increasing difficulty noticing objects in her peripheral vision. She also notes having recurrent headaches 5 months ago. Otherwise she has been healthy with no previous pregnancies. Physical exam reveals galactorrhea and temporal field visual defects. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for this patient's amenorrhea?,B,"The correct answer is B. Inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings point to a diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia, which is a condition characterized by elevated levels of prolactin in the blood. The galactorrhea (spontaneous milk production) and temporal field visual defects are classic signs of a prolactinoma, a type of pituitary tumor that produces excess prolactin.

The amenorrhea (cessation of menstruation) in this patient is likely due to the inhibitory effect of prolactin on GnRH release from the hypothalamus. GnRH is a hormone that stimulates the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland, which in turn regulate ovulation and menstruation. When prolactin levels are high, it can suppress GnRH release, leading to decreased FSH and LH production, and ultimately, amenorrhea.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings:

A. Excessive production of androgens would be more likely to cause hirsutism, acne, and virilization, rather than amenorrhea and galactorrhea.

C. Intrauterine scar tissue accumulation would not explain the patient's visual field defects, galactorrhea, or amenorrhea.

D. Nondisjunction of chromosomes is a genetic phenomenon that occurs during meiosis and is not related to the patient's symptoms.

E. Nutritional imbalance is unlikely to cause the specific combination of symptoms and physical exam findings seen in this patient.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of head trauma and recurrent headaches 5 months ago may be related to the development of the prolactinoma, as head trauma can cause pituitary tumors.",Success
"A 57-year-old homeless man is brought to the emergency department because of several episodes of hematemesis in the past 24 hours. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse of 95/min, and blood pressure of 85/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, he appears confused and unable to give a complete history. He is noted to have jaundice, palpable firm liver, mild splenomegaly, and shifting dullness consistent with the presence of ascites. Liver function tests are as follows:
Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  97 U/L
Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 40 U/L
Serum albumin 2.5 g/dL
Total bilirubin 3 mg/dL
Prothrombin time 20 seconds
Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's illness?",C,"The correct answer is C. Substance abuse.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation with hematemesis, jaundice, palpable firm liver, mild splenomegaly, and shifting dullness consistent with ascites suggests liver disease. The laboratory results also support this diagnosis, with elevated bilirubin and prothrombin time indicating liver dysfunction.

The AST:ALT ratio is also a key clue. In this case, the AST:ALT ratio is approximately 2.4 (97 U/L : 40 U/L), which is consistent with alcoholic liver disease. This ratio is often elevated in patients with chronic alcohol abuse due to the induction of microsomal enzymes that metabolize ethanol.

While the other options could potentially contribute to liver disease, they are less likely given the patient's presentation and laboratory results:

A. Metabolic disorder: The patient's liver function tests do not suggest a metabolic disorder such as Wilson's disease or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

B. Autoimmune liver disease: The patient's laboratory results do not support an autoimmune liver disease such as autoimmune hepatitis, which would typically present with elevated liver enzymes and autoantibodies.

D. Obesity: While obesity can contribute to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the patient's presentation with hematemesis and ascites is more consistent with cirrhosis, which is often associated with chronic alcohol abuse.

E. Hepatic venous outflow obstruction: This would typically present with Budd-Chiari syndrome, which is a rare condition characterized by hepatic vein thrombosis. The patient's presentation and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory results, the most likely cause of his illness is chronic alcohol abuse leading to cirrhosis.",Success
"A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department for a cough and fatigue. The patient was brought in from a nursing home with documentation stating that he has seemed confused for the past day according to the staff. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension. He is currently taking insulin, metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals crackles on pulmonary exam and S4 on cardiac auscultation. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",E,"The correct answer is D. Ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and admission to the intensive care unit.

Here's why:

The patient presents with a cough, fatigue, and confusion, which are concerning symptoms for pneumonia, particularly in an elderly patient from a nursing home. The physical exam findings of crackles on pulmonary exam and S4 on cardiac auscultation support this diagnosis. The patient's vital signs, including a fever and tachycardia, also suggest a severe infection.

Given the patient's age, comorbidities, and severity of symptoms, hospital admission is necessary. The patient requires close monitoring and potentially intensive care, which is why admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is the best option.

In terms of antibiotic therapy, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend empiric treatment with a beta-lactam (such as ceftriaxone) plus a macrolide (such as azithromycin) for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in patients who require ICU admission. This combination provides coverage for both typical and atypical pathogens.

Option A is incorrect because azithromycin alone may not provide adequate coverage for typical bacterial pathogens, and admission to the medical floor may not provide the necessary level of care for a patient who requires ICU admission.

Option B is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest a severe infection that requires hospital admission and more aggressive treatment.

Option C is incorrect because moxifloxacin is not recommended as a first-line agent for CAP in the IDSA guidelines, and the patient may require additional coverage for typical bacterial pathogens.

Option E is incorrect because moxifloxacin alone may not provide adequate coverage for typical bacterial pathogens, and admission to the medical floor may not provide the necessary level of care for a patient who requires ICU admission.",Success
"A 72-year-old man in a nursing home was brought to the emergency department with right hand and leg weakness for 1 hour. There has been a gradual increase in the degree of weakness. The patient is disoriented. The medical history includes ischemic heart disease diagnosed 2 months ago, and long histories of diabetes and hypertension (30 and 25 years, respectively). On examination, the reflexes are hypertonic and the Babinski reflex is positive. The CT scan is shown. What is the most likely pathologic change?",B,"The correct answer is B. Liquefactive necrosis.

The patient's symptoms, including right hand and leg weakness, disorientation, and a positive Babinski reflex, suggest a diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke. The CT scan likely shows a large middle cerebral artery infarction, which is consistent with this diagnosis.

Liquefactive necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in response to ischemic injury, particularly in the brain. It is characterized by the breakdown of tissue into a liquid state, often with the formation of a cystic cavity. This type of necrosis is commonly seen in cerebral infarctions, such as in this patient.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings:

A. Gangrenous necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in response to ischemia, often in the context of peripheral vascular disease. While the patient has a history of ischemic heart disease, the symptoms and CT scan findings are more consistent with a cerebral infarction.

C. Caseous necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in response to infection, particularly tuberculosis. There is no indication of infection in this patient's presentation.

D. Fibrinoid necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in response to immune-mediated injury, often in the context of vasculitis. There is no indication of vasculitis in this patient's presentation.

E. Coagulative necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in response to ischemia, often in the context of solid organ infarction (e.g., myocardial infarction). While the patient has a history of ischemic heart disease, the symptoms and CT scan findings are more consistent with a cerebral infarction.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are consistent with a diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke, and the most likely pathologic change is liquefactive necrosis.",Success
"An 11-year-old boy was brought in by his mother with red tender bumps on his legs. The patient’s mother says that his symptoms started 3 days ago with a low-grade fever, malaise, and joint pain. He began to improve over the next 2 days, but this morning, when he woke up, she noticed multiple painful red bumps on his shins. Past medical history is significant for a recent severe sore throat and fever 1 week ago which resolved without treatment. The vital signs include: temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F), blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg, pulse 85/min, and respiratory rate 15/min. Physical examination reveals multiple, firm and tender erythematous nodules with indistinct borders, averaging 4 cm in diameter. Lesions are localized to the anterior surface of the lower legs. No evidence of drainage, bleeding, abscess formation or ulceration. Which of the following is the next best diagnostic step in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Throat culture.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with erythema nodosum (EN), a type of panniculitis that typically presents with painful, erythematous nodules on the shins. EN is often associated with underlying infections, such as streptococcal pharyngitis.

Given the patient's recent history of severe sore throat and fever, which resolved without treatment, it is likely that the EN is a post-infectious complication of the streptococcal infection. A throat culture would help confirm the presence of Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) and establish a link between the recent pharyngitis and the development of EN.

The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis of EN or the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms:

B. Chest radiograph: While EN can be associated with underlying conditions such as sarcoidosis or tuberculosis, which may involve the lungs, a chest radiograph is not the next best diagnostic step in this patient.

C. p-ANCA serology: p-ANCA (perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) is a laboratory test used to diagnose certain autoimmune disorders, such as vasculitis. While EN can be associated with autoimmune disorders, p-ANCA serology is not a relevant test in this patient.

D. Bone marrow biopsy: Bone marrow biopsy is not indicated in the diagnosis of EN or the evaluation of the patient's symptoms.

E. Colonoscopy: Colonoscopy is not related to the diagnosis of EN or the patient's symptoms, and it is not a relevant diagnostic test in this case.

In summary, a throat culture is the next best diagnostic step to confirm the presence of GABHS and establish a link between the recent pharyngitis and the development of EN.",Success

Her pregnancy was uncomplicated with the exception of a positive vaginal swab for group B streptococci 3 weeks ago, for which she received one dose of intravenous penicillin. Her temperature is 37.6°C (99.8°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 70/30 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 82%. Physical examination shows labored breathing and thready pulses. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. The abdomen is nontender. Speculum examination shows pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 7.6 mg/dL and an undetectable fibrinogen concentration. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s current condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins.

This patient's sudden onset of symptoms, including chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension, is consistent with an anaphylactoid syndrome of pregnancy, also known as amniotic fluid embolism (AFE). The presence of bright red blood in the cervical canal, labored breathing, and crackles at both lung bases support this diagnosis.

AFE is a rare but life-threatening condition that occurs when amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation, typically through the endocervical veins, causing a severe allergic-like reaction. This can lead to cardiovascular collapse, respiratory distress, and coagulopathy, as seen in this patient.

The other options are less likely:

A. Apical ballooning of the left ventricle (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) is a condition that can cause cardiovascular symptoms, but it is not typically associated with respiratory distress, coagulopathy, or the presence of blood in the cervical canal.

B. Allergic reaction to anesthetic agent is possible, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with AFE, and there is no history of allergy to the anesthetic agent.

D. Anesthetic agent entering the subarachnoid space could cause respiratory depression, but it would not explain the patient's cardiovascular symptoms, coagulopathy, or the presence of blood in the cervical canal.

E. Systemic bacterial infection is unlikely given the patient's recent treatment with antibiotics for group B streptococci and the lack of fever or other signs of infection.

A bone marrow aspiration is ordered but after multiple attempts, they are unable to obtain an adequate bone marrow sample. A peripheral blood smear would likely reveal cells that stain with which of the following stains?",D,"The correct answer is D. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase.

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is hairy cell leukemia. The patient's fatigue, mild splenomegaly, and pancytopenia (anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia) are consistent with this diagnosis. The inability to obtain an adequate bone marrow sample is also suggestive of hairy cell leukemia, as the bone marrow is often fibrotic and difficult to aspirate in this condition.

Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) is a specific stain used to diagnose hairy cell leukemia. It is a sensitive and specific marker for hairy cell leukemia, and a positive TRAP stain is often considered diagnostic of this condition.

The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia:

A. Prussian Blue is a stain used to detect iron in tissues and is not specific to hairy cell leukemia.

B. Ziehl-Neelsen is a stain used to detect acid-fast bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and is not relevant to this diagnosis.

C. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) is a stain used to detect glycogen and other carbohydrates in tissues, and while it may be used in the evaluation of certain hematologic disorders, it is not specific to hairy cell leukemia.

E. Giemsa is a general-purpose stain used to evaluate blood smears, but it is not a specific stain for hairy cell leukemia.

"While on a teaching sabbatical in Uruguay, a pathologist examined the excised liver of an 18-year-old otherwise healthy female who passed away due to massive hepatic necrosis 5 days after she underwent general anesthesia to repair a fractured femur. Which of the following is a general anesthetic most likely responsible for her death?",D,"The correct answer is D. Halothane.

Halothane is a volatile anesthetic that has been associated with a rare but potentially fatal complication called halothane-induced hepatitis or halothane-induced liver damage. This condition is characterized by massive hepatic necrosis, which is consistent with the patient's presentation.

Halothane-induced hepatitis is thought to be an immune-mediated reaction, and it typically occurs in individuals who have previously been exposed to halothane. The risk of developing this complication is estimated to be around 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 30,000.

The other options are not typically associated with massive hepatic necrosis:

A. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic, not a general anesthetic, and it is not typically associated with liver damage.

B. Lidocaine is also a local anesthetic, and while it can cause systemic toxicity, it is not typically associated with liver damage.

C. Midazolam is a benzodiazepine that is often used as a sedative or anesthetic, but it is not typically associated with liver damage.

E. Desflurane is a volatile anesthetic, but it is not typically associated with liver damage.

"A 45-year-old woman with hypothyroidism comes to the physician because of progressive fatigue, lethargy, and epigastric pain after eating. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae. Laboratory studies show decreased serum hemoglobin levels and increased serum gastrin levels. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy shows inflammation of the gastric body and fundus. A photomicrograph of a biopsy specimen taken from the gastric antrum is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",C,"The correct answer is C. Parietal cell destruction.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, lethargy, and epigastric pain after eating, are consistent with gastritis and anemia. The physical examination finding of pale conjunctivae suggests anemia. The laboratory results show decreased serum hemoglobin levels, indicating anemia, and increased serum gastrin levels, which can be seen in conditions that affect the stomach, such as gastritis or atrophic gastritis.

The photomicrograph of the biopsy specimen taken from the gastric antrum likely shows atrophic gastritis, which is characterized by the destruction of parietal cells. Parietal cells are responsible for producing intrinsic factor, which is necessary for vitamin B12 absorption. The destruction of parietal cells can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency, resulting in anemia.

Option C, Parietal cell destruction, is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms. Atrophic gastritis, which is characterized by parietal cell destruction, can lead to vitamin B12 deficiency, anemia, and gastritis, consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Mucosal cell hyperplasia is not a common cause of anemia and gastritis.

B. Enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia is associated with hypergastrinemia, but it is not typically associated with anemia and gastritis.

D. Chief cell destruction would affect pepsin production, but it is not typically associated with anemia and gastritis.

E. I cell destruction would affect cholecystokinin production, but it is not typically associated with anemia and gastritis.

A 72-year-old anthropologist with long-standing hypertension visits your office for a routine exam. You notice an abnormality on his laboratory results caused by his regimen of captopril and triamterene. What abnormality did you most likely find?,B,"The correct answer is B. Hyperkalemia.

Here's why:

Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which is a type of medication used to treat hypertension. One of the potential side effects of ACE inhibitors is hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels). This is because ACE inhibitors can increase the levels of aldosterone, a hormone that helps regulate potassium levels in the body.

Triamterene, on the other hand, is a potassium-sparing diuretic. This type of diuretic can also contribute to hyperkalemia, as it reduces the excretion of potassium in the urine.

Given the combination of captopril and triamterene, it is likely that the abnormality found on the laboratory results is hyperkalemia.

The other options are not directly related to the medications mentioned:

A. Hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels) is not typically associated with ACE inhibitors or potassium-sparing diuretics.

C. Hypernatremia (elevated sodium levels) is also not directly related to these medications.

D. Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is not a known side effect of captopril or triamterene.

E. Anemia (low red blood cell count) is not directly related to these medications either.

Therefore, based on the medications and their potential side effects, the most likely abnormality found on the laboratory results is hyperkalemia.",Success
"A 56-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband because of increasing confusion, generalized fatigue, and irritability for the past week. She has been unable to recall her husband's name or their address. She has had insomnia and daytime sleepiness during this period. Her last bowel movement was 3 days ago. One month ago, she underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portal shunt (TIPS) placement. She has alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Current medications include spironolactone and furosemide.

Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. There are several telangiectasias over the chest and back. Palmar erythema is present. The abdomen is mildly distended and nontender. Shifting dullness is present. There is a flapping tremor of both hands when outstretched and dorsiflexed. Neurologic examination shows no other focal findings. She completes the number connection test slower than the age-normalized standard. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Administer lactulose.

The patient's symptoms, including increasing confusion, generalized fatigue, irritability, insomnia, and daytime sleepiness, are consistent with hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a common complication of liver cirrhosis. The flapping tremor of both hands, also known as asterixis, is a characteristic physical finding in HE. The number connection test result, which shows slower completion than the age-normalized standard, further supports the diagnosis of HE.

Lactulose is a medication that helps reduce the production and absorption of ammonia in the gut, which is a key contributor to the development of HE. It is a first-line treatment for HE and is recommended by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL).

Reversal of TIPS (Option A) may not be necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with HE than with TIPS-related complications.

Paracentesis (Option B) may be necessary to manage ascites, but it is not the most appropriate next step in managing the patient's HE.

Ceftriaxone (Option C) is an antibiotic that may be used to treat infections, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which can precipitate HE. However, there is no evidence of infection in this patient, and ceftriaxone is not a treatment for HE.

Vitamin B1 (Option E) is important for patients with liver disease, particularly those with a history of alcoholism. However, it is not a treatment for HE, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy, a condition that may be caused by thiamine deficiency.",Success
"A 50-year-old woman is brought to the office by her daughter with a chief complaint of finger pain in her left hand. She is slightly confused and can’t remember when the pain started. Her daughter states that the pain has been present for approximately one month. She expresses concern that her mother has been progressively more confused during the past week. She reports that her mother also has had worsening nausea for several months. The patient’s vital signs are heart rate 92/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), and blood pressure 120/86 mm Hg. Upon physical examination, the patient reports pain when the fingers of the left hand are palpated, and small palpable tumors are visible on the fingers. An X-ray image of the left-hand shows thin bones with brown tumors and osteolysis of the distal phalanges. What is the most likely cause for this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Hyperparathyroidism.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with hyperparathyroidism, a condition characterized by excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The key features that support this diagnosis are:

1. Finger pain: The patient's complaint of finger pain, especially with palpation, is consistent with bone resorption and osteolysis, which are common features of hyperparathyroidism.
2. Palpable tumors on the fingers: The presence of small palpable tumors on the fingers, also known as brown tumors, is a characteristic feature of hyperparathyroidism. These tumors are composed of fibrous tissue and osteoclasts, which are stimulated by excessive PTH production.
3. X-ray findings: The X-ray image showing thin bones, brown tumors, and osteolysis of the distal phalanges is consistent with the radiographic features of hyperparathyroidism.
4. Confusion and nausea: The patient's confusion and nausea can be attributed to hypercalcemia, which is a common complication of hyperparathyroidism. Hypercalcemia can cause neurological symptoms such as confusion, lethargy, and nausea.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

B. Hypocalcemia is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms and X-ray findings are consistent with hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia.

C. Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer, but it typically presents with a more aggressive course and different radiographic features than what is described in this case.

D. Multiple myeloma is a hematological malignancy that can cause bone lesions, but it is less likely to cause the specific combination of symptoms and radiographic features seen in this case.

E. Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by bone loss and fragility, but it does not typically cause the specific symptoms and radiographic features seen in this case, such as brown tumors and osteolysis.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with hyperparathyroidism, making it the most likely cause of her condition.",Success
"A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of lightheadedness, intermittent headaches, and easy bruising. Five months ago, she was treated for an episode of thrombophlebitis. Physical examination shows multiple bruises on her limbs. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 900,000/mm3 and elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid. Treatment with a medication is begun that is also used in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the beneficial effect of this drug in sickle cell disease?",B,"The correct answer is B. Increase in circulating fetal hemoglobin.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia, a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an overproduction of platelets. The medication used to treat this condition is likely hydroxyurea, which is also used to treat sickle cell disease.

In sickle cell disease, hydroxyurea increases the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which can help to reduce the severity of the disease. HbF is a type of hemoglobin that is present in high concentrations in fetal life but decreases significantly after birth. In individuals with sickle cell disease, HbF can help to inhibit the polymerization of sickle hemoglobin, reducing the sickling of red blood cells and alleviating symptoms.

The other options are not correct:

A. Inhibition of thrombocyte aggregation: While hydroxyurea may have some antiplatelet effects, this is not its primary mechanism of action in sickle cell disease.

C. Substitution of cofactors for DNA synthesis: Hydroxyurea is not involved in DNA synthesis or the provision of cofactors.

D. Inhibition of stem cell differentiation: Hydroxyurea does not inhibit stem cell differentiation.

E. Restoration of the body's iron stores: Hydroxyurea is not involved in iron metabolism or storage.

It's worth noting that hydroxyurea is used to treat other conditions as well, including polycythemia vera and myeloid leukemia, but its mechanism of action in these conditions is different from its effect in sickle cell disease.",Success
"Candida is injected into the skin of a 38-year-old female patient. Forty-eight hours later, there is a 14 mm raised, slightly hardened area at the injection site. What type of hypersensitivity reaction has occurred and what cell type plays a role?",D,"The correct answer is D. Type IV hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells.

Here's why:

The scenario described is a classic example of a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, which is a type of cell-mediated immune response. The fact that the reaction occurs 48 hours after the injection of Candida antigen and presents as a raised, hardened area at the injection site is consistent with a DTH response.

Type IV hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by T cells, specifically CD4+ T cells, which play a central role in this type of response. CD4+ T cells recognize and respond to antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells, leading to the activation of immune cells and the production of cytokines that cause inflammation and tissue damage.

The other options are not correct:

A. Type I hypersensitivity reactions are immediate-type reactions, typically occurring within minutes to hours after exposure to an allergen, and are mediated by IgE antibodies and mast cells. Eosinophils may also be involved, but this is not the primary cell type responsible for the reaction.

B. Mast cells are involved in type I hypersensitivity reactions, not type IV.

C. Type III hypersensitivity reactions involve the formation of immune complexes and are typically associated with conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus. CD4+ T cells are not the primary cell type involved in this type of reaction.

E. Macrophages are involved in the processing and presentation of antigens to T cells, but they are not the primary cell type responsible for the reaction in this scenario.

It's worth noting that the Candida skin test is a diagnostic tool used to assess cell-mediated immunity, and a positive reaction (induration ≥ 5 mm) indicates that the individual has been previously exposed to Candida and has mounted an immune response.",Success
"On routine screening, a 62-year-old man is found to have positive fecal occult blood tests. He is asymptomatic, but his father died of large intestinal cancer. Abdominal and rectal exams are normal. A colonoscopy subsequently reveals a polyp in the descending colon but no other abnormalities. Excisional biopsy of the polyp shows 75% tubular architecture. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Adenomatous polyp.

Here's why:

* The patient's positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT) suggests the presence of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, which is a common symptom of colorectal cancer or polyps.
* The colonoscopy reveals a polyp in the descending colon, which is a common location for adenomatous polyps.
* The excisional biopsy showing 75% tubular architecture is consistent with an adenomatous polyp. Adenomatous polyps are characterized by a tubular or villous architecture, and the presence of dysplastic epithelial cells. The percentage of tubular architecture can vary, but 75% is within the range expected for an adenomatous polyp.
* Inflammatory polyps (Option A) are typically associated with inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, and are not typically seen in asymptomatic individuals.
* Hamartomatous polyps (Option C) are benign growths that are typically seen in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. They are not typically associated with a family history of colorectal cancer.
* Colorectal cancer (Option D) is a possibility, but the biopsy results suggest a polyp rather than invasive cancer.
* Hemorrhoids (Option E) are not typically associated with a positive FOBT or a polyp on colonoscopy.

According to the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) and the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), adenomatous polyps are the most common type of polyp found in the colon and are considered precursors to colorectal cancer.",Success
"A 20-year-old male college student presents to the emergency room at 4 AM in the morning with complaints of abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for the past 2 hours. He was studying for his exams last night when he became hungry and ate some food from the afternoon after heating it for a while. He says that his symptoms began an hour after he ate the food. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 90/78 mm Hg. A physical examination is within normal limits except for signs of dehydration. What is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Bacillus cereus infection.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are consistent with a gastrointestinal infection.
* The short incubation period of 1 hour after eating the reheated food suggests a preformed toxin-mediated illness, which is characteristic of Bacillus cereus infection.
* Bacillus cereus is a common cause of food poisoning, particularly associated with reheated rice, pasta, and other starchy foods. The patient's history of eating reheated food from the afternoon supports this diagnosis.
* The patient's physical examination is within normal limits except for signs of dehydration, which is consistent with a mild to moderate gastrointestinal infection.
* The other options are less likely:
	+ Cryptosporidiosis (A) typically causes a more chronic and watery diarrhea, and the incubation period is usually longer than 1 hour.
	+ C. difficile colitis (B) is typically associated with antibiotic use and causes a more severe illness, often with bloody stools.
	+ Norovirus infection (D) is a common cause of gastroenteritis, but the incubation period is usually 12-48 hours, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a toxin-mediated illness.
	+ Rotavirus infection (E) is typically seen in children under 5 years old, and the incubation period is usually 1-3 days.

"A 79-year-old woman presents to her physician complaining of a persistent non-productive cough and dyspnea after contracting a cold in the past month. She describes herself as being “generally healthy” before the cold started. Medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient takes hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. Her parents are both deceased. She does not smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. During a review of symptoms, she described a month-long trip to St. Louis, Missouri, to visit family. At the physician’s office, her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. A focused chest exam reveals mild crepitus on the right side. A chest X-ray shows a cavitary lesion in the right lung which is confirmed on chest computed tomography (CT). A lung biopsy is performed to rule out cancer and reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with oval yeast in macrophages. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Histoplasmosis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as a persistent non-productive cough and dyspnea, are consistent with a respiratory infection. The presence of a cavitary lesion in the right lung on chest X-ray and CT scan suggests a granulomatous disease. The lung biopsy results, which show necrotic granulomatous inflammation with oval yeast in macrophages, are characteristic of fungal infections.

Given the patient's travel history to St. Louis, Missouri, and the presence of oval yeast in macrophages, Histoplasmosis is the most likely diagnosis. Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, which is commonly found in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, including Missouri. The fungus is typically acquired through inhalation of spores from contaminated soil or bird droppings.

Coccidioidomycosis (Option A) is a fungal infection that is typically found in the southwestern United States, and the patient's travel history does not suggest exposure to this region.

Blastomycosis (Option B) is a fungal infection that can cause similar symptoms, but it is more commonly associated with skin lesions and is not typically found in the Midwest region of the United States.

Sporotrichosis (Option C) is a fungal infection that typically affects the skin and is not typically associated with pulmonary symptoms.

Onychomycosis (Option E) is a fungal infection of the nails and is not related to the patient's symptoms or lung biopsy results.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, travel history, and lung biopsy results, Histoplasmosis is the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 14-year-old girl comes to the physician because she has not yet had her period. She is at the 10th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. Examination shows a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, a low posterior hairline, forearms angled 20° away from the body when fully extended, and shortened fourth metacarpals bilaterally. Sexual development is Tanner stage 1. Which of the following statements about this patient's fertility is most accurate?",A,"The correct answer is A. Pregnancy success rate with donor oocytes is similar to patients with primary ovarian failure.

The patient's physical examination findings, including a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, a low posterior hairline, forearms angled away from the body, and shortened fourth metacarpals, are consistent with Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females, characterized by a 45,X karyotype or a variant of it, and is the most common cause of primary amenorrhea.

Women with Turner syndrome often have primary ovarian failure, which means their ovaries do not function properly, leading to infertility. However, with assisted reproductive technology (ART), specifically oocyte donation, women with Turner syndrome can achieve pregnancy. The success rate of pregnancy with donor oocytes is similar to that of patients with primary ovarian failure.

Option B is incorrect because administration of gonadotropins will not increase the chances of conceiving in a patient with Turner syndrome, as their ovaries are not responsive to hormonal stimulation.

Option C is not relevant to Turner syndrome, as impaired tubal ciliary function is not a characteristic of this condition.

Option D is incorrect because the majority of patients with Turner syndrome will not become pregnant without medical assistance due to their ovarian failure.

Option E is also incorrect, as women with Turner syndrome do have a uterus, but their ovaries are non-functional, making surrogacy unnecessary.",Success
"An investigator is studying traumatic knee joint injuries in college athletes. Images and tissue samples are collected from 4 athletes with cartilaginous injury and 4 athletes with bone fractures. After 8 weeks, the athletes with bone fractures show almost complete resolution, while the athletes with cartilaginous injuries show only minimal signs of healing. The investigator hypothesizes that this is due to the absence of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration. Transplant of which of the following tissues would most likely promote healing in the group with cartilaginous injury?",A,"The correct answer is A. Perichondrium.

Here's why:

The investigator's hypothesis is that the lack of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration is responsible for the poor healing of cartilaginous injuries. Perichondrium is a layer of tissue that surrounds cartilage and contains mesenchymal stem cells, which are progenitor cells capable of differentiating into chondrocytes and promoting cartilage regeneration.

Transplanting perichondrium tissue would provide a source of these progenitor cells, which could differentiate into chondrocytes and promote matrix regeneration, ultimately enhancing healing in the athletes with cartilaginous injuries.

The other options are not correct because:

B. Proteoglycans are a type of molecule found in cartilage, but they are not a source of progenitor cells.

C. Chondronectin is a protein involved in cartilage development and maintenance, but it is not a tissue that can be transplanted to promote healing.

D. Osteoblasts are cells responsible for bone formation, not cartilage regeneration.

E. Mature chondrocytes are the cells that make up cartilage, but transplanting them would not provide the necessary progenitor cells for matrix regeneration. Additionally, mature chondrocytes may not be able to adapt to the new environment and may not be able to promote significant healing.

This answer is supported by current medical guidelines and research, which highlight the importance of progenitor cells in tissue engineering and regeneration.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of increasing weakness and numbness of the upper extremities for 5 days. During the past 2 days, she has had urinary incontinence not related to sneezing or laughing. Last summer, she had weakness and numbness of her right lower extremity that was worse when she was outside; she regained her strength 3 weeks later. She has no history of serious illness. She has had 10 male sexual partners in her lifetime and uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows an impaired tandem gait. There is mild spasticity and muscle strength is decreased in both upper extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ bilaterally. The abdominal reflex is absent. Muscle strength in the right lower extremity is mildly decreased. Sensation to vibration and fine touch is decreased over the upper extremities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. MRI of the brain and spine.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a demyelinating disorder, specifically multiple sclerosis (MS). The symptoms of weakness and numbness in the upper extremities, urinary incontinence, and impaired tandem gait are consistent with a central nervous system (CNS) disorder. The patient's history of a previous episode of weakness and numbness in the right lower extremity that resolved on its own also supports this diagnosis.

An MRI of the brain and spine is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis because it can help identify lesions in the CNS that are characteristic of MS. MRI is a sensitive and specific test for detecting demyelinating lesions in the CNS and can help confirm the diagnosis of MS.

Option A, antinuclear antibody testing, is not relevant to this patient's symptoms and is typically used to diagnose autoimmune disorders such as lupus.

Option B, muscle biopsy, is not necessary in this case because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a CNS disorder rather than a peripheral nerve or muscle disorder.

Option C, rapid plasma reagin test, is used to diagnose syphilis, which is not suspected based on the patient's symptoms and history.

Option E, lumbar puncture, may be necessary later in the diagnostic workup to evaluate for oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid, which are often present in MS. However, an MRI of the brain and spine should be performed first to identify any lesions in the CNS.

It's worth noting that the patient's inconsistent use of condoms and history of multiple sexual partners may suggest a risk for sexually transmitted infections, but this is not the primary focus of the patient's current symptoms and diagnosis.",Success
"A 37-year-old woman presents to your office with heartburn. Following an extensive workup, you diagnose her with a duodenal ulcer secondary to H. pylori infection. You prescribe triple therapy of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of omeprazole?",D,"The correct answer is D. Inhibition of primary active transport.

Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), which works by inhibiting the primary active transport of hydrogen ions (H+) from the parietal cells of the stomach into the gastric lumen. This reduces the production of gastric acid, thereby decreasing the acidity of the stomach contents and alleviating symptoms of heartburn and duodenal ulcers.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. SST2 receptor agonist: Omeprazole is not an SST2 receptor agonist. SST2 receptors are involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion, but omeprazole does not act on these receptors.

B. Parasympathetic inhibition: Omeprazole does not inhibit parasympathetic activity. The parasympathetic nervous system stimulates gastric acid secretion, but omeprazole's mechanism of action is independent of this pathway.

C. Reversible block of H2 receptors: This option is incorrect because omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor, not an H2 receptor antagonist. H2 receptor antagonists, such as ranitidine, work by blocking the action of histamine on parietal cells, whereas omeprazole inhibits the proton pump itself.

E. Inhibition of 50S ribosomal subunit: This option is incorrect because omeprazole does not inhibit the 50S ribosomal subunit. This mechanism of action is associated with macrolide antibiotics, such as clarithromycin, which is also part of the triple therapy regimen. Clarithromycin inhibits protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit, whereas omeprazole has a distinct mechanism of action as a proton pump inhibitor.",Success

Physical examination shows a bluish plaque with a central area of necrosis surrounded by a rim of erythema at the dorsum of the right hand. Which of the following animals is most likely responsible for the patient's symptoms?",C,"The correct answer is C. Brown recluse spider.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as the wound being initially painless, followed by reddening, blistering, and eventually turning blue with a blackish discoloration at the center, are consistent with a brown recluse spider bite.
* The physical examination finding of a bluish plaque with a central area of necrosis surrounded by a rim of erythema is also characteristic of a brown recluse spider bite.
* Brown recluse spiders are found in the southern and midwestern United States, including Texas, which is where the patient was camping.
* The other options are less likely:
	+ Bald-faced hornet (A) stings can cause pain, swelling, and redness, but they do not typically cause necrotic lesions.
	+ Diamondback rattlesnake (B) bites can cause severe pain, swelling, and bruising, but they do not typically cause bluish discoloration or necrosis.
	+ Striped bark scorpion (D) stings can cause severe pain, numbness, and tingling, but they do not typically cause skin lesions or necrosis.
	+ Deer tick (E) bites can cause a characteristic ""bull's-eye"" rash, but they do not typically cause necrotic lesions or bluish discoloration.

"Two weeks after starting chemotherapy with etoposide, a 66-year-old man with small cell lung cancer comes to the physician because of persistent nausea and vomiting. His symptoms improve significantly after the administration of metoclopramide. This patient's symptoms were most likely due to the effect of chemotherapy on which of the following structures?",E,"The correct answer is E. Area postrema.

Explanation:

Etoposide, a chemotherapeutic agent, can cause nausea and vomiting as a side effect. The area postrema, also known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), is a small region in the brain that is responsible for detecting toxins and triggering the vomiting reflex. The CTZ is located outside the blood-brain barrier, making it accessible to chemotherapy agents like etoposide.

The CTZ contains receptors that are sensitive to chemicals, including chemotherapy drugs. When these receptors are stimulated, they send signals to the vomiting center in the brain, leading to nausea and vomiting. In this patient, the etoposide likely stimulated the CTZ, causing the symptoms of nausea and vomiting.

Metoclopramide, an antiemetic medication, works by blocking the dopamine receptors in the CTZ, which helps to reduce nausea and vomiting. The patient's symptoms improved significantly after receiving metoclopramide, supporting the idea that the area postrema was involved in the pathophysiology of their symptoms.

The other options are not directly related to the mechanism of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting:

A. Vestibular nerve: involved in balance and equilibrium, not nausea and vomiting.

B. Intestinal smooth muscle: while chemotherapy can affect gut motility, this is not the primary mechanism of nausea and vomiting in this scenario.

C. Vagus nerve: while the vagus nerve is involved in the vomiting reflex, it is not the primary site of action for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

D. Cerebral cortex: not directly involved in the vomiting reflex or the mechanism of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

Therefore, the correct answer is E. Area postrema.",Success

A 6 cm burn is present on the right arm. His vitals are within normal limits except for mild tachypnea at 21/min. Which of the following diagnostic tests should be conducted first to evaluate this patient?",C,"The correct answer is B. Urine dipstick.

Here's why:

The patient has been struck by a high-voltage power line, which can cause cardiac arrest, muscle damage, and renal injury due to rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of muscle tissue). The patient is experiencing severe pain in the flanks, which is a common symptom of renal damage.

A urine dipstick is a quick and non-invasive test that can detect the presence of myoglobin, a protein released from damaged muscle cells, in the urine. Myoglobinuria is a hallmark of rhabdomyolysis, and a positive dipstick test would suggest renal damage.

While the other options may be relevant in the patient's evaluation, they are not the first priority:

A. FAST ultrasound assessment is a trauma evaluation tool to detect intra-abdominal bleeding, which is not the primary concern in this scenario.

C. Urinalysis is a more comprehensive test that would provide more information about the patient's renal function, but it would take longer to obtain results compared to a urine dipstick.

D. X-ray of the arm and shoulder may be necessary to evaluate the extent of the burn and potential skeletal injuries, but it is not the first priority in this scenario.

E. EEG (electroencephalogram) is not relevant in this scenario, as the patient is alert and there is no indication of neurological compromise.

According to current medical guidelines, patients with electrical injuries should be evaluated for potential renal damage, and a urine dipstick is a rapid and effective way to detect myoglobinuria.",Success
"A 69-year-old male presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath. The patient has presented three times this past month with similar complaints.

On physical exam you note a fatigued appearing gentleman. Cardiovascular exam reveals an additional heart sound after S2. Pulmonary exam is notable for bilateral crackles. Abdominal exam reveals an obese abdomen without pain in any of the quadrants. Lower extremity pitting edema is noted bilaterally. Which of the following sets of lab values most likely corresponds to this patient's presentation?",C,"The correct answer is C. High BNP, high ADH, low sodium, low potassium.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation is consistent with heart failure (HF), which is supported by the following findings:

* Shortness of breath (dyspnea) on exertion
* Bilateral crackles on pulmonary exam, indicating fluid accumulation in the lungs
* Bilateral pitting edema in the lower extremities, suggesting fluid retention
* An additional heart sound after S2, which could be an S3 gallop, a common finding in HF
* Fatigued appearance and multiple recent presentations to the emergency department with similar complaints

Given this clinical picture, we can expect the following lab values:

* High BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide): BNP is a hormone released by the heart in response to ventricular stretch and pressure overload, which is common in HF. Elevated BNP levels are a sensitive marker for HF.
* High ADH (antidiuretic hormone): ADH is released in response to volume depletion or decreased cardiac output, which can occur in HF. Elevated ADH levels can lead to water retention and hyponatremia (low sodium levels).
* Low sodium: As mentioned earlier, elevated ADH levels can cause water retention, leading to dilutional hyponatremia.
* Low potassium: HF can lead to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which can cause potassium loss in the urine, resulting in hypokalemia (low potassium levels).

The other options do not align with the patient's presentation and expected lab values:

A. High BNP, high ADH, high sodium, high potassium: This combination is unlikely, as HF would typically lead to hyponatremia and hypokalemia, not hypernatremia and hyperkalemia.

B. High BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, low potassium: This option is inconsistent with the expected response to HF, which would typically involve elevated ADH levels.

D. Low BNP, high ADH, low sodium, low potassium: This option is unlikely, as the patient's presentation is consistent with HF, which would typically lead to elevated BNP levels.

E. Low BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, normal potassium: This option is inconsistent with the patient's presentation and expected lab values, as HF would typically lead to elevated BNP and ADH levels, as well as electrolyte abnormalities.",Success

Serum aspartate aminotransferase 88 U/L
Serum alkaline phosphatase
350 U/L (5.83 μkat/L)
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

Here's why:

The patient presents with symptoms and signs of acute cholangitis, including fever, right upper quadrant pain, and laboratory results indicating a bile duct obstruction (elevated total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels). The bedside ultrasonogram shows a dilated common bile duct, but no stone in the common bile duct or gallbladder, suggesting that the stone may have passed into the bile duct.

Given the patient's acute symptoms and laboratory results, urgent intervention is necessary to relieve the bile duct obstruction and treat the cholangitis. ERCP is the most appropriate next step in management because it allows for both diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. During ERCP, the stone can be removed from the bile duct, and any other bile duct abnormalities can be identified and treated.

Urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Option A) is not the most appropriate next step because the primary issue is the bile duct obstruction, not the gallbladder. Medical management followed by elective laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy (Options B and C) may be considered for patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis, but it is not the most appropriate approach for acute cholangitis. Cholecystotomy (Option E) is not a commonly performed procedure and is not indicated in this scenario.

The patient recently started college and has presented to the emergency department once before for polysubstance intoxication. The patient attempts to assault a nurse, is restrained, and given diphenhydramine and haloperidol. When the patient is able to be examined, he is somnolent and non-responsive. His temperature is 104°F (40°C), blood pressure is 147/98 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. He does not comply with any commands, and it is not possible to freely manipulate his extremities due to rigidity. His mucous membranes are dry. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is B. Heat stroke.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as undressing in hot weather, altered mental status, and elevated body temperature (104°F), are consistent with heat stroke. Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's temperature regulation system is overloaded, causing the body temperature to rise rapidly. It is often associated with dry mucous membranes, which is also present in this patient.

The patient's rigidity and non-responsiveness could be attributed to the heat stroke, as it can cause central nervous system dysfunction. The patient's vital signs, such as elevated blood pressure and pulse, are also consistent with heat stroke.

While the patient's history of polysubstance intoxication and recent college enrollment may suggest substance abuse, there is no clear evidence of overdose or intoxication in this scenario.

Catatonic schizophrenia (A) is a psychiatric condition characterized by immobility, mutism, and rigidity, but it is not typically associated with elevated body temperature or dry mucous membranes.

Malignant hyperthermia (C) is a rare genetic disorder that is usually triggered by certain medications or medical conditions, and it is not a likely diagnosis in this scenario.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (D) is a rare but life-threatening side effect of antipsychotic medications, which can cause hyperthermia, rigidity, and altered mental status. However, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with heat stroke, and there is no clear evidence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome in this scenario.

Oversedation (E) is unlikely, as the patient was given diphenhydramine and haloperidol to calm him down, but his symptoms are not consistent with oversedation.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination, heat stroke is the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vaginal discharge. She gave birth to a healthy baby boy three days prior to presentation. Since then, she has been feeling sick, and she is concerned that she has been getting worse over time. On presentation, her temperature is 100.7°F (38.1°C), blood pressure is 115/78 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 14/min. Physical exam reveals abdominal discomfort with uterine tenderness, and laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count with many plasma cells. The most likely cause of this patient's disorder has which of the following characteristics?",B,"The correct answer is C. Coagulase-negative cocci in clusters.

The patient's symptoms, such as abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and uterine tenderness, are consistent with endometritis, a common postpartum infection. The laboratory result showing an elevated white blood cell count with many plasma cells supports this diagnosis.

The most likely cause of endometritis in this patient is Staphylococcus epidermidis, a coagulase-negative staphylococcus that is commonly found on the skin and mucous membranes. It is a common cause of postpartum infections, including endometritis.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Alpha-hemolytic cocci in chains are characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is not typically associated with postpartum endometritis.

B. Beta-hemolytic cocci in chains are characteristic of Streptococcus agalactiae (Group B Strep), which can cause postpartum infections, but it is not the most likely cause in this scenario.

D. Coagulase-positive cocci in clusters are characteristic of Staphylococcus aureus, which can cause postpartum endometritis, but it is less common than S. epidermidis.

E. Gamma-hemolytic cocci in chains are not a characteristic of any specific bacterium and are not relevant to this scenario.

It's essential to note that a definitive diagnosis would require further testing, such as a culture of the uterine tissue or blood, but based on the symptoms and laboratory results, S. epidermidis is the most likely cause.",Success
"An 18-month-old boy is brought to his pediatrician because his mother is concerned about his walking. The boy was born at 37 weeks’ gestation and spent 1 night in the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress. He otherwise has been healthy and started walking independently at 12 months. However, his mother reports that he has stopped walking and appears weaker than he was a few months ago. He also has started having brief convulsive episodes over the past week. His parents are both healthy with no medical conditions. On exam, the child demonstrates muscle rigidity and diffuse muscle wasting. He is unable to stand or sit up straight. His patellar, Achilles, and brachioradialis reflexes are absent. Fundoscopic examination is unremarkable. A urine sample demonstrates metachromic granules. This patient’s condition is caused by a defect in which of the following enzymes?",B,"The correct answer is B. Arylsulfatase A.

This patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD), a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase A. The presence of metachromic granules in the urine is a characteristic feature of MLD.

The patient's history of normal development followed by regression, muscle weakness, and convulsive episodes is consistent with MLD. The physical examination findings of muscle rigidity, diffuse muscle wasting, and absent reflexes also support this diagnosis.

Arylsulfatase A is responsible for breaking down sulfatides, a type of lipid molecule, in the lysosomes. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to the accumulation of sulfatides in the central and peripheral nervous systems, causing demyelination and nerve damage.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Alpha-galactosidase A deficiency causes Fabry disease, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by skin lesions, kidney damage, and cardiovascular disease.

C. Beta-galactocerebrosidase deficiency causes Krabbe disease, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and death in early childhood.

D. Beta-glucocerebrosidase deficiency causes Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatosplenomegaly.

E. Hexosaminidase A deficiency causes Tay-Sachs disease, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and death in early childhood.

It's essential to note that MLD is a rare condition, and a definitive diagnosis requires enzyme assays or molecular genetic testing.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care provider for two weeks of low-grade fever and sore throat. Upon further questioning, the patient is found to have unprotected sex with both men and women with 3-5 partners per month. On workup, he is found to have an HIV viral load of 15,000 copies/mL with a CD4+ of 170 cells/mm^3. He is started on medical therapy. What should be included in his medication regimen?",D,"The correct answer is A. Azithromycin.

The patient is HIV-positive with a low CD4+ count (170 cells/mm^3), which puts him at risk for opportunistic infections. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is commonly used for prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with CD4+ counts <200 cells/mm^3. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend azithromycin as part of the prophylactic regimen for MAC in HIV-infected individuals.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's HIV diagnosis or CD4+ count:

B. Dapsone is an antibiotic used to treat Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), another opportunistic infection in HIV patients. While it's an important medication, it's not specifically indicated for MAC prophylaxis.

C. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections, such as candidiasis. While it may be used in HIV patients, it's not directly related to the patient's current presentation or CD4+ count.

D. Folinic acid is a form of folic acid, a vitamin. It's not a medication specifically indicated for HIV treatment or prophylaxis.

E. Tetrahydrofolic acid is a metabolite of folic acid, but it's not a medication used in HIV treatment or prophylaxis.

In summary, azithromycin is the correct answer because it's a recommended medication for MAC prophylaxis in HIV patients with low CD4+ counts.",Success
"A 71-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of a pigmented lesion on her left foot. She has had decreased appetite and a 6-kg (13-lb) weight loss in the past 2 months. Physical examination shows that on the left medial ankle there is a 2-cm reddish-black nodule with a verrucous surface. A full-thickness excisional biopsy of the lesion shows S100-protein-positive epithelioid cells. A subsequent CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows metastases to the liver; a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma is made. Chemotherapy with aldesleukin is initiated. Which of the following is the mechanism of action for this drug?",D,"The correct answer is D. Activating natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells.

Aldesleukin, also known as interleukin-2 (IL-2), is a recombinant cytokine that stimulates the immune system to fight cancer cells. Its mechanism of action involves activating natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells, which are types of immune cells that can recognize and destroy cancer cells. IL-2 works by binding to specific receptors on these immune cells, triggering a cascade of signals that ultimately lead to their activation, proliferation, and differentiation into cytotoxic effector cells.

The other options are not correct:

A. Stimulating release of acute-phase reactants: This is not a mechanism of action for aldesleukin. Acute-phase reactants are proteins produced in response to inflammation, and while IL-2 may induce some inflammatory responses, this is not its primary mechanism of action.

B. Stimulating antigen-processing cells: While IL-2 can stimulate the activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells, this is not its primary mechanism of action in cancer treatment.

C. Inhibiting expression of MHC II and Th1 cytokines: This is the opposite of what IL-2 does. IL-2 can actually upregulate the expression of MHC II molecules and Th1 cytokines, which are important for immune responses against cancer cells.

E. Supporting growth of bone marrow stem cells: While IL-2 can have some effects on hematopoiesis, its primary mechanism of action in cancer treatment is to activate immune cells, not to support the growth of bone marrow stem cells.

It's worth noting that aldesleukin is an FDA-approved treatment for metastatic melanoma, and its use is supported by clinical trials demonstrating improved response rates and overall survival in patients with this disease.",Success
A 27-year-old female presents to her physician with a palpable thyroid nodule. Iodine uptake testing shows that the nodule has decreased iodine uptake compared with the rest of the thyroid gland. A fine-needle aspiration is performed and the physician calls telling the patient that she has a neoplasm of the thyroid. Which of the following diagnoses is the most likely?,A,"The correct answer is C. Follicular carcinoma.

Here's why:

* The patient presents with a palpable thyroid nodule, which is a common presentation for thyroid cancer.
* The iodine uptake test shows decreased iodine uptake in the nodule compared to the rest of the thyroid gland. This suggests that the nodule is ""cold,"" meaning it is not functioning normally. Cold nodules are more likely to be malignant than hot nodules.
* The fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy result shows a neoplasm, which is a broad term that encompasses both benign and malignant tumors.
* Given the combination of a cold nodule and a neoplastic FNA result, the most likely diagnosis is follicular carcinoma. Follicular carcinoma is a type of thyroid cancer that often presents as a cold nodule on iodine uptake testing. It is also more likely to have a neoplastic FNA result compared to other types of thyroid cancer.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* A. Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer, but it often presents as a hot nodule on iodine uptake testing, not a cold nodule.
* B. Medullary carcinoma is a type of thyroid cancer that arises from the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland. It is less common than follicular carcinoma and often presents with elevated calcitonin levels, which is not mentioned in this scenario.
* D. Anaplastic carcinoma is a rare and aggressive type of thyroid cancer that often presents with a large, invasive tumor. It is unlikely to present as a small, palpable nodule.
* E. Hurthle cell carcinoma is a type of follicular carcinoma that is composed of Hurthle cells. While it is possible that the patient has a Hurthle cell carcinoma, the term ""neoplasm"" in the FNA result is more consistent with a diagnosis of follicular carcinoma.

It's worth noting that the diagnosis of thyroid cancer often requires a combination of clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings. This scenario is based on a limited set of information, and a definitive diagnosis would require further evaluation and testing.",Success
"A 58-year-old male presents with an acutely elevated blood pressure of 220/140 mmHg. The patient complains of a headache and chest pain, and he has been vomiting for the last several hours. Physical exam demonstrates papilledema and a depressed level of consciousness. To treat this patient's hypertensive emergency, he is started on an IV medication commonly used in this situation. The agent exerts its effect by releasing nitric oxide as a metabolite, which subsequently activates guanylate cyclase and increases production of cGMP in vascular smooth muscle. Which of the following clinical effects would be expected from administration of this medication?",D,"The correct answer is D. Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

The medication being described is sodium nitroprusside, which is commonly used to treat hypertensive emergencies. Sodium nitroprusside releases nitric oxide as a metabolite, which activates guanylate cyclase and increases the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in vascular smooth muscle. This leads to relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and vasodilation.

The clinical effects of sodium nitroprusside include:

* Decreased systemic vascular resistance (not increased, as stated in option E)
* Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (correct answer D) due to vasodilation and decreased preload
* Decreased blood pressure (which is the desired effect in this patient with hypertensive emergency)

Options A, B, and C are incorrect because:

* Sodium nitroprusside does not directly affect cardiac contractility (option A).
* It does not increase left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (option B), but rather decreases it due to reduced preload.
* It does not decrease stroke volume (option C), as the decreased afterload and preload can actually increase stroke volume.

It's essential to note that sodium nitroprusside should be used with caution and close monitoring, as it can cause hypotension, tachycardia, and other adverse effects.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman delivers a baby at term. The Apgar counts are 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Thirty minutes after delivery, the mother’s blood pressure drops to 80/60 mm Hg and her pulse is 124/min. On physical examination, her distal extremities are clammy and cold, and the uterus is boggy. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is initiated. After administering 4 units of IV fluids and 4 units of whole blood, her vitals stabilize. The next morning, she says she is unable to lactate when she tries to breastfeed her child. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the failure of lactation in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Pituitary infarction.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including hypotension, tachycardia, and a boggy uterus, suggest postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). The administration of IV fluids and whole blood helped stabilize her vitals. However, the patient's inability to lactate after PPH is a red flag for pituitary infarction, also known as Sheehan's syndrome.

Sheehan's syndrome is a rare but serious complication of PPH, where the pituitary gland is damaged due to ischemia or infarction caused by severe blood loss. This can lead to hypopituitarism, which affects hormone production, including prolactin, necessary for lactation.

Option A, pituitary tumor, is unlikely to be related to the patient's PPH and lactation failure. Option B, postpartum blues, is a common emotional response to childbirth but is not related to lactation failure. Option C, retained placenta, may contribute to PPH but is not directly related to lactation failure. Option E, pituitary hemorrhage, is a possibility, but pituitary infarction is a more likely cause of lactation failure in this scenario.

It's essential to note that Sheehan's syndrome is a rare complication, and other causes of lactation failure should be ruled out. However, given the patient's history of PPH and the symptoms described, pituitary infarction is the most likely cause of lactation failure.",Success
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of fatigue and yellow discoloration of his skin. One week ago, he had an upper respiratory tract infection. Examination shows jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae. The spleen tip is palpated 2 cm below the left costal margin. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.4 g/dl and his mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is 39% Hb/cell. A Coombs test is negative. A peripheral blood smear is shown. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?",C,"The correct answer is E. Splenic sequestration crisis.

The patient's symptoms, examination findings, and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis, a genetic disorder characterized by the production of abnormal red blood cells that are spherical in shape rather than the normal biconcave disk shape. The peripheral blood smear shows spherocytes, which are small, dark-staining red blood cells that are lacking in central pallor.

Hereditary spherocytosis is associated with an increased risk of splenic sequestration crisis, which occurs when the spleen suddenly traps a large number of red blood cells, leading to a rapid decrease in hemoglobin levels and potentially life-threatening complications. This is a common complication in children with hereditary spherocytosis, especially during periods of viral infections.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:

A. Malaria is a parasitic infection that can cause anemia and jaundice, but it is not a complication of hereditary spherocytosis.

B. Acute myelogenous leukemia is a type of cancer that can cause anemia and jaundice, but it is not a complication of hereditary spherocytosis.

C. Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, which is not related to hereditary spherocytosis.

D. Renal papillary necrosis is a complication of sickle cell disease, not hereditary spherocytosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is E. Splenic sequestration crisis.",Success
"A 27-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a general checkup. She has been doing well in school and has no complaints. The patient has a past medical history of asthma which is controlled with albuterol. She is currently sexually active but states that she uses birth control. She has many friends and states that her mood is typically positive. The patient's last pap smear was 1 year ago. Her father died of colon cancer at the age of 68, and her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 65. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 147/108 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's BMI is 19 kg/m^2. Physical exam demonstrates a normal S1 and S2, normal breath sounds, and an abdominal exam that is within normal limits. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is D. Pregnancy test.

Justification:

The patient presents for a general checkup, and her vital signs are notable for elevated blood pressure (147/108 mmHg). Although she reports using birth control, it is essential to rule out pregnancy as a potential cause of hypertension. Hypertension is a common complication of pregnancy, and it's crucial to diagnose and manage it promptly to prevent maternal and fetal complications.

The patient's past medical history of asthma is well-controlled, and her last pap smear was only 1 year ago, so there is no indication for an immediate repeat pap smear (Option C). The family history of colon cancer and breast cancer is important, but it does not warrant immediate action, such as a colonoscopy (Option A), at this age.

Discontinuing birth control and placing an intrauterine device (Option B) is not indicated based on the information provided. The patient's BMI is 19 kg/m^2, which is within the normal range, so recommending weight loss (Option E) is not necessary.

Therefore, the best next step in management is to perform a pregnancy test (Option D) to rule out pregnancy as a potential cause of the patient's hypertension.",Success
"A 25-year-old woman presents generalized abdominal pain and vomiting for the past hour. She has also had watery diarrhea for several days with no blood or pus in the stools. She is taking an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication, which she cannot remember the name of, and drinking oral rehydration solution, which has helped a little. Her past medical history shows she was hospitalized 10 years ago for an appendectomy and 4 years ago for a fractured ulna following a motor vehicle accident. Vital signs are pulse is 104/min, blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 14/min with shallow breathing, and temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F). On physical examination, pupils are constricted. Extremities are pale and cold. The abdomen is soft but mildly, diffusely tender to palpation with a palpable bladder. No rebound or guarding. Fingerstick blood glucose is 124 mg/dL. Laboratory tests are pending. A urinary catheter is placed, and intravenous fluids are started. Abdominal imaging shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Administer naloxone.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest opioid toxicity, likely due to the anti-diarrheal medication she is taking. The constricted pupils, pale and cold extremities, and shallow breathing are all consistent with opioid overdose. The fact that she has been taking an anti-diarrheal medication, which is often containing opioids such as loperamide, further supports this diagnosis.

Naloxone is a specific antidote for opioid overdose and is the next best step in management. It can help reverse the opioid-induced respiratory depression and other symptoms.

Option B, administering opioid analgesics, would worsen the situation and is contraindicated.

Option C, scopolamine patch, is not related to opioid toxicity and is not indicated in this scenario.

Option D, starting a dextrose infusion, may be necessary if the patient's blood glucose level is low, but it is not the primary concern in this situation.

Option E, performing a gastric lavage, is not necessary and may even be harmful in this case, as the patient has already been vomiting and there is no evidence of a toxic ingestion.

It's important to note that the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings should be closely monitored, and further management may include supportive care, such as oxygen therapy and cardiac monitoring, as well as consideration of other potential causes of her symptoms.",Success
"A 26-year-old man with no significant past medical history presents to the ED following a motor vehicle accident.

He complains of extreme abdominal pain worse in the left upper quadrant which has worsened over the past 30 minutes. Exam demonstrates abdominal wall rigidity, involuntary guarding, and tenderness on light percussion. Bedside sonography shows evidence for hemoperitoneum. Despite administering more intravenous fluids, repeat vitals are T 98.9 F, BP 82/50 mm hg, HR 180 bpm, RR 20/min, SpO2 97% on room air. Which of the following is the best next step?",E,"The correct answer is E. Exploratory laparotomy.

Here's why:

The patient presents with signs of hypovolemic shock (tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased SpO2) and abdominal trauma (abdominal wall rigidity, involuntary guarding, and tenderness on light percussion). The bedside sonography shows evidence of hemoperitoneum, which suggests active bleeding. Despite administering IV fluids, the patient's vitals worsen, indicating ongoing bleeding and hemodynamic instability.

Given the patient's unstable condition and the presence of hemoperitoneum, the best next step is to take the patient to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy to control the bleeding and repair any injuries. This is in line with the American College of Surgeons' (ACS) guidelines for the management of blunt abdominal trauma.

Option A, normal saline bolus and re-evaluation of hemodynamics, may provide temporary stabilization, but it is not a definitive treatment for the patient's life-threatening bleeding.

Option B, CT abdomen and pelvis, is not the best next step because it would delay definitive treatment and may not provide additional information that would change the management of the patient's bleeding.

Option C, morphine, is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient's primary issue is bleeding and shock, not pain management.

Option D, abdominal plain film, is not a useful diagnostic tool in this scenario, as it would not provide information about the source of bleeding or guide management.

In summary, the patient's unstable condition, presence of hemoperitoneum, and worsening vitals despite fluid administration make exploratory laparotomy the best next step.",Success

pH 7.32
PCO2 33 mm Hg
PO2 73 mm Hg
HCO3 22 mEq/L
O2 saturation 73%
Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?""",C,"The correct answer is C. Reintubate.

Here's why:

The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.32, indicating respiratory acidosis. The PO2 of 73 mm Hg and O2 saturation of 73% indicate hypoxia, despite being on a non-rebreather mask with an FiO2 of 100%. The patient's unresponsiveness and hypoxia suggest that they are not getting adequate oxygenation.

Reintubation is the best next step in management because it will allow for more effective oxygenation and ventilation. The patient's respiratory acidosis and hypoxia are likely due to respiratory failure, which is not being adequately addressed with the current non-rebreather mask.

Option A, performing a tracheostomy, is not indicated at this time. While the patient may eventually require a tracheostomy if they require prolonged mechanical ventilation, it is not the best immediate step in management.

Option B, continuing to use the non-rebreather mask, is not sufficient to address the patient's hypoxia and respiratory acidosis.

Option D, close observation only, is not appropriate given the patient's critical condition and need for immediate intervention.

Option E, starting BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure), may be considered in some cases of respiratory failure, but it is not the best option in this scenario. The patient's hypoxia and respiratory acidosis suggest that they require more aggressive respiratory support, which can only be provided with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.

"An 11-month-old male infant is brought to his pediatrician by his mother. She is concerned about his leg and his inability to stand. He was born vaginally to a 33-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) from an uncomplicated pregnancy at 39 weeks. He has met all developmental milestones and is up to date on all vaccinations. His mother explains that he can normally stand without help and can walk briefly on his own. However, he hit his right leg against a chair 2 days ago. The area became edematous and bruised overtime and the infant became unable to stand or crawl and cries when he puts weight on it. The mother denies any child abuse from her family or child care. The patient’s vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 137/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 36.7°C (97.0°F). His length and weight are both between the 15th and 25th percentile. On physical examination, blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae are noted. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits for his age. There is joint hypermobility and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities. The patient’s right calf appears slightly deformed, edematous, and warm to the tough. The patient begins to cry loudly when the physician palpates his leg. The patient’s X-ray shows an incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis. What is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Insufficient production of procollagen type 1.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones and skeletal fragility. The presence of blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae, joint hypermobility, and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities are all characteristic features of OI.

The incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis on X-ray further supports this diagnosis. OI is caused by mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, which code for type 1 collagen. This leads to insufficient production of procollagen type 1, resulting in brittle bones prone to fractures.

Child abuse (Option A) is unlikely given the mother's denial of abuse and the absence of any other signs of abuse or neglect. While child abuse can cause fractures, the presence of blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae and joint hypermobility points towards a underlying genetic disorder.

Mutations in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (Option C) are associated with Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by tall stature, long limbs, and cardiovascular abnormalities. This does not match the patient's symptoms.

Defective collagen type 3 (Option D) is associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a group of genetic disorders characterized by skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and tissue fragility. While there is some overlap with OI, the presence of blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae and the X-ray findings are more consistent with OI.

Dysfunctional structure of laminins (Option E) is not a known cause of brittle bones or skeletal fragility.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is insufficient production of procollagen type 1 due to Osteogenesis Imperfecta.",Success

He is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 92 kg (203 lb); BMI is 30.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a tender and mildly swollen left lower leg; dorsiflexion of the left foot causes severe pain in the calf. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 184,000/mm3, a prothrombin time of 11 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 26 seconds, and positive fibrin split products. Ultrasonography of the left leg shows incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow. The patient is administered a 5000 IU intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin followed by a constant infusion. Six hours later, the activated partial thromboplastin time is 30 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is C. Factor V Leiden.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The ultrasonography findings of incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow confirm the diagnosis. The patient's young age, lack of significant medical history, and family history of pulmonary embolism suggest a possible inherited thrombophilia.

The laboratory results show a normal platelet count, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time, which rule out bleeding disorders and liver dysfunction. The positive fibrin split products indicate the presence of thrombin and the formation of a thrombus.

Among the options, Factor V Leiden is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms. Factor V Leiden is a genetic mutation that increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) by making it more difficult for the body to break down clots. It is the most common inherited thrombophilia, affecting approximately 5% of Caucasians.

The other options are less likely:

A. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a condition characterized by elevated homocysteine levels, which can increase the risk of VTE. However, it is not typically associated with a family history of pulmonary embolism.

B. Antithrombin III deficiency is a rare inherited disorder that increases the risk of VTE. However, it is not as common as Factor V Leiden, and the patient's laboratory results do not suggest a bleeding disorder.

D. Protein C deficiency is another rare inherited disorder that increases the risk of VTE. However, it is not as common as Factor V Leiden, and the patient's laboratory results do not suggest a bleeding disorder.

E. Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that can increase the risk of VTE. However, it is typically associated with other symptoms such as recurrent miscarriages, thrombocytopenia, and livedo reticularis, which are not present in this patient.

The patient's response to unfractionated heparin, as evidenced by the prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, suggests that the treatment is effective in preventing further clot formation.",Success
"An 80-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of fatigue and lightheadedness. He does not have chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing. He has a history of hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and asthma. Current medications include simvastatin, metformin, lisinopril, albuterol, and ibuprofen. His pulse is 48/min and blood pressure is 89/50 mm Hg. He responds slowly to questions but is oriented to person, place, and time. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. His lungs are clear to auscultation and bowel sounds are positive with no pulsatile masses or bruits. Pedal pulses are nonpalpable, distal extremities are cold, and capillary refill time is 4 seconds. An ECG shows left axis deviation, a Q wave in lead III, a constant PR interval of 0.15 seconds with every third P wave that is nonconducted, and a QRS interval of .09 seconds. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Cardiac pacing.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms of fatigue and lightheadedness, along with his physical examination findings of dry mucous membranes, cold distal extremities, and nonpalpable pedal pulses, suggest hypoperfusion. His ECG shows a constant PR interval of 0.15 seconds with every third P wave that is nonconducted, which is consistent with a diagnosis of Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block.

The patient's bradycardia (heart rate of 48/min) and hypotension (blood pressure of 89/50 mm Hg) are likely due to the AV block, which is causing inadequate cardiac output. In this scenario, cardiac pacing is the most appropriate next step in management to restore a normal heart rate and improve cardiac output.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Dopamine is an inotrope that may increase cardiac contractility, but it will not address the underlying bradycardia and AV block.

B. Dobutamine is a beta-agonist that may increase heart rate and contractility, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient, as it may not address the underlying AV block.

C. Norepinephrine is a vasopressor that may increase blood pressure, but it will not address the underlying bradycardia and AV block.

E. Epinephrine is a non-selective beta-agonist that may increase heart rate and contractility, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient, as it may not address the underlying AV block and may cause tachycardia and arrhythmias.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA), recommend cardiac pacing as the primary treatment for symptomatic bradycardia due to AV block.",Success
"In a small town with a population of 10,000 people, the prevalence of alcohol use is estimated to be 30%. A study is done with a null hypothesis that there is no association between alcohol use and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The data obtained shows, of the 200 alcoholics who were followed-up, 30 developed GERD; and out of the 400 non-alcoholics, 30 developed GERD. What fraction of GERD can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed in this town?",A,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the population attributable risk (PAR), which is the fraction of GERD cases that can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed.

First, let's calculate the incidence of GERD in alcoholics and non-alcoholics:

Incidence of GERD in alcoholics = 30/200 = 0.15 (or 15%)
Incidence of GERD in non-alcoholics = 30/400 = 0.075 (or 7.5%)

Next, we need to calculate the population attributable risk (PAR). The formula for PAR is:

PAR = (Incidence of GERD in alcoholics - Incidence of GERD in non-alcoholics) / Incidence of GERD in alcoholics

PAR = (0.15 - 0.075) / 0.15
PAR = 0.075 / 0.15
PAR = 0.5

Since the population prevalence of alcohol use is 30%, we need to adjust the PAR accordingly:

Adjusted PAR = PAR x Prevalence of alcohol use
= 0.5 x 0.3
= 0.15

Now, we need to convert the adjusted PAR to a fraction. The total number of GERD cases in the population is 60 (30 in alcoholics + 30 in non-alcoholics).

Fraction of GERD that can be prevented = Adjusted PAR x Total number of GERD cases
= 0.15 x 60
= 9/60
= 3/20
= 39/400

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: 39/400.",Success
"A 41-year-old man presents to the clinic with the complaints of abdominal discomfort and cramping for the past 4 months. He also mentions that he has grossly bloody stool and most of the time an urge to defecate. He has a history of bulimia with laxative abuse several years ago. He admits having lost about 5 lb in the past month. His temperature is 37° C (98.6° F), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 77/min, and blood pressure is 105/86 mm Hg. On physical examination, a mild conjunctival pallor is evident, and the rectum is erythematous, indurated, and tender. Colonoscopy demonstrates continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon. What is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Ulcerative colitis.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, cramping, grossly bloody stool, and an urge to defecate, are consistent with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
* The presence of continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon on colonoscopy suggests a diffuse inflammatory process, which is more characteristic of ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease.
* Ulcerative colitis typically affects the rectum and colon, whereas Crohn's disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract.
* The patient's history of bulimia with laxative abuse several years ago may have contributed to the development of IBD, as laxative abuse can cause chronic inflammation and damage to the colonic mucosa.
* The patient's physical examination findings, such as mild conjunctival pallor and an erythematous, indurated, and tender rectum, are also consistent with ulcerative colitis.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:

* B. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the small intestine, causing malabsorption and diarrhea. While it can cause abdominal discomfort, it is less likely to cause grossly bloody stool and continuous mucosal lesions throughout the colon.
* C. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. It does not typically cause grossly bloody stool or mucosal lesions.
* D. Crohn's disease is a type of IBD that can cause similar symptoms to ulcerative colitis, but it tends to affect the entire gastrointestinal tract, and the colonoscopy findings are more consistent with ulcerative colitis.
* E. Laxative abuse may have contributed to the patient's symptoms, but it is not the primary diagnosis. The patient's symptoms and colonoscopy findings are more consistent with an underlying IBD, such as ulcerative colitis.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of bulimia with laxative abuse may have contributed to the development of ulcerative colitis, and it's essential to consider this factor in the patient's overall management and treatment plan.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to your office with a 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria), and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation. He has been evaluated by several practitioners, who have all prescribed antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, with no improvement and leading to emotional distress and sleep disturbances. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for a mildly tender prostate, without masses or nodules. There are no testicular masses, hernias, or hemorrhoids. Additionally to this health issue, you have also been following him for recurrent abdominal pain, periods of constipation and diarrhea, and fatigability, with all test results within the normal range thus far. A summary of recent tests is shown in the following table:
Urine test
Sample White cells Culture
Mid-stream urine Negative Negative
Expressed prostatic secretion Positive Negative
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including pelvic pain, irritative voiding symptoms, and painful ejaculation, are consistent with prostatitis. The presence of white cells in the expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) suggests inflammation, but the negative culture rules out bacterial infection. This combination of findings is characteristic of chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (A) is unlikely, as it typically presents with obstructive symptoms, such as hesitancy, straining, and weak stream, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.

Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis (C) is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms have been present for 2 years, and acute prostatitis typically presents with more severe symptoms, such as fever, chills, and acute urinary retention.

Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli (D) is unlikely, as the patient's cultures have been negative, and he has not responded to antimicrobial therapy.

Interstitial cystitis (E) is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with prostatitis, and the presence of white cells in the EPS supports this diagnosis.

It's worth noting that the patient's additional symptoms, such as abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, and fatigability, may be related to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or another condition, but they do not change the likelihood of chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis as the primary diagnosis.",Success
"An 18-year-old male presents to the emergency department trauma bay with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. The patient undergoes an exploratory laparotomy, during which, it is discovered that his splenic artery was damaged at its origin from the celiac trunk. The surgeon ligates the splenic artery at its origin. Which of the following arteries will now be hypoperfused as a result?",D,"The correct answer is D. Left gastroepiploic artery.

Here's why:

When the splenic artery is ligated at its origin from the celiac trunk, the blood supply to the spleen is compromised. The splenic artery also gives rise to the short gastric arteries and the left gastroepiploic artery, which supply the greater curvature of the stomach. Since the splenic artery is ligated, the left gastroepiploic artery, which is a branch of the splenic artery, will now be hypoperfused.

The other options are not correct because:

A. The left gastric artery arises from the celiac trunk, but it is not directly affected by the ligation of the splenic artery.

B. The gastroduodenal artery arises from the common hepatic artery, which is not affected by the ligation of the splenic artery.

C. The right gastroepiploic artery arises from the gastroduodenal artery, which is not directly affected by the ligation of the splenic artery.

HBsAg positive
HBeAg positive
IgM HBc negative
Total anti-HBc positive
Anti-HBs negative
Anti-HBc negative
HBV DNA greater than 1 million IU/mL
Alanine transferase normal",C,"The correct answer is C. Administer hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that all newborns born to mothers with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity receive both hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. This is because HBsAg-positive mothers can transmit the virus to their newborns during delivery, and the combination of vaccine and HBIG provides both passive and active immunity against hepatitis B.

In this scenario, the mother is known to be HBsAg positive, and the newborn is at high risk of contracting hepatitis B. Therefore, administering both hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG is the best course of action to prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis B.

Option A is incorrect because administering only the hepatitis B vaccine would not provide immediate protection against the virus. Option B is also incorrect because administering only HBIG would not provide long-term immunity against hepatitis B. Option D is incorrect because checking hepatitis B serology would not provide immediate protection against the virus, and the newborn's serology status is not relevant in this scenario. Option E is incorrect because checking liver enzymes is not necessary in this scenario, and it would not affect the decision to administer hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG.",Success

His temperature is 98.3°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 129/75 mmHg, pulse is 84/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for bilateral clear breath sounds, absence of lymphadenopathy on HEENT exam, and a normal oropharynx. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",E,"The correct answer is A. Chest radiograph.

Here's why:

The patient presents with a chronic cough and occasional hemoptysis (blood in the sputum) after a recent upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, bronchitis, pulmonary embolism (PE), and other less likely causes such as lung cancer or tuberculosis.

Given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, a chest radiograph is the best next step in management. A chest radiograph can help identify any parenchymal lung disease, such as pneumonia or bronchitis, and can also provide information about the presence of any nodules or masses that could be causing the hemoptysis.

A CT angiogram (Option B) is not necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms and physical exam do not suggest a high probability of pulmonary embolism. Additionally, a CT angiogram would expose the patient to a higher dose of radiation compared to a chest radiograph.

A D-dimer (Option C) is a test used to rule out pulmonary embolism, but it is not necessary in this case, as the patient's symptoms and physical exam do not suggest a high probability of PE.

A sputum culture (Option D) may be useful in identifying the causative organism of a respiratory infection, but it is not the best next step in management. The patient's symptoms have already resolved, and the sputum culture would not provide immediate information to guide management.

Supportive care (Option E) may be necessary, but it is not the best next step in management. The patient's symptoms need to be further evaluated to determine the underlying cause of the chronic cough and hemoptysis.

In summary, a chest radiograph is the best next step in management to evaluate the patient's symptoms and determine the underlying cause of the chronic cough and hemoptysis.",Success
"A 64-year-old man with multiple sclerosis comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of urinary incontinence. The urge to urinate occurs suddenly, and he often is unable to make it to the bathroom before leaking urine. He has no incontinence with coughing or laughing. Digital rectal examination shows no abnormalities. Ultrasonography shows a normal post-void residual volume. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's incontinence?",E,"The correct answer is E. Tolterodine.

The patient's symptoms of sudden urge to urinate and inability to make it to the bathroom before leaking urine are consistent with overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome, which is a common complication of multiple sclerosis. The patient's normal post-void residual volume on ultrasonography suggests that the incontinence is not due to urinary retention.

Tolterodine is an antimuscarinic medication that is specifically approved for the treatment of OAB syndrome. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors in the bladder, which helps to reduce urinary frequency, urgency, and incontinence.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient's incontinence:

A. Doxazosin is an alpha-blocker that is used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and hypertension. While it may help with urinary symptoms in men with BPH, it is not specifically indicated for OAB syndrome.

B. Midodrine is a vasoconstrictor that is used to treat orthostatic hypotension. It is not indicated for urinary incontinence.

C. Rivastigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that is used to treat dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. It is not indicated for urinary incontinence.

Her depression has improved, and she has stopped taking her sertraline 2 months ago. Other than ibuprofen as needed, she is not currently taking any additional medications. Which of the following would be the best treatment for her acute symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Sumatriptan.

The patient's symptoms, such as severe, pulsating pain around the crown of her head, nausea, and photophobia (sensitivity to light), are consistent with a migraine attack. The fact that she has a history of headaches and has not responded to ibuprofen suggests that her symptoms are not related to a tension headache or another type of headache.

Sumatriptan is a triptan medication, which is a first-line treatment for acute migraine attacks. Triptans work by constricting blood vessels and blocking pain pathways in the brain. They are effective in relieving migraine symptoms, including pain, nausea, and sensitivity to light and sound.

Option B, 100% oxygen, is not a recommended treatment for migraine attacks. While oxygen therapy may be used for cluster headaches, it is not effective for migraines.

Option C, propranolol, is a beta blocker that can be used as a preventive medication for migraines, but it is not effective for acute migraine attacks.

Option E, amitriptyline, is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used for migraine prevention, but it is not typically used for acute migraine attacks.

Option A, no treatment necessary, is not appropriate, as the patient is experiencing severe symptoms that require treatment.

The patient's current blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg. Analgesics are administered. The teacher states that he left the amputated finger in the classroom, but that the principal would be transporting it to the hospital. Which of the following is the correct method of transporting the amputated finger?",D,"The correct answer is D. Wrap finger in moist gauze, put in a plastic bag, and place on ice.

When transporting an amputated finger, it's essential to preserve the tissue to increase the chances of successful reattachment. The American Society for Surgery of the Hand recommends the following steps:

1. Wrap the amputated finger in moist gauze to prevent drying and tissue damage.
2. Place the wrapped finger in a plastic bag or airtight container to prevent further contamination and moisture loss.
3. Put the bag or container on ice to cool the tissue, which helps reduce metabolic activity and tissue damage. However, the finger should not be in direct contact with ice, as this can cause further tissue damage.

Options A and E are incorrect because submerging the finger in ice water can cause tissue damage and reduce the chances of successful reattachment. Option B is incomplete, as it doesn't provide adequate protection from contamination and temperature control. Option C is also incorrect, as the finger should be wrapped in a plastic bag or airtight container before placing it on ice.

It's essential to note that the amputated finger should be transported to the hospital as quickly as possible, and the patient should receive prompt medical attention to increase the chances of successful reattachment.",Success

Testosterone 2.2 nmol/L (N <3.5)
A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms?""",E,"The correct answer is E. Anovulation.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms of irregular menses, moderate to heavy flow, and recent amenorrhea (no menstrual bleeding for 3 months) suggest a hormonal imbalance. The serum hormone studies provide valuable clues:

* Prolactin levels are within normal limits, ruling out hyperprolactinemia as a cause of amenorrhea.
* Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are normal, indicating that thyroid dysfunction is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms.
* Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels are both within normal ranges, but the LH level is slightly elevated compared to FSH. This suggests that the patient may have a subtle imbalance in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis.
* Progesterone levels are low, indicating that ovulation is not occurring.
* Testosterone levels are within normal limits, making androgen excess (e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome, PCOS) less likely.

Given the patient's history of irregular menses, recent weight gain (BMI 27.02 kg/m2), and family history of PCOS, anovulation is the most likely cause of her symptoms. Anovulation is a common cause of amenorrhea in women of reproductive age, especially in those with a history of irregular menses.

The other options are less likely:

A. Uterine fibroids are unlikely to cause amenorrhea, and the patient's pelvic examination was normal.

B. Congenital defects of the Mullerian ducts would typically present with primary amenorrhea (never having had a menstrual period) rather than secondary amenorrhea (cessation of menses after previously having them).

C. Purging behavior, such as in eating disorders, can cause amenorrhea, but there is no indication of this in the patient's history or physical examination.

D. While the patient's family history of PCOS increases her risk, the hormone levels do not suggest androgen excess, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with anovulation.",Success

This patient is likely affected by a condition which is associated with which of the following options?",C,"The correct answer is D. Pheochromocytoma.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that produces excessive amounts of catecholamines (such as epinephrine and norepinephrine). The symptoms include:

* Sudden onset of high blood pressure (145/92 mm Hg)
* Episodic facial flushing or redness (noticed by her colleagues)
* Intermittent episodes of palpitations, headaches, and sweating (not explicitly mentioned but common in pheochromocytoma)
* Cold intolerance (using blankets to cover her feet, even in warm weather)
* Paradoxical warmth of the hands (hands feel warm to the touch despite cold intolerance)

The echocardiogram is likely ordered to rule out any cardiac causes of hypertension, but it may also incidentally identify any cardiac manifestations of pheochromocytoma, such as left ventricular hypertrophy or cardiac arrhythmias.

The other options are less likely:

A. Fibromuscular dysplasia is a vascular condition that can cause hypertension, but it is typically associated with renovascular hypertension and would not explain the patient's other symptoms.

B. Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue, leading to tall stature, arachnodactyly, and cardiovascular abnormalities. While it can cause hypertension, it is not typically associated with the patient's specific symptoms.

C. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females, causing short stature, ovarian failure, and cardiovascular abnormalities. It is not typically associated with hypertension or the patient's specific symptoms.

Which of the following drugs is responsible for the patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Bleomycin.

The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and CT scan results are consistent with bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity. The fine inspiratory crackles bilaterally and clubbing of the fingers suggest interstitial lung disease. The pulmonary function tests (PFTs) show a restrictive pattern, which is consistent with interstitial lung disease.

Bleomycin is a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used to treat testicular cancer, and it is known to cause pulmonary toxicity in up to 10% of patients. The toxicity can range from mild to severe and is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the lungs.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:

B. Carboplatin is a chemotherapeutic agent that can cause myelosuppression, nausea, and vomiting, but it is not typically associated with pulmonary toxicity.

The abdomen is soft on physical examination, and there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current renal findings?",D,"The correct answer is C. Dehydration.

Here's why:

The patient's reduced urine output and elevated serum creatinine concentration (2.9 mg/dL) suggest acute kidney injury (AKI). Given the patient's history and current presentation, dehydration is the most likely cause of AKI.

Several factors support this conclusion:

1. The patient is on bowel rest, which can lead to dehydration.
2. The patient is receiving ketoprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can cause vasoconstriction and reduce renal blood flow, exacerbating dehydration.
3. There is no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding (option A) or contrast administration (option D) that could cause AKI.
4. While the patient has a history of hypertension (option E), it is unlikely to be the primary cause of AKI in this scenario.
5. Adverse drug reaction (option B) is possible, but the patient's medications, including metoprolol and losartan, are not typically associated with AKI.

Dehydration is a common cause of AKI, especially in older adults, and it is likely that the patient's dehydration, combined with the use of ketoprofen, has contributed to his renal dysfunction.

It's essential to note that the patient's management should include aggressive fluid resuscitation to address dehydration and potentially discontinuing or reducing the dose of ketoprofen to minimize its nephrotoxic effects.",Success
"An immunology expert is delivering a talk on innate immunity. While talking about inflammasomes, he describes the process via an example: products of cellular stress are detected by NLRP3, which includes NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3; the latter interacts with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) via the pyrin domain, which leads to the formation of a protein speck that consists of multimers of ASC dimers. Which of the following enzymes will be activated as the next step in the process?",B,"The correct answer is B. Caspase 1.

Here's why:

Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that play a crucial role in innate immunity. The process described by the immunology expert involves the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is triggered by cellular stress products. The NLRP3 protein interacts with ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD) via its pyrin domain, leading to the formation of a protein speck consisting of multimers of ASC dimers.

The next step in this process is the activation of caspase 1, a cysteine protease that plays a central role in inflammasome signaling. Caspase 1 is recruited to the inflammasome complex, where it is activated through proximity-induced autoproteolysis. Activated caspase 1 then cleaves and activates pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), leading to their secretion and subsequent inflammatory responses.

The other options are not directly involved in the inflammasome signaling pathway:

A. Adenosine deaminase is an enzyme that converts adenosine to inosine and is not related to inflammasome signaling.

C. Protein kinase C is a family of enzymes involved in various cellular signaling pathways, but it is not directly involved in inflammasome activation.

D. Protein phosphatase is an enzyme that removes phosphate groups from proteins, but it is not specifically involved in inflammasome signaling.

E. Tyrosine kinase is an enzyme that adds phosphate groups to tyrosine residues on proteins, but it is not directly involved in inflammasome activation.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Caspase 1.",Success
The ribosome is an essential organelle that plays an important role in the synthesis of new proteins. The location of the ribosome within the cell can vary and provides a clue to the function of the particular cell. What ribosome location is essential for protein-secreting cells?,A,"The correct answer is A. Rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Ribosomes are indeed essential organelles responsible for protein synthesis. The location of ribosomes within a cell can provide clues about the cell's function. In protein-secreting cells, such as pancreatic acinar cells, plasma cells, or cells of the salivary glands, ribosomes are typically found attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER).

The RER is a type of endoplasmic reticulum that is studded with ribosomes, giving it a ""rough"" appearance under an electron microscope. The ribosomes attached to the RER synthesize proteins that are then translocated into the RER lumen for further processing, modification, and transport to the Golgi apparatus for secretion.

In contrast, smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is involved in lipid synthesis, detoxification, and calcium storage, but it is not typically associated with protein synthesis. Cytosol is the fluid component of the cytoplasm where some protein synthesis can occur, but it is not the primary location for protein-secreting cells. The cell membrane is not directly involved in protein synthesis, and the nucleus is the site of DNA transcription, not protein synthesis.

Therefore, option A, Rough endoplasmic reticulum, is the correct answer.",Success
"A patient presents to the emergency department with severe pain in her head. She states that the pain started 1 hour ago after rugby practice. Typically, she takes a special medication for bad headaches, but this time she took 2 doses and noticed no improvement in her symptoms. The patient's current medications that she can recall include sumatriptan and naproxen. She has been admitted to the hospital several times recently for panic attacks and suicide attempts. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 129/65 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient is given dihydroergotamine, IV fluids, and is started on 100% oxygen. Two hours later, the patient demonstrates slurring of her speech. On physical exam there is drooping of the left side of her mouth, and her left upper extremity demonstrates 2/5 strength. A head CT is ordered. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current presentation?",C,"The correct answer is E. Subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Here's why:

The patient presents with a severe headache, which is a common symptom of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The fact that the headache started suddenly after rugby practice suggests a possible traumatic event, which can cause SAH. The patient's history of taking sumatriptan, a triptan medication, and naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is relevant, as triptans can sometimes be used to treat migraines, but they are not typically effective for SAH.

The patient's symptoms, including slurred speech, drooping of the left side of her mouth, and weakness in her left upper extremity (2/5 strength), suggest a neurological deficit, which is consistent with SAH. The fact that the patient's symptoms worsened after administration of dihydroergotamine, a medication that can cause vasoconstriction, further supports this diagnosis.

A head CT is the appropriate diagnostic test to order in this scenario, as it can help identify blood in the subarachnoid space, which is a hallmark of SAH.

While hemorrhagic stroke (Option A) is a possibility, the patient's symptoms and presentation are more consistent with SAH. Ischemic stroke secondary to a thrombus (Option B) is less likely, as the patient's symptoms are more acute and severe than what is typically seen in ischemic stroke. Medication reaction (Option C) is possible, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a neurological event rather than a medication side effect. Psychogenic symptoms (Option D) are unlikely, given the patient's objective neurological deficits and the severity of her symptoms.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American Heart Association and the American Stroke Association, recommend prompt evaluation and imaging for patients presenting with sudden, severe headaches, especially if they have neurological deficits or other concerning symptoms.",Success
A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine gynecological examination and to refill her birth control pills. Her last pap smear at age 22 showed no intraepithelial lesions nor malignancy of the cervical cells. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 4 days. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with one male partner. Her father died of colon cancer at the age of 75 years and her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40 years. She mentions that she is planning a backpacking trip through Europe in 2 months. Her routine immunizations are all up-to-date. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F) and her blood pressure is 94/58 mm Hg. Pelvic and speculum examination show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the best recommendation for the patient at this time?,A,"The correct answer is A. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis screening.

Justification:

The patient is a 24-year-old sexually active woman, which puts her at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend annual screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea for all sexually active women aged 24 and younger. This is because chlamydia and gonorrhea are common and often asymptomatic, and early detection and treatment can prevent complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and infertility.

The patient's last Pap smear at age 22 showed no abnormalities, and she is not due for another Pap smear yet. The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) recommends Pap smears every 3 years for women aged 21-29 who have had a normal Pap smear.

There is no indication for a beta-hCG urine test, as the patient is not pregnant and is using birth control pills.

Mammography is not recommended for this patient, as she is under 40 years old and has no symptoms or risk factors for breast cancer. The American Cancer Society recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40.

Given the patient's age, sexual activity, and lack of symptoms, the best recommendation at this time is to screen her for chlamydia and gonorrhea.",Success
"A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient has a past medical history of asthma and cocaine use. His current medications include albuterol and ibuprofen. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 70/35 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On initial trauma evaluation, his airway is intact and he is breathing spontaneously. The patient's dorsalis pedis and radial pulses are palpable bilaterally. His Glasgow Coma Scale is 9. Head to toe examination reveals instability of the pelvis when downwards force is applied. The patient is started on IV fluids and norepinephrine, and a pelvic binder is placed. The patient's vitals are measured again and his temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 100/55 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. A blood transfusion is started, and the patient is given hydromorphone. The patient suddenly becomes short of breath with notable bilateral wheezing with poor air movement. His blood pressure is 60/35 mmHg and pulse is 160/min. The patient is treated appropriately, intubated, stabilized, and transferred to the surgical intensive care unit. Which of the following is most likely to be found in this patient's history?",A,"The correct answer is D. Hepatitis C infection.

The patient's history of cocaine use and IV drug abuse increases the risk of blood-borne infections, including hepatitis C. The scenario describes a trauma patient who requires blood transfusion, which further supports the likelihood of hepatitis C infection.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

A. Hemolytic anemia and ataxia: These symptoms are not directly related to the patient's presentation or medical history. While cocaine use can cause anemia, it is not typically hemolytic anemia.

B. Gum disease and poor wound healing: Although cocaine use can lead to poor oral health, the patient's history does not suggest a specific connection to gum disease or poor wound healing.

C. Irregularly irregular heart rhythm: There is no indication of cardiac arrhythmia or heart rhythm disturbances in the patient's presentation or medical history.

E. Anti-A, B, or O antibodies in the serum: This option is unrelated to the patient's medical history or presentation. The patient's reaction to the blood transfusion is more likely due to a allergic reaction or anaphylaxis rather than an immune response to blood type incompatibility.",Success
An academic obstetrician is conducting a retrospective cohort study that evaluates the risk of placenta accreta at all statewide medical centers. Per chart review he finds that a prior cesarian birth is associated with a statistically significant increased risk of placenta accreta. The relative risk associated with this finding is 1.23. The associated p-value is 0.03. Which of the following statements is the best interpretation of the reported association in the context of the study?,A,"The correct answer is B. The chance of bias in favor of the alternative hypothesis is 3%.

Here's why:

The p-value of 0.03 indicates that there is a 3% chance of observing the reported association (relative risk of 1.23) between prior cesarian birth and placenta accreta by chance alone, assuming that there is no real association between the two variables (i.e., the null hypothesis is true). This means that if the study were repeated many times, we would expect to see an association at least as strong as the one observed in this study about 3% of the time, even if there is no real effect.

In other words, the p-value represents the probability of obtaining the observed results (or more extreme results) by chance, if there is no real association between the variables. A p-value of 0.03 indicates that the observed association is statistically significant, meaning it is unlikely to be due to chance alone.

The other options are incorrect:

A. The 99% confidence interval would not include the null hypothesis, since the p-value is less than 0.05 (typically considered the threshold for statistical significance).

C. The p-value does not represent the likelihood of seeing an increased risk of placenta accreta in women with prior cesarian birth, assuming the alternative hypothesis is true. Instead, it represents the probability of observing the reported association by chance alone, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

D. The relative risk of 1.23 does not represent a probability of seeing the reported risk by chance alone. The p-value represents this probability.

E. The p-value does not represent the likelihood that the alternative hypothesis is false. Instead, it represents the probability of observing the reported association by chance alone, assuming the null hypothesis is true.",Success
"A 23-year-old man presents to his primary care physician after bleeding from his gums while brushing his teeth for the past week. Although he has had gum bleeding in the past, it has never been this severe. He has no family history available as he was adopted. He does not have any significant past medical history. His physical exam is within normal limits. Screening lab work is ordered with the following values:
Platelet count 330,000/mm3
Bleeding time 6 mins
Prothrombin time 12 sec
Activated partial thromboplastin time 42 sec
Factor VIII activity decreased
Ristocetin cofactor assay decreased
He is subsequently referred to a hematologist for further work-up and treatment. Which of the following aspects of coagulation would most likely be affected?",B,"The correct answer is B. Gp Ib.

The patient's lab results suggest a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (VWD), a bleeding disorder characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF). The decreased factor VIII activity and ristocetin cofactor assay are consistent with this diagnosis.

VWF is a protein that plays a crucial role in platelet adhesion and aggregation, as well as carrying and stabilizing factor VIII in the circulation. The ristocetin cofactor assay is a test that measures the ability of VWF to support platelet aggregation in the presence of ristocetin.

Gp Ib is a platelet surface receptor that interacts with VWF, facilitating platelet adhesion to the subendothelium. In VWD, the deficiency or dysfunction of VWF impairs this interaction, leading to abnormal platelet function and bleeding.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:

A. Factor IX is a clotting factor involved in the intrinsic pathway, but it is not directly related to VWD.

C. Factor XI is also a clotting factor, but it is not typically affected in VWD.

D. Vitamin K is essential for the production of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, but it is not directly related to VWD.

E. Antithrombin III is a natural anticoagulant that inhibits thrombin and other clotting factors, but it is not directly related to VWD.

The patient's symptoms and lab results are consistent with VWD, which affects the interaction between VWF and platelet Gp Ib, leading to abnormal platelet function and bleeding.",Success
"A 51-year-old Caucasian woman presents to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She had a Colles' fracture 2 years ago. The rest of her past medical history is unremarkable. She has a sedentary lifestyle. She has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. She drinks alcohol moderately. Her mother had a fracture of the wrist when she was in her late 60s. The physical examination shows no abnormal findings. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA scan) shows a T-score of -3.2 standard deviations (SDs) in the hip. The patient is educated regarding her risk of falls. Exercise regimen and smoking cessation assistance are provided. Appropriate diet is indicated, as well as supplements with calcium and vitamin D. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy?",A,"The correct answer is A. Alendronate.

This patient has a T-score of -3.2 SDs in the hip, which indicates severe osteoporosis. Given her history of Colles' fracture, sedentary lifestyle, and smoking, she is at high risk for future fractures. The patient has already been educated on fall prevention, and lifestyle modifications such as exercise and smoking cessation have been initiated. Dietary recommendations and calcium and vitamin D supplements have also been provided.

The next step in pharmacotherapy is to initiate a bisphosphonate, specifically alendronate, which is a first-line medication for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Alendronate has been shown to reduce the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in patients with osteoporosis.

Calcitonin (option B) is a second-line medication that may be used in patients who cannot tolerate bisphosphonates or have a contraindication to their use. Estrogen (option C) is not a recommended treatment for osteoporosis in this patient, as she is not experiencing menopausal symptoms and hormone replacement therapy is not indicated for osteoporosis prevention alone. Tamoxifen (option D) is a medication used to treat breast cancer and is not indicated for osteoporosis treatment. No pharmacotherapy at this time (option E) is not appropriate, as the patient's T-score indicates severe osteoporosis, and pharmacological treatment is necessary to reduce her risk of future fractures.

"A 33-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 26 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department because of frequent contractions. The contractions last 40 seconds, occur every 2 minutes, and are increasing in intensity. She has a history of recurrent painful ulcers on her vulva, but she currently does not have them. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a non-reassuring fetal heart rate. Her current medications include acyclovir, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate is 88/min, and blood pressure is 126/76 mm Hg. Contractions are felt on the abdomen. The cervix is dilated to 5 cm, 70% effaced, and the station of the head is -2. A fetal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is C. Initiate nifedipine therapy.

This patient is presenting with preterm labor, which is defined as regular uterine contractions that occur before 37 weeks of gestation. The patient's cervix is already 5 cm dilated, and the contractions are increasing in intensity, indicating that labor is progressing.

Given the patient's history of a previous cesarean section, vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) is a possibility. However, the patient is currently at 26 weeks' gestation, which is considered preterm, and VBAC is not recommended before 28 weeks.

Initiating misoprostol therapy (Option B) is not appropriate, as it is a medication used to induce labor, which is not the goal in this scenario. Instead, the goal is to slow down or stop the labor to allow the fetus to mature further.

Performing a cesarean delivery (Option D) may be necessary eventually, but it is not the most appropriate next step. The patient's cervix is still dilating, and attempting to stop the labor may be beneficial for the fetus.

Performing dilation and evacuation (Option E) is not relevant in this scenario, as it is a procedure used to terminate a pregnancy, which is not the goal here.

Nifedipine therapy (Option C) is a tocolytic medication that can help slow down or stop contractions, allowing the fetus to mature further. It is commonly used to manage preterm labor between 20 and 34 weeks of gestation. The patient's history of recurrent painful ulcers on her vulva suggests that she may have a history of herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is not a contraindication to nifedipine therapy.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to initiate nifedipine therapy to slow down or stop the labor and allow the fetus to mature further.",Success

Family history is non-significant, and the patient does not take any medications. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.9°F), blood pressure is 135/115 mm Hg, pulse is 85/min, and respiratory rate is 24/min. Physical examination reveals 2+ bilateral pitting edema. Chest auscultation reveals bibasilar crackles. Which of the following is associated with this patient’s condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with heart failure, likely due to long-standing hypertension and alcohol abuse. The presence of exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) suggests left ventricular dysfunction. The physical examination findings of bibasilar crackles and 2+ bilateral pitting edema further support this diagnosis.

In heart failure, the body's response to decreased cardiac output is to activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which leads to increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption. This results in increased fluid retention, exacerbating the edema and hypertension.

The other options are not directly associated with this patient's condition:

A. Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may be a complication of heart failure, but it is not a primary association.

B. Decreased vascular smooth muscle tone is not typically seen in heart failure, where vasoconstriction is more common.

C. Decreased extracellular fluid (ECF) volume is the opposite of what is seen in heart failure, where fluid retention and edema are common.

D. Increased renal blood flow is not a characteristic of heart failure, where decreased cardiac output and renal perfusion are more common.

Capillary refill is 2 seconds. Sensorimotor evaluation of the hand is without deficits. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment choice for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Amoxicillin-clavulanate.

Here's why:

The patient has been bitten by a stray dog and presents with localized cellulitis, which indicates a bacterial infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for dog bites that are deep, have broken the skin, or have caused significant tissue damage.

The most common pathogens associated with dog bites are Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus species. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers these pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.

Amoxicillin alone (Option A) may not be effective against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, which are commonly found in dog bite wounds. Clindamycin (Option C) is not the best choice because it has poor coverage against Pasteurella multocida. Doxycycline (Option D) is not typically used for dog bite wounds, and azithromycin (Option E) may not provide adequate coverage against Staphylococcus aureus.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend amoxicillin-clavulanate as the first-line treatment for dog bite wounds. Therefore, Option B, Amoxicillin-clavulanate, is the most appropriate treatment choice for this patient.",Success

Physical examination shows pitting edema over the ankles and feet and around his eyes. Abdominal examination is positive for ascites and hepatomegaly. Oral examination shows several missing teeth. Which of the following best explains these findings?",A,"The correct answer is A. Kwashiorkor.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Kwashiorkor, a severe form of protein-energy malnutrition. The key features that point to Kwashiorkor are:

1. Pitting edema: Edema is a hallmark feature of Kwashiorkor, particularly in the ankles, feet, and around the eyes.
2. Abdominal swelling and hepatomegaly: The presence of ascites and an enlarged liver are common in Kwashiorkor, indicating liver damage and fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity.
3. Irritability and lethargy: Children with Kwashiorkor often appear apathetic, lethargic, and irritable due to the underlying malnutrition.
4. Missing teeth: Kwashiorkor can cause impaired growth and development, including dental problems.

Kwashiorkor is often seen in children who have experienced chronic protein-energy malnutrition, which is consistent with the patient's history of displacement and inadequate nutrition and housing.

In contrast:

* Marasmus (B) is a form of protein-energy malnutrition characterized by wasting and emaciation, but it does not typically present with edema.
* Beriberi (C) is a condition caused by thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency, which can cause edema, but it is not typically associated with the other symptoms described.
* Rickets (D) is a condition caused by Vitamin D deficiency, which can cause skeletal deformities, but it is not typically associated with edema, ascites, or hepatomegaly.

The parents report that the patient’s vocabulary is still limited to fewer than 10 words, and he is still only using single words to describe things. The parents say that his motor milestones do not seem to be affected, as the patient is very physically active and can run and kick a ball. At times the patient seems hyperactive and can be difficult to redirect. On exam, his temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 14/min. The rest of the exam is unremarkable, except that the patient’s face appears to be abnormally long and narrow. The patient is further referred to a geneticist, as he is believed to have a trinucleotide repeat disorder. Which of the following is the most likely inheritance pattern of this disorder?",D,"The correct answer is A. Autosomal dominant.

Based on the patient's symptoms, particularly the speech delay, hyperactivity, and distinct facial features (long and narrow face), the geneticist is likely suspecting a diagnosis of Fragile X syndrome. Fragile X syndrome is a trinucleotide repeat disorder caused by an expansion of a CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene.

Fragile X syndrome has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition. This is because the FMR1 gene is located on the X chromosome, and the mutation leads to the silencing of the gene, resulting in the absence of the FMR1 protein.

The other options are not correct:

B. Autosomal recessive: This inheritance pattern would require two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to cause the condition, which is not the case in Fragile X syndrome.

C. Noninherited somatic mutation: This option is not applicable, as Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene, which is inherited from one's parents.

D. X-linked dominant: While the FMR1 gene is located on the X chromosome, the inheritance pattern of Fragile X syndrome is autosomal dominant, not X-linked dominant.

E. X-linked recessive: This inheritance pattern would require two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to cause the condition, which is not the case in Fragile X syndrome.

It's worth noting that Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability, and its diagnosis is often suspected based on the combination of physical and behavioral features, as well as family history.",Success

His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, it is impossible to follow the patient's sequence of thoughts. He is anxious and has a flat affect. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Schizophrenia.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, as described, are consistent with schizophrenia. The key features that support this diagnosis are:

1. **Duration of symptoms**: The patient has been experiencing symptoms for 7 months, which is consistent with the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, which requires a duration of at least 6 months.
2. **Psychotic symptoms**: The patient has delusions (believing aliens are watching him and stealing his thoughts) and disorganized thinking (difficulty following his sequence of thoughts). These are hallmark symptoms of schizophrenia.
3. **Negative symptoms**: The patient has a flat affect and has become withdrawn, which are common negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
4. **Lack of mood symptoms**: There is no indication of a mood disorder, such as depression or mania, which rules out option C.
5. **No evidence of substance-induced psychosis**: The patient does not drink alcohol and quit smoking marijuana 1 year ago, making it unlikely that his symptoms are substance-induced.

Option A, brief psychotic disorder, is unlikely because the patient's symptoms have persisted for 7 months, whereas brief psychotic disorder is characterized by a shorter duration of symptoms (less than 1 month).

Option B, delusional disorder, is also unlikely because the patient's symptoms extend beyond delusions, including disorganized thinking and negative symptoms.

Option D, schizoid personality disorder, is not supported by the patient's symptoms, as it is characterized by a pervasive pattern of social detachment and lack of emotional expression, but does not typically involve psychotic symptoms.

Cyclophosphamide is an immunosuppressant commonly used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus. It can cause hemorrhagic cystitis due to the toxic effects of its metabolite, acrolein, on the bladder mucosa.

Mesna is a medication that can help prevent hemorrhagic cystitis in patients receiving cyclophosphamide therapy. It works by binding to acrolein and reducing its toxic effects on the bladder mucosa. Therefore, if the patient had received mesna along with her immunosuppressant, it could have prevented or reduced the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis.

Ifosfamide (Option A) is another chemotherapeutic agent that can cause hemorrhagic cystitis, but it is not a preventative measure.

Methotrexate (Option C) is an immunosuppressant, but it is not typically associated with hemorrhagic cystitis.

Nitrofurantoin (Option D) is an antibiotic, and it is not related to the prevention of hemorrhagic cystitis.

Prednisone (Option E) is a corticosteroid that may be used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus, but it is not a preventative measure for hemorrhagic cystitis.",Success
"A 38-year-old woman presents to the office for a routine examination. She has no complaints and offers very little information voluntarily. She answers each question with soft, short sentences and avoids eye contact. She appears timid, anxious and admits that this is one of the very few times she has left the house in the last several years. Medical history is significant for essential hypertension. She takes hydrochlorothiazide and a daily vitamin. She has worked from home as a web graphic designer for 20 years. Questions about her social life reveal that she is very shy with few friends, and she often makes excuses to avoid parties and social gatherings. Despite this, she expresses a strong desire to be in a relationship. Today, her blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg, heart rate is 95/min, respiratory rate is 18/min, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, her heart has a regular rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Which of the following is most consistent with her behavior?",C,"The correct answer is C. Avoidant personality disorder.

The patient's behavior is most consistent with avoidant personality disorder, which is characterized by feelings of inadequacy, social inhibition, and avoidance of social interactions due to fear of criticism, rejection, or embarrassment. People with avoidant personality disorder often appear timid, anxious, and shy, and may avoid social situations or relationships due to these fears.

The patient's symptoms, such as:

* Avoiding eye contact
* Answering questions with short, soft sentences
* Admitting to rarely leaving the house
* Having few friends and avoiding social gatherings
* Expressing a strong desire to be in a relationship, but being too afraid to pursue it

are all consistent with avoidant personality disorder.

In contrast:

* Body dysmorphic disorder (A) is characterized by a preoccupation with a perceived flaw in one's appearance, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.
* Schizoid personality disorder (B) is characterized by a lack of interest in social relationships and a tendency to be detached from others, which is not consistent with the patient's expressed desire to be in a relationship.
* Antisocial personality disorder (D) is characterized by a disregard for others' rights and a tendency to engage in impulsive and irresponsible behavior, which is not consistent with the patient's shy and anxious behavior.
* Agoraphobia (E) is characterized by a fear of being in public places or situations where escape might be difficult, which may be a component of the patient's behavior, but is not the primary diagnosis.

It's worth noting that avoidant personality disorder often co-occurs with social anxiety disorder, which may also be a consideration in this patient's case.",Success
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother after she found him somnolent at home next to multiple open pill bottles. The boy had seemingly opened several different pill bottles that were in a cabinet in his parent’s bathroom. The mother has brought the empty bottles to the emergency room, and they include aspirin, metoprolol, acetaminophen, levothyroxine, and lorazepam. The boy has no past medical history and takes no medications. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 28/min. On exam, the boy is lethargic but responsive. He appears to be grasping at his ears and swaying from side-to-side when attempting to ambulate. He vomited once in the emergency room. Which of the following arterial blood gas readings is most likely to be found in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is B. pH 7.35, PCO2 29 mmHg, and HCO3- 15 mEq/L.

Let's break down the patient's presentation and the medications involved to justify this choice:

* The patient is a 3-year-old boy who ingested multiple medications, including acetaminophen, metoprolol, aspirin, levothyroxine, and lorazepam.
* The patient's symptoms include lethargy, grasping at his ears, and swaying from side-to-side when attempting to ambulate, which are consistent with a sedative-hypnotic overdose, likely due to the lorazepam ingestion.
* The patient vomited once in the emergency room, which may indicate some degree of gastrointestinal irritation, possibly related to the aspirin ingestion.
* The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a normal temperature, blood pressure, and pulse. However, the respiratory rate is slightly elevated, which may indicate some degree of respiratory compensation for a metabolic acidosis.

Considering the medications ingested, acetaminophen overdose can cause a metabolic acidosis, while aspirin overdose can cause a mixed acid-base disorder with both metabolic and respiratory components. Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, can cause respiratory depression, which may contribute to a respiratory acidosis.

Given the patient's symptoms and the medications involved, the most likely arterial blood gas reading would be a mixed acid-base disorder with a slightly acidic pH, elevated PCO2, and a decreased HCO3-. Option B, pH 7.35, PCO2 29 mmHg, and HCO3- 15 mEq/L, is the most consistent with this scenario.

The other options do not fit the patient's presentation as well:

* Option A suggests a more severe metabolic acidosis, which is not consistent with the patient's relatively stable vital signs.
* Option C suggests a respiratory alkalosis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or the medications ingested.
* Option D suggests a metabolic alkalosis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or the medications ingested.
* Option E suggests a respiratory alkalosis with a compensatory metabolic alkalosis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or the medications ingested.",Success
"A 38-year-old man presents with progressive tiredness and shortness of breath on exertion. Past medical history is significant for peptic ulcer disease diagnosed 2 years ago for which he is not compliant with his medications. He reports a 10-pack-year smoking history and occasionally alcohol use. His vital signs include: temperature 37.1°C (98.7°F), blood pressure 142/91 mm Hg, pulse 98/min. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL
Hematocrit 29.1%
Red cell count 3.7 million/mm3
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 71 μm3
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 21.3 pg/cell
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 28.4 Hb/cell
Reticulocyte count 0.2 %
Red cell distribution width (RDW) 17.8 (ref: 11.5–14.5%)
White blood cell count 8100/mm3
Platelet count 420,000/mm3
Iron studies show:
Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) 620 μg/dL
Transferrin saturation 9%
Which of the following findings would most likely be found on a bone marrow biopsy in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. ↓ hemosiderin stores.

Here's why:

The patient's laboratory findings suggest iron deficiency anemia, which is characterized by:

* Low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels
* Microcytic anemia (low MCV)
* Low mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)
* Increased red cell distribution width (RDW)
* Low reticulocyte count
* Low transferrin saturation (9%)

Iron deficiency anemia is often caused by chronic blood loss, which is consistent with the patient's history of peptic ulcer disease. The low transferrin saturation and high total iron binding capacity (TIBC) also support this diagnosis.

A bone marrow biopsy in this patient would likely show decreased hemosiderin stores, which is a characteristic finding in iron deficiency anemia. Hemosiderin is a form of stored iron in the bone marrow, and decreased stores indicate iron deficiency.

The other options are not directly related to iron deficiency anemia:

A. Hypocellularity with fatty infiltration is more characteristic of aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.

B. ↑ megakaryocytes would be seen in conditions such as essential thrombocythemia or myeloproliferative neoplasms.

D. Ringed sideroblasts are seen in sideroblastic anemia, a condition characterized by abnormal iron accumulation in the mitochondria of erythroid precursors.

E. Myeloblasts with immature precursors would be seen in acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.

Therefore, option C, ↓ hemosiderin stores, is the most likely finding on a bone marrow biopsy in this patient.",Success
"A 27-year-old G3P1010 makes an appointment with her gynecologist for evaluation of profuse bleeding, which began two days ago. She is 13 weeks pregnant based on the date of her last menstrual period. She is dizzy and weak, and is unable to move around the house and perform her daily tasks. Initially, she had only light spotting, but later on in the day the bleeding increased. Thus far, she has used six sanitary pads. The blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, the temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), the pulse is 125/min, and the respiratory rate is 14/min. A saline infusion is started, and blood and urine specimens are sent for analysis. On pelvic examination, the vagina contains blood and the cervical os is open. She also complains of cervical motion and adnexal tenderness on examination. An ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac low in the uterine cavity. No fetal movement or cardiac activity are observed. She is advised to rest for a couple of hours, after which the scan is repeated. Slight downward migration of the gestational sac is observed with no change in the fetal status. Which of the following is the next step in management?",E,"The correct answer is E. Dilation and curettage.

Here's why:

The patient is experiencing profuse bleeding, dizziness, and weakness, indicating a potential life-threatening situation. The pelvic examination reveals an open cervical os, cervical motion, and adnexal tenderness, suggesting a miscarriage in progress. The ultrasound confirms an intrauterine gestational sac with no fetal movement or cardiac activity, indicating a non-viable pregnancy.

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the next step in management is to perform a dilation and curettage (D&C) to evacuate the uterus and control the bleeding. This procedure is necessary to prevent further bleeding, infection, and potential complications.

The other options are not appropriate at this stage:

A. Antibiotics are not indicated, as there is no evidence of infection.

B. Bed rest and analgesics may provide temporary relief, but they do not address the underlying issue of the non-viable pregnancy and ongoing bleeding.

C. Magnesium sulfate is not relevant to this scenario, as it is typically used to prevent seizures in preeclampsia or eclampsia.

D. Methotrexate is a medication used to terminate an ectopic pregnancy, which is not the case here, as the ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac.

In summary, the patient requires prompt intervention to control the bleeding and evacuate the uterus, making dilation and curettage the next step in management.",Success
"An otherwise healthy 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of pain and swelling of her right knee joint and left wrist. She went camping with her new boyfriend 3 weeks ago but does not recall any tick bites. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F). Examination of the right knee shows swelling, warmth, and tenderness on passive movement. There is a tender pustule on the sole of the left foot. Arthrocentesis of the right knee joint yields 8 mL of cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 45,000/mm3 (90% segmented neutrophils with intracellular organisms). Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for this patient's condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Sexually transmitted infection.

The patient's symptoms, including pain and swelling of the right knee joint and left wrist, along with the presence of a tender pustule on the sole of the left foot, are consistent with a diagnosis of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). The arthrocentesis results, showing cloudy fluid with a high leukocyte count and intracellular organisms, further support this diagnosis.

DGI is a complication of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection, which is typically acquired through sexual contact. The patient's recent camping trip with her new boyfriend suggests a possible exposure to the infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that healthcare providers consider DGI in patients with a history of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and compatible symptoms.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:

A. Autoantibody production is associated with autoimmune disorders, which are not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

B. Intravenous drug use is a risk factor for infectious diseases, but it is not specifically linked to DGI.

D. HLA-B 27 positivity is associated with certain autoimmune disorders, such as ankylosing spondylitis, but it is not a risk factor for DGI.

E. Bacterial pharyngitis is an infection of the throat, which is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.

In summary, the strongest risk factor for this patient's condition is a sexually transmitted infection, specifically gonococcal infection.",Success
"A 54-year-old man comes to the clinic for management of his gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He is currently on cimetidine for his condition and reports that his GERD initially improved. However, following his recent move to Michigan, he is experiencing more frequent episodes of chest pain (4-5 times a week). The pain is described as burning in quality and is concentrated around his epigastric region following food ingestion. It does not radiate anywhere and is alleviated when he takes antacids. A physical examination demonstrates a healthy male with unremarkable findings. He is subsequently prescribed a new medication for control of his symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism of action of this new medication?",B,"The correct answer is D. Reversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells.

Given the patient's history of GERD and the need for a new medication to control his symptoms, it is likely that the new medication is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). PPIs are commonly used to treat GERD and work by reversibly inhibiting the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme at parietal cells in the stomach lining, thereby reducing gastric acid production.

Cimetidine, which the patient was previously taking, is a histamine H2 receptor antagonist, which also reduces gastric acid production but through a different mechanism. However, the patient's symptoms have not been adequately controlled with cimetidine, leading to the need for a new medication.

Option A refers to the mechanism of action of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which is not relevant to GERD treatment. Option B is incorrect because it describes the mechanism of action of PPIs as irreversible, whereas PPIs actually reversibly inhibit the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme. Option C is incorrect because it describes the mechanism of action of histamine H2 receptor antagonists, which the patient was already taking. Option E is incorrect because it describes a reversible inhibition of histamine H2 receptors, which is not the mechanism of action of PPIs.",Success
A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for evaluation of progressively worsening swelling around the eyes. He has no history of major medical illness. He had a sore throat and cough 2 weeks ago that resolved spontaneously. Physical examination shows moderate periorbital edema and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities bilaterally. A kidney biopsy specimen shows effacement of the podocytes on electron microscopy. Which of the following is most likely to be found on urinalysis?,C,"The correct answer is C. Fatty casts and albumin.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as periorbital edema and pitting edema of the lower extremities, suggest nephrotic syndrome. The kidney biopsy specimen showing effacement of the podocytes on electron microscopy further supports this diagnosis. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by heavy proteinuria, and the most likely finding on urinalysis would be albuminuria (excess protein in the urine).

Fatty casts are also commonly seen in nephrotic syndrome due to the presence of lipid-rich substances in the urine. Fatty casts are formed when lipids from the glomerular filtrate precipitate out in the tubules and combine with Tamm-Horsfall protein to form casts.

The other options are not directly related to nephrotic syndrome:

A. Hyaline casts and immunoglobulins are more commonly seen in chronic kidney disease or acute kidney injury.

B. Red blood cell casts and acanthocytes are indicative of glomerulonephritis or vasculitis.

D. White blood cell casts and eosinophils are typically seen in pyelonephritis or allergic interstitial nephritis.

E. Granular casts and tubular epithelial cells are more commonly seen in acute tubular necrosis or chronic kidney disease.

"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?",A,"The correct answer is C. Lead-time bias.

Lead-time bias occurs when a diagnostic test or screening method appears to improve outcomes because it detects a condition earlier, rather than actually changing the natural course of the disease. In this case, if the conclusion that initial ultrasonography is associated with better outcomes is due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point-of-care ultrasound, it would suggest that the ultrasound is simply detecting the condition earlier, rather than actually reducing the risk of complications or improving patient outcomes.

Lead-time bias is a type of bias that can occur in studies where the outcome is measured from the time of diagnosis, rather than from the time of symptom onset or disease initiation. It can lead to an overestimation of the benefits of a diagnostic test or screening method.

The other options are not directly related to this scenario:

A. Measurement bias refers to a systematic error in the measurement of a variable, which is not the case here.

B. Recall bias occurs when participants in a study have differential recall of past events or exposures, which is not relevant to this study.

D. Selection bias occurs when the selection of participants into a study is not random, leading to differences between groups, which is not the case in this randomized controlled trial.

E. Length-time bias occurs when a screening test preferentially detects slower-growing or less aggressive diseases, leading to an overestimation of the benefits of screening, which is not applicable to this study.",Success
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of intermittent chest pain and palpitations. She also complains of dyspnea on exertion and has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss in the past 2 months despite normal appetite. She has no history of serious medical illness. Cardiac examination shows an irregularly irregular rhythm and a grade 3/6, low pitched, rumbling, mid-diastolic murmur heard best over the apex. Diffuse wheezing and bilateral rales are present in the lung bases. A transthoracic echocardiogram shows a left-ventricular ejection fraction of 40% and a mass in the left atrium. A biopsy of the mass is likely to show which of the following?",E,"The correct answer is B. Clusters of bland cells without mitotic activity.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of mitral stenosis, likely due to a left atrial myxoma. The echocardiogram results, including the left-ventricular ejection fraction and the presence of a mass in the left atrium, further support this diagnosis.

A left atrial myxoma is a benign tumor that typically arises from the interatrial septum and can cause symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, and weight loss. The characteristic murmur described in the question, a grade 3/6, low-pitched, rumbling, mid-diastolic murmur heard best over the apex, is consistent with mitral stenosis.

A biopsy of the mass would likely show clusters of bland cells without mitotic activity, which is characteristic of a myxoma. Myxomas are composed of a mixture of cells, including myxoma cells, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, but they are typically benign and do not exhibit mitotic activity.

The other options are not consistent with a left atrial myxoma:

A. Nonencapsulated groups of well-differentiated skeletal muscle cells are characteristic of a rhabdomyoma, a benign tumor that typically occurs in the heart of children.

C. Mixture of cells from different germinal layers is characteristic of a teratoma, a type of germ cell tumor that can occur in various locations, including the heart.

D. Encapsulated cluster of mature fat cells is characteristic of a lipoma, a benign tumor composed of adipose tissue.

Her pulse is 88/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 144/90 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm without any signs of ischemia. Serum cardiac markers are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms are consistent with angina pectoris, which is characterized by recurrent, exertional, and relieved-by-rest chest pain. The presence of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a history of amputation (which may indicate peripheral artery disease) increase her risk for coronary artery disease. The fact that her symptoms have increased in frequency over the past few days suggests that her condition may be unstable.

Given the patient's mobility issues due to her amputation and need for crutches, a treadmill stress test may not be feasible. Therefore, a pharmacological stress test, such as a myocardial perfusion scan, is a more appropriate option. This test can evaluate the patient's myocardial perfusion and function under stress conditions, without requiring physical exertion.

Upper endoscopy (Option B) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms, as there is no indication of gastrointestinal disease. Coronary angiography (Option C) is an invasive procedure that may be necessary in the future, but it is not the next step in diagnosis. Echocardiography at rest (Option D) may not provide sufficient information about the patient's coronary artery disease, as it primarily evaluates cardiac structure and function at rest. Repeating the ECG under treadmill stress (Option E) is not feasible due to the patient's mobility issues, as mentioned earlier.

The uterus is enlarged to the umbilicus and the fetal heart rate is normal. Which of the following statements is the most accurate with respect to the presented case?",C,"The correct answer is E. Urinalysis should be performed to check for leukocytes, blood, and bacteria; if positive, perform a urine culture.

Explanation:

The patient was previously diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria and treated with amoxicillin. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), it is recommended to perform a test of cure (TOC) 1-2 weeks after completion of treatment to ensure that the infection has been cleared. This is because asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy can increase the risk of pyelonephritis and preterm labor if left untreated.

Option E is the most accurate statement because it recommends performing a urinalysis to check for signs of infection, such as leukocytes, blood, and bacteria. If the urinalysis is positive, a urine culture should be performed to confirm the presence of bacteria and guide further treatment.

Option A is incorrect because the patient should have a test of cure to ensure that the infection has been cleared, even if she is asymptomatic.

Option B is incorrect because while it is true that urine testing should be performed at each antenatal visit, it is not necessary to perform a full urine culture at each visit. A urinalysis with reflex to culture if positive is a more appropriate approach.

Option C is incorrect because while a urine culture may be necessary, it should only be performed if the urinalysis is positive.

Option D is incorrect because a urine dipstick assay for leukocyte esterase is not sufficient to rule out bacteriuria. A full urinalysis with reflex to culture if positive is a more appropriate approach.",Success

When discussing the diagnosis with the parents, which of the following is this baby at an increased risk for having?",B,"The correct answer is D. Cleft lip.

The physical examination findings described, including upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, flat facial profile, small ears, single palmar crease, and hypotonia, are consistent with Down syndrome (Trisomy 21). Down syndrome is a genetic disorder that occurs when there is an extra copy of chromosome 21.

Individuals with Down syndrome are at an increased risk for various congenital anomalies, including cleft lip and palate. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 40% of children with Down syndrome have a congenital heart defect, but Tetralogy of Fallot (Option A) is not a specific association with Down syndrome. Omphalocele (Option B) is a congenital abdominal wall defect that is not typically associated with Down syndrome. Congenital cataracts (Option C) are not a common feature of Down syndrome. Macroorchidism (Option E) is actually a characteristic of Fragile X syndrome, not Down syndrome.

Her blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg; pulse, 60/min, and body mass index is 33.5 kg/m2. The neurological examination reveals normal extraocular movements. Mild bilateral papilledema is present. A magnetic resonance imaging of the brain reveals a solitary lesion in the left temporal region with predominant hemorrhage. Refer to the image below of the MRI of the brain. Which of the following types of cancer has the highest tendency to cause this brain lesion?",C,"Based on the patient's symptoms and the MRI image, the most likely diagnosis is a brain metastasis. Given the characteristics of the lesion, I would choose option B. Lung cancer.

Here's why:

1. **Location and appearance of the lesion**: The solitary lesion in the left temporal region with predominant hemorrhage is consistent with a brain metastasis. Lung cancer is a common primary tumor that metastasizes to the brain, and the hemorrhagic component is also characteristic of lung cancer metastases.
2. **Patient's demographics**: The patient's age (52 years) and sex (female) are consistent with the demographic profile of patients with lung cancer.
3. **Lack of other symptoms**: The absence of fever, sensitivity to light or sound, and other systemic symptoms makes it less likely that the patient has a primary brain tumor or an infectious process.
4. **Papilledema**: The presence of mild bilateral papilledema suggests increased intracranial pressure, which is often seen in patients with brain metastases.

While breast cancer (option A) can also metastasize to the brain, it is less likely to present with a hemorrhagic lesion. Melanoma (option C) is a possibility, but it tends to produce multiple brain metastases rather than a solitary lesion. Multiple myeloma (option D) is unlikely to cause a solitary brain lesion, and thyroid cancer (option E) is less likely to metastasize to the brain.

According to current medical guidelines, lung cancer is one of the most common primary tumors to metastasize to the brain, and it is often associated with hemorrhagic lesions. Therefore, option B. Lung cancer is the most likely answer.",Success

She has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 10 years and is actively trying to quit smoking. A drug is prescribed that will treat the patient's mood disturbance and support smoking cessation. This patient should be counseled about which of the following possible side effects of this drug?",D,"The correct answer is D. Tachycardia.

The patient's symptoms suggest depression, and the fact that she's trying to quit smoking suggests that the prescribed drug is likely bupropion (Zyban or Wellbutrin). Bupropion is an antidepressant that is also used as a smoking cessation aid.

Tachycardia (rapid heart rate) is a common side effect of bupropion, particularly at higher doses. It's essential to counsel the patient about this potential side effect, as it can be a concern, especially for patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Decreased libido is a common side effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but it's not typically associated with bupropion.

C. Urinary retention is not a common side effect of bupropion.

E. QTc prolongation is a potential side effect of some antidepressants, but it's not a typical concern with bupropion.

It's essential to note that bupropion can have other side effects, such as headaches, insomnia, and dry mouth, which should also be discussed with the patient. However, based on the options provided, tachycardia is the most relevant side effect to counsel the patient about.",Success
"A 37-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician after returning from her honeymoon in Cancun. A few days ago, she began to notice an eruption of small red bumps that cover her torso, back, and buttocks. The patient first thought she had acne, but became worried when the rash continued to itch. The patient denies other symptoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical exam is notable for red papules and pustules scattered across the trunk, abdomen, back, and buttocks, while sparing the limbs. Closer examination indicates inflammation of the hair follicles. Culture yields motile, gram-negative rods that are non-lactose fermenting and oxidase positive. What other finding is commonly observed in the culture of the most likely organism?",B,"The correct answer is B. Blue-green pigment.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, including the eruption of small red bumps, itching, and inflammation of the hair follicles, are consistent with a diagnosis of folliculitis. The culture results, which show motile, gram-negative rods that are non-lactose fermenting and oxidase positive, suggest that the most likely organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative, motile, rod-shaped bacterium that is commonly found in water and soil. It is a frequent cause of folliculitis, particularly in individuals who have been exposed to contaminated water, such as in hot tubs or swimming pools.

One of the characteristic features of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is its ability to produce a blue-green pigment called pyocyanin. This pigment is responsible for the characteristic blue-green color of Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonies on agar plates. Therefore, option B, Blue-green pigment, is the correct answer.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Pink colonies are not a characteristic feature of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

C. Alpha-hemolysis is a characteristic of certain streptococcal species, not Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

D. Yellow sulfur granules are a characteristic feature of Actinomyces israelii, not Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

E. Red pigment is not a characteristic feature of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",Success
"A 30-year-old female presents to her primary care provider complaining of 4 days of fever, malaise, dyspnea, and productive cough and has recently developed pleuritic chest pain. Her past medical history is notable for asthma and takes albuterol as needed. She does not smoke but drinks alcohol socially. Her family history is notable for cystic fibrosis in her paternal uncle and interstitial lung disease in her paternal grandfather. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 21/min. Rales are noted in the right lower lung, and a chest radiograph demonstrates focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe. After initiating the appropriate treatment, she agrees to take part in a study assessing the immune response to lung infections. A protein is identified in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition. An amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated and a fluorescent marker is added to the sequence. This labeled sequence is subsequently added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient’s own neutrophils and macrophages and subsequently labeled with another fluorescent marker. The sequence binds strongly to this protein as evidenced by increased fluorescence in the gel. What process does this sequence typically undergo in immunocompetent individuals?",E,"The correct answer is D. VDJ recombination.

Here's why:

The protein identified in the patient's serum is likely an antibody, specifically an immunoglobulin (Ig). The amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is a key component of the antibody's antigen-binding site. The fact that it binds strongly to a protein isolated from the patient's own neutrophils and macrophages suggests that this protein is a receptor or antigen-presenting molecule on the surface of these immune cells.

VDJ recombination is the process by which immunoglobulin genes are rearranged in developing B cells to create a diverse repertoire of antibodies. This process involves the random combination of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments to create a unique antigen-binding site. This is a critical step in the development of immunocompetence, as it allows the immune system to recognize and respond to a vast array of antigens.

The other options are not directly related to the process described:

A. Affinity maturation: This is the process by which antibodies undergo somatic hypermutation and selection to increase their binding affinity for antigens. While important for immune responses, it is not directly related to the sequence binding to a protein on neutrophils and macrophages.

B. Random assortment: This is not a recognized immunological process.

C. Random nucleotide addition: This is not a specific immunological process, and nucleotide addition is not typically random in immunoglobulin gene rearrangement.

E. Isotype switching: This is the process by which B cells switch from producing one class of antibody (e.g., IgM) to another (e.g., IgG). While important for immune responses, it is not directly related to the sequence binding to a protein on neutrophils and macrophages.

In summary, the correct answer is D. VDJ recombination, as it is the process by which immunoglobulin genes are rearranged to create a diverse repertoire of antibodies, which is critical for immunocompetence.",Success
"A 27-year-old graduate student is bitten by a coral snake while he was hiking alone through the woods and dies 2 hours later from respiratory failure. His body was discovered 7 hours later by a group of campers who promptly called the police. On arrival, the police found his body to be cold and stiff. Which of the following processes is responsible for the rigidity observed?",D,"The correct answer is D. Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling.

Rigidity, also known as rigor mortis, is a post-mortem phenomenon characterized by the stiffening of the body's muscles. It occurs due to the depletion of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) in the muscles, which is necessary for muscle relaxation.

When the student died from respiratory failure, his body's ATP stores were depleted, leading to the inhibition of cross-bridge cycling. Cross-bridge cycling is the process by which myosin heads bind to actin filaments, causing muscle contraction. Without ATP, the myosin heads remain bound to the actin filaments, resulting in muscle stiffness.

Option A is incorrect because neurotoxins, such as those found in coral snake venom, can cause muscle weakness or paralysis, but they do not directly contribute to rigor mortis.

Option B is also incorrect because a reduced affinity of myosin head for actin filament would lead to muscle relaxation, not stiffness.

Option C is partially correct, as low temperatures can contribute to the onset of rigor mortis by slowing down the metabolism and ATP depletion. However, it is not the primary cause of rigidity in this scenario.

Option E is incorrect because intracellular calcium levels do not directly affect rigor mortis. Calcium is involved in muscle contraction, but its depletion does not cause muscle stiffness.

It's worth noting that rigor mortis typically develops within 1-2 hours after death, peaks around 12 hours, and resolves within 24-48 hours. In this scenario, the student's body was discovered 7 hours after death, which is consistent with the expected timing of rigor mortis.",Success
"A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 12 weeks estimated gestational age presents with malaise, joint pain, fever, and chills for the past 3 days. Physical examination reveals a mild lace-like rash and arthritis. The patient mentions her friend who is a medical student told her that her symptoms are suggestive of a parvovirus B19 infection which may adversely affect her baby. Which of the following statements regarding the effect of parvovirus B19 infection in this pregnant patient is correct?",A,"The correct answer is A. It can lead to hydrops fetalis secondary to fetal anemia.

Parvovirus B19 infection, also known as fifth disease, can cause significant morbidity in pregnant women, particularly in the first trimester. The virus can cross the placenta and infect the fetus, leading to fetal anemia, which can result in hydrops fetalis. Hydrops fetalis is a condition characterized by abnormal accumulation of fluid in the fetus, which can be life-threatening.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

B. Aplastic crisis is a complication of parvovirus B19 infection in individuals with pre-existing hemolytic disorders, such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia. It is not a direct consequence of congenital infection.

C. Physical malformations are not frequently associated with congenital parvovirus B19 infection. The virus is not teratogenic, and the risk of birth defects is not increased.

D. Fetal loss occurs in approximately 2-6% of primary infections, not more than 40%. The risk of fetal loss is highest during the first 20 weeks of gestation.

E. The neonate is not typically born with a slapped-cheek rash, which is a characteristic feature of parvovirus B19 infection in children. The rash usually develops after birth, often 1-3 weeks after infection.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy can lead to fetal anemia and hydrops fetalis, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",Success
"A 52-year-old man with hypertension and hyperlipidemia comes to the emergency department 30 minutes after the sudden onset of substernal chest pain while sitting in a chair at home. He reports drinking 2 glasses of whiskey earlier that day, after a stressful day at work. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. His pulse is 102/min, and blood pressure is 135/88 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows normal heart sounds. An ECG obtained on arrival at the emergency department shows ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads. 15 minutes later, the patient's chest pain has resolved and a repeat ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s chest pain?",A,"The correct answer is A. Coronary artery vasospasm.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of coronary artery vasospasm, also known as Prinzmetal's angina. The key features that support this diagnosis are:

1. Sudden onset of substernal chest pain: Vasospasm can cause sudden, severe chest pain.
2. Resolution of pain with repeat ECG showing no abnormalities: Vasospasm is a transient event, and the pain typically resolves once the spasm resolves.
3. ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads on the initial ECG: Vasospasm can cause ST-segment elevations, which are a hallmark of transmural ischemia.
4. Lack of ongoing ischemic symptoms or ECG changes after the initial event: This suggests that the event was not due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture or ongoing ischemia.
5. History of smoking and hypertension: Both of these factors can contribute to coronary artery vasospasm.

Coronary artery vasodilation (Option B) is not a plausible explanation for the patient's symptoms, as it would not cause chest pain or ST-segment elevations.

Atherosclerotic coronary artery narrowing (Option C) or atherosclerotic plaque rupture (Option D) could cause chest pain, but the transient nature of the event and the resolution of symptoms with a repeat ECG make these options less likely.

Pericardial inflammation (Option E) is not supported by the patient's symptoms or ECG findings, and would typically present with different ECG changes, such as diffuse ST-segment elevations or PR-segment depression.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of whiskey consumption may have contributed to the vasospasm, as alcohol can cause coronary artery vasodilation, which can then lead to vasospasm in susceptible individuals.",Success
"A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of a sudden loss of consciousness. He has asthma and has been hospitalized multiple times. His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is somnolent and diaphoretic. Serum studies show a glucose concentration of 22 mg/dL and a potassium concentration of 2.4 mEq/L. A dextrose infusion is administered, after which his glucose concentration normalizes and his symptoms improve. He is admitted to the hospital for further observation. Overnight, he has another episode of decreased consciousness. Serum studies taken during the episode show a glucose concentration of 19 mg/dL, an insulin concentration of 108 mIU/L (N=2.6–24.9), and a C-peptide concentration of 0.3 ng/mL (N = 0.8–3.1). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Factitious disorder imposed on another.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as sudden loss of consciousness, somnolence, and diaphoresis, are consistent with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). The laboratory results support this diagnosis, with a low glucose concentration and an inappropriately high insulin concentration. The C-peptide concentration is low, which suggests that the high insulin level is not due to endogenous insulin production.

The key to this diagnosis is the fact that the patient's mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. This raises the suspicion that the mother may be administering insulin to the child, causing the hypoglycemic episodes. Factitious disorder imposed on another, also known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy, is a condition in which a caregiver fabricates or induces illness in a child to gain attention and sympathy for themselves.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:

A. Malingering: This is a condition in which an individual fabricates or exaggerates symptoms for personal gain, but it is not applicable in this scenario since the patient is a 5-year-old child.

B. Glucagonoma: This is a rare pancreatic tumor that causes hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), not hypoglycemia.

C. Primary adrenal insufficiency: This is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol, which can cause hypoglycemia. However, the laboratory results do not support this diagnosis, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with insulin-induced hypoglycemia.

D. Conversion disorder: This is a psychological disorder in which emotional distress is converted into physical symptoms. While the patient's symptoms may have a psychological component, the laboratory results suggest a underlying medical condition, specifically hypoglycemia.

In summary, the most likely diagnosis is factitious disorder imposed on another, with the mother administering insulin to the child to induce hypoglycemic episodes.",Success

The medical history is significant for arterial hypertension and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus for 8 years, and depression for 3 years. She is prescribed amlodipine, valsartan, atorvastatin, metformin, and amitriptyline. Her weight is 75 kg (165 lb) and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 40 in). Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 120/80 mm Hg; heart rate, 91/min; respiratory rate, 13/min; and temperature, 36.4℃ (97.5℉). The physical examination reveals lower abdominal tenderness with a distended urinary bladder that is palpated in the suprapubic region. The neurological examination shows decreased Achilles reflexes bilaterally, and diminished fine touch and vibratory sensation. On gynecologic examination, the cervix was normally positioned, mobile, and without any visible lesions. Bulging of the posterior vaginal wall was noted. The adnexa were not palpable. An ultrasound examination showed an overdistended urinary bladder with no structural abnormalities. Which of the following is  the next step in managing this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Bladder catheterization.

The patient presents with urinary retention, which is a medical emergency that requires prompt intervention. The symptoms of urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating, incomplete voiding, and dull pain in the suprapubic region, along with the physical examination findings of a distended urinary bladder and lower abdominal tenderness, suggest urinary retention. The ultrasound examination confirms the diagnosis by showing an overdistended urinary bladder with no structural abnormalities.

Bladder catheterization is the next step in managing this patient to relieve the urinary retention and prevent further complications such as urinary tract infections, kidney damage, or sepsis. Catheterization will also help to drain the bladder and alleviate the patient's symptoms.

The other options are not the next step in managing this patient:

A. Installing a vaginal pessary is a treatment for pelvic organ prolapse, which is not the primary concern in this patient.

C. Cystostomy is a surgical procedure that creates a urinary diversion, which is not necessary in this patient at this time.

D. Prescribing bethanechol is a treatment for urinary retention due to neurogenic bladder, but it is not the first step in managing this patient.

E. Prescribing prostaglandin E2 is not relevant to the management of urinary retention.

"A 69-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with hip and back pain. The patient states that this weekend he had a barbecue. When he was lifting a heavy object he suddenly felt pain in his lower back. He describes the pain as in his buttocks but states that at times it travels down his leg. The patient states that it feels, ""electrical."" The patient has a past medical history of obesity, diabetes, depression, anxiety, diverticulosis, constipation, and a surgical repair of his anterior cruciate ligament. His current medications include metformin, insulin, lisinopril, fluoxetine, and sodium docusate. Which of the following is most likely to help confirm the diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Straight leg raise.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the ""electrical"" pain traveling down his leg, suggest a possible diagnosis of sciatica, which is compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve. The sciatic nerve runs from the lower back down to the legs, and compression or irritation can cause pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the lower back, buttocks, or legs.

The straight leg raise test is a common diagnostic tool used to assess for sciatica. During the test, the patient lies on their back, and the healthcare provider slowly lifts the patient's leg while keeping it straight. If the patient experiences pain or discomfort in their lower back or leg, it can indicate compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve.

Here's why the other options are not the best choice:

A. Palpating the paraspinus muscle may help identify muscle tenderness or spasm, but it is not specific to sciatica.

B. Flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the thigh (FABER test) is used to assess for hip joint pathology, such as hip osteoarthritis or labral tears, which is not the primary concern in this patient's presentation.

D. Internal rotation of the extended hip is also used to assess for hip joint pathology, but it is not specific to sciatica.

E. Radiography (X-ray) may be useful in ruling out other conditions, such as fractures or osteoarthritis, but it is not a diagnostic test for sciatica. In fact, imaging studies are often not necessary for the diagnosis of sciatica, and the American College of Physicians recommends against routine imaging for patients with acute low back pain.

It's worth noting that the patient's past medical history and medications do not seem to be directly related to the current symptoms, but it's always important to consider the patient's overall health and potential comorbidities when making a diagnosis.",Success

Hb% 10 gm/dL
Total count (WBC) 11,000 /mm3
Differential count:
Neutrophile 70%
Lymphocytes 25%
Monocytes 5%
ESR 10 mm/hr
What is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Plummer-Vinson syndrome.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including fatigue, neck pain, difficulty swallowing, and unintentional weight loss, suggest an underlying condition affecting the esophagus. The presence of an upper esophageal web on the upper barium esophagram is a key finding. Plummer-Vinson syndrome is a condition characterized by the presence of an esophageal web, typically in the upper esophagus, which can cause dysphagia and weight loss.

The patient's laboratory results, including a low hemoglobin level (10 gm/dL) and mild conjunctival pallor, suggest anemia, which is a common finding in Plummer-Vinson syndrome. The normal white blood cell count and differential count, as well as the normal ESR, do not suggest an underlying inflammatory or malignant process.

While esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (option B) can cause dysphagia and weight loss, it is less likely in this case due to the presence of an esophageal web, which is not typically seen in esophageal cancer. Zenker's diverticulum (option C) is a pouch-like structure in the esophagus that can cause dysphagia, but it is not typically associated with anemia or weight loss. Scleroderma (option D) is a systemic autoimmune disease that can cause esophageal dysmotility and dysphagia, but it is not typically associated with esophageal webs. Achalasia (option E) is a motility disorder that can cause dysphagia, but it is not typically associated with esophageal webs or anemia.

Plummer-Vinson syndrome is a rare condition, but it is a well-known cause of esophageal webs and dysphagia, especially in postmenopausal women.",Success
"A 65-year-old female patient comes to the physician’s office for her annual check-up. The patient’s only complaint is that she feels her vision has been getting more blurry over the past year. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes diagnosed 20 years ago and osteoarthritis. Her medications include metformin, glimepiride, and ibuprofen as needed for pain. Fundoscopic examination of this patient reveals narrowing of retinal arteries and microaneurysms. This patient’s symptoms are likely caused by tissue specific differences in expression of which of the following enzymes?",B,"The correct answer is A. Aldose reductase.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the blurry vision, and the fundoscopic examination findings of narrowing of retinal arteries and microaneurysms, are consistent with diabetic retinopathy, a common complication of diabetes.

Aldose reductase is an enzyme involved in the polyol pathway, which is responsible for converting glucose to sorbitol. In diabetic patients, the increased glucose levels can lead to an accumulation of sorbitol in certain tissues, including the retina. This can cause damage to the retinal cells and blood vessels, leading to diabetic retinopathy.

Tissue-specific differences in the expression of aldose reductase are thought to contribute to the development of diabetic retinopathy. The retina has high levels of aldose reductase, making it more susceptible to the damaging effects of sorbitol accumulation.

The other options are not directly related to diabetic retinopathy or the patient's symptoms:

* Sorbitol dehydrogenase (B) is an enzyme involved in the polyol pathway, but it is not directly related to diabetic retinopathy.
* Galactocerebrosidase (C) is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of galactolipids and is related to Krabbe disease, a lysosomal storage disorder.
* Arylsulfatase A (D) is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of sulfated glycolipids and is related to metachromatic leukodystrophy, a lysosomal storage disorder.
* Sphingomyelinase (E) is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of sphingomyelin and is related to Niemann-Pick disease, a lysosomal storage disorder.

The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Chronic granulomatous disease.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). The key features that support this diagnosis are:

1. Recurrent skin lesions: The patient has had multiple episodes of skin lesions, which are a common feature of CGD.
2. Recurrent respiratory tract infections: CGD patients are prone to recurrent infections, particularly in the lungs.
3. Enlarged lymph nodes: The patient has bilateral cervical and axillary lymph node enlargement, which is consistent with CGD.
4. Recurrent fevers: The patient has had multiple episodes of fever, which is a common feature of CGD.
5. Failure to thrive: The patient is at the 5th percentile for length and 10th percentile for weight, indicating growth retardation, which is a common complication of CGD.

CGD is a rare genetic disorder that affects the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in phagocytic cells, leading to impaired bacterial killing and recurrent infections. The disease typically presents in early childhood, and the skin lesions are often a prominent feature.

The other options are less likely:

B. Ataxia-telangiectasia: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and immune system. While it can present with recurrent infections, the skin lesions and lymph node enlargement are not typical features.

"A 53-year-old man presents to clinic with a six month history of shoulder pain that is especially bothersome at night. Over the weekend he ""strained his shoulder"" during a pick-up basketball game and reports an acute exacerbation of his pain symptoms. On exam, he complains of pain to palpation just below the acromion. You suspect he has torn his supraspinatus. If correct, which of these functional maneuvers would you expect to be deficient on physical exam?",C,"The correct answer is C. Initiation of abduction.

The supraspinatus muscle is one of the rotator cuff muscles, and its primary function is to assist in the initiation of abduction (lifting the arm out to the side) of the shoulder joint. Specifically, it helps to stabilize the humeral head in the glenoid cavity and facilitates the initial 15-20 degrees of abduction.

If the supraspinatus muscle is torn, the patient would likely experience weakness or deficiency in initiating abduction, making it difficult to lift their arm out to the side. This is because the supraspinatus muscle plays a crucial role in stabilizing the shoulder joint and assisting in the initial phase of abduction.

The other options are not directly related to the function of the supraspinatus muscle:

A. Initiation of adduction (bringing the arm towards the body) is primarily controlled by the pectoralis major muscle.

B. External rotation (rotating the arm outward) is primarily controlled by the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles.

D. Completion of abduction (finishing the movement of lifting the arm out to the side) is primarily controlled by the deltoid muscle.

E. Internal rotation (rotating the arm inward) is primarily controlled by the subscapularis, latissimus dorsi, and teres major muscles.

Therefore, if the patient has a torn supraspinatus muscle, you would expect them to have difficulty initiating abduction, making option C the correct answer.",Success

Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 114/68 mm Hg. Examination of the left knee shows tenderness on palpation of the anteromedial joint line; there is crepitus and pain with full flexion and extension. Serum uric acid concentration is 8.0 mg/dL and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 15 mm/h. Which of the following is the most likely finding on imaging of the left knee?",A,"The correct answer is A. Osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as knee pain, stiffness, and limited mobility, are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA). The physical examination findings of tenderness on palpation of the anteromedial joint line, crepitus, and pain with full flexion and extension also support this diagnosis.

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of articular cartilage, leading to bone-on-bone contact and subsequent bone remodeling. Radiographic features of OA typically include:

* Osteophytes (bony spurs)
* Joint-space narrowing
* Subchondral sclerosis (increased bone density)

Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely imaging finding on x-ray would be osteophytes with joint-space narrowing, which is consistent with OA.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

B. Calcification of synovia and cartilage on ultrasound is more consistent with pseudogout or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) deposition disease, which is a different condition.

C. Diffuse lytic-sclerotic bone lesions on x-ray are more consistent with a malignant process, such as metastatic breast cancer, which is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

D. Joint effusion and pannus on ultrasound are more consistent with inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

E. Fluid-filled pouch on ultrasound is more consistent with a Baker's cyst, which is a fluid-filled sac that forms behind the knee. While it's possible that the patient may have a Baker's cyst, it's not the most likely finding given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and medical history, the most likely imaging finding on x-ray is osteophytes with joint-space narrowing, consistent with osteoarthritis.",Success

Study of the boy’s neutrophils reveals that they contain large cytoplasmic vacuoles. Genetic studies show a mutation in the LYST gene. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?,C,"The correct answer is C. Chediak-Higashi syndrome.

Here's why:

* The patient's presentation with recurrent bacterial infections since birth suggests an immunodeficiency disorder.
* The physical examination findings of light-colored skin with silver-colored hair are characteristic of Chediak-Higashi syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder.
* The presence of large cytoplasmic vacuoles in neutrophils is a hallmark feature of Chediak-Higashi syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator) gene.
* Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by impaired lysosomal function, leading to defective phagocytosis and recurrent infections.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

* A. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is an acquired condition, typically caused by HIV infection, which is unlikely in a 6-month-old boy with a congenital presentation.
* B. Common variable immunodeficiency is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by impaired antibody production, but it does not typically present with the distinctive physical examination findings or neutrophil abnormalities seen in this patient.
* D. Congenital thymic aplasia, also known as DiGeorge syndrome, is a developmental disorder characterized by thymic hypoplasia, but it does not typically present with the same physical examination findings or neutrophil abnormalities as Chediak-Higashi syndrome.
* E. Leukocyte adhesion deficiency–1 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired leukocyte adhesion and migration, but it does not typically present with the same physical examination findings or neutrophil abnormalities as Chediak-Higashi syndrome.

Based on his radiography, he is diagnosed with osteomyelitis and admitted to the hospital for partial amputation of his right foot. He is given appropriate prophylaxis for tetanus and discharged 5 hospital days later on antibiotics. He returns to the emergency department one week later with difficulty breathing. His temperature is 98°F (37°C), blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, respirations are 27/min, and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. His amputated foot stump is erythematous and edematous but not tender to palpation. An electrocardiogram reveals sinus tachycardia. He requests something to help calm his breathing down. What is the next best step in management?",B,"The correct answer is C. D-dimer and lower extremity Doppler ultrasound.

The patient's symptoms of difficulty breathing, tachycardia, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air suggest a possible diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's recent hospitalization and surgery (partial amputation of the right foot) increase his risk for developing a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to PE.

Given the patient's symptoms and risk factors, the next best step in management is to evaluate for DVT and PE. A D-dimer test is a sensitive screening test for DVT and PE, and a lower extremity Doppler ultrasound can help diagnose DVT. If the D-dimer test is positive, further imaging such as a CT pulmonary angiogram may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PE.

Option A is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and is not a priority at this time. Option B may be considered if the D-dimer test is positive, but it is not the next best step. Option D is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and is not a priority at this time. Option E is not a relevant test for evaluating the patient's symptoms, and oxycodone is not an appropriate medication to manage dyspnea in this scenario.

It's essential to prioritize the evaluation and management of the patient's respiratory symptoms, as PE can be a life-threatening condition if not promptly diagnosed and treated.",Success
"A 56-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-day history of sudden severe pain in his right great toe. Four months ago, he had an episode of severe joint pain involving his left knee that lasted several days and resolved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has a history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide and nephrolithiasis. Examination shows erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the right metatarsophalangeal joint; range of movement is limited by pain. His serum uric acid is 12 mg/dL. Arthrocentesis yields cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 18,500/mm3 (80% segmented neutrophils). Polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid is shown. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of acute gouty arthritis. The polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid shows negatively birefringent crystals, which are characteristic of monosodium urate crystals, further supporting the diagnosis of gout.

Given the patient's history of recurrent gouty attacks, long-term pharmacotherapy is necessary to prevent future episodes. The most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient is allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. Allopurinol works by inhibiting the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which is involved in the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine and then to uric acid. By inhibiting xanthine oxidase, allopurinol reduces the production of uric acid, thereby decreasing the risk of future gouty attacks.

The other options are not correct:

A. Increased conversion of uric acid to allantoin is the mechanism of action of rasburicase, a uricase enzyme that is used to treat tumor lysis syndrome, not gout.

B. Inhibition of phospholipase A is the mechanism of action of corticosteroids, which may be used to treat acute gouty attacks, but are not a long-term pharmacotherapy for gout.

D. Increased renal excretion of urate is the mechanism of action of uricosuric agents such as probenecid, which may be used to treat gout, but are not the most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient.

E. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase is the mechanism of action of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which may be used to treat acute gouty attacks, but are not a long-term pharmacotherapy for gout.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe dyspnea, wheezing, and palpitations. His symptoms began approx. 20 minutes after being stung by a bee on the left arm. Past medical history is significant for hypertension for which he takes labetalol. While being questioned, the patient becomes obtunded. His vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F); blood pressure 85/55 mm Hg; pulse 110/min; respiratory rate 31/min; and oxygen saturation 90% on room air. On physical examination, an area of severe edema and erythema is noted on the extensor surface of the left forearm, and there is severe angioedema of the face and neck. The patient is intubated, and aggressive fluid resuscitation and intramuscular epinephrine are administered. A repeat blood pressure is 90/55 mm Hg, despite these efforts. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is E. Administer norepinephrine.

This patient is experiencing a severe anaphylactic reaction, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. The patient's symptoms, including dyspnea, wheezing, palpitations, and angioedema, are consistent with anaphylaxis. The patient's hypotension (blood pressure 85/55 mm Hg) and obtundation indicate that the reaction is severe and potentially fatal.

The patient has already been intubated and received aggressive fluid resuscitation and intramuscular epinephrine, which are appropriate initial steps in the management of anaphylaxis. However, despite these efforts, the patient's blood pressure remains low (90/55 mm Hg).

In this scenario, the next best step is to administer norepinephrine, a vasopressor that can help increase blood pressure and perfusion to vital organs. Norepinephrine is often used in anaphylaxis to treat refractory hypotension, as it has both alpha-1 and beta-1 adrenergic effects, which can help increase peripheral vascular resistance and cardiac output.

The other options are not the next best step in this scenario:

A. Dopamine is not typically used in anaphylaxis, and its effects may be unpredictable in this setting.

B. Glucagon may be used in anaphylaxis caused by beta-blocker overdose, but it is not the best choice in this scenario, as the patient's hypotension is likely due to anaphylaxis rather than beta-blockade.

C. Dexamethasone is often used in anaphylaxis to reduce the risk of biphasic reactions, but it is not the next best step in this scenario, as the patient's hypotension needs to be addressed first.

D. Diphenhydramine and ranitidine are used to treat allergic reactions, but they are not effective in treating anaphylactic shock.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of hypertension and use of labetalol may have contributed to the severity of the anaphylactic reaction, as beta-blockers can exacerbate anaphylaxis by blocking the effects of epinephrine.",Success
"A 74-year-old man has been treated for prostate cancer for the past 6 months. He is on an experimental drug (drug X) that is used to reduce the action of testosterone by blocking the androgen receptor. Since the initiation of therapy, the growth of the cancerous tissue has slowed. This medication is known to be excreted by the kidneys at the current dose that he is taking. The patient has no significant complaints, except for excessive sweating at times. On physical examination, a small area of tissue around his nipples is enlarged bilaterally. No other abnormal findings are present. Which of the following drugs most likely belongs to be the same class as drug X?",C,"The correct answer is C. Flutamide.

Here's why:

The patient is taking an experimental drug (drug X) that blocks the androgen receptor, which reduces the action of testosterone. This suggests that drug X is an anti-androgen. The patient's symptoms, such as excessive sweating and bilateral nipple tissue enlargement (gynecomastia), are consistent with anti-androgen therapy.

Flutamide is an anti-androgen medication that works by blocking the androgen receptor, similar to drug X. It is commonly used to treat prostate cancer, which aligns with the patient's diagnosis.

Let's rule out the other options:

A. Leuprolide is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, which reduces testosterone production by the testes. While it's used to treat prostate cancer, its mechanism of action is different from drug X.

B. Finasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, which reduces the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It's used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and male pattern baldness, but it's not an anti-androgen.

D. Terazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker, used to treat BPH and hypertension. It doesn't have anti-androgen properties.

E. Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor, which reduces the conversion of androgens to estrogens. While it's used to treat breast cancer, it's not an anti-androgen.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the mechanism of action of drug X, flutamide (option C) is the most likely drug to belong to the same class as drug X.",Success
"A 74-year-old man was admitted to the hospital after falling down several stairs. He is a known alcoholic. He was started on IV fluids and received a head CT, which was negative. It was decided that he would be watched for one day before being discharged, after a negative work-up. Suddenly, he is unable to move his arms and legs in addition to experiencing difficulty chewing, swallowing, moving his face, and speaking. Which of the following electrolyte imbalances was most likely corrected too aggressively?",A,"The correct answer is A. Hyponatremia.

The patient's symptoms, including weakness or paralysis of the arms and legs, difficulty chewing, swallowing, moving the face, and speaking, are consistent with central pontine myelinolysis (CPM), a rare but serious complication of rapid correction of hyponatremia.

CPM occurs when there is a rapid change in serum sodium levels, typically in patients with chronic hyponatremia, such as those with alcoholism. When sodium levels are rapidly corrected, water shifts out of the brain cells, leading to demyelination of the neurons in the pons and other areas of the brain.

In this scenario, it is likely that the patient's hyponatremia was corrected too aggressively with IV fluids, leading to the development of CPM. The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and are less likely to be the cause of his condition.

It's worth noting that the American Heart Association and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine recommend correcting hyponatremia slowly, with a goal of increasing serum sodium by no more than 6-8 mmol/L in the first 24 hours, to minimize the risk of CPM.",Success
"A previously healthy 67-year-old man comes to the physician for routine health maintenance evaluation. He works at a community center and volunteers at a local homeless shelter. A tuberculin skin test shows an induration of 14 mm. An x-ray of the chest is normal. Treatment with an antimycobacterial drug is initiated. Two months later, he has numbness and burning over both feet and an unsteady gait. Physical examination shows decreased sensation to light touch extending from the soles of the feet to the mid-shin bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s current symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is C. Segmental demyelination of peripheral axons.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including numbness and burning over both feet and an unsteady gait, are consistent with peripheral neuropathy. The physical examination findings of decreased sensation to light touch extending from the soles of the feet to the mid-shin bilaterally further support this diagnosis.

The patient was recently started on antimycobacterial treatment, which is likely isoniazid (INH) for latent tuberculosis infection. INH is known to cause peripheral neuropathy as a side effect, particularly in older adults. This is due to INH's ability to inhibit the enzyme pyridoxal kinase, leading to a deficiency of pyridoxal phosphate, a co-factor for various enzymes involved in neurotransmitter synthesis.

The resulting peripheral neuropathy is characterized by segmental demyelination of peripheral axons, which is the correct answer. This is a common adverse effect of INH therapy, and it is reversible with supplementation of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine).

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the side effects of INH therapy:

A. Accumulation of S-adenosylmethionine is not a known cause of peripheral neuropathy.

B. Intracellular accumulation of sorbitol is related to diabetic neuropathy, not a side effect of INH therapy.

D. Impaired breakdown of glucose to ATP is related to diabetic neuropathy, not a side effect of INH therapy.

E. Degeneration of the dorsal columns is related to vitamin B12 deficiency or other conditions affecting the spinal cord, not a side effect of INH therapy.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Segmental demyelination of peripheral axons.",Success
"A 64-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with a complaint of bilateral knee pain that has been present for the past several years but has worsened recently. He reports pain with climbing stairs and with extended walks of greater than 100 yards. The pain worsens with activity throughout the day and is alleviated by periods of rest. He states that he has minimal morning stiffness, lasting approximately 5-10 minutes after waking up most days. Physical examination reveals tenderness to palpation of the bony structures on the medial aspect of the bilateral knees as well as crepitus and a decreased range of motion, limited at the extremes of flexion and extension. Both knee joints are cool to touch and exhibit bony enlargement upon palpation of the medial joint line. Which of the following studies would be indicated for further work-up of this patient's presenting condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. No further work-up needed.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knees. The presence of bilateral knee pain, worsening with activity and alleviated by rest, is a classic presentation of OA. The physical examination findings of tenderness to palpation of the bony structures, crepitus, and decreased range of motion are also consistent with OA.

In this case, further laboratory or imaging studies are not necessary to establish the diagnosis. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for the diagnosis of OA do not recommend routine laboratory tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), or rheumatoid factor (RF), as they are not diagnostic for OA.

Imaging studies, such as an MRI, may be useful in certain situations, such as to evaluate for other conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms or to assess the severity of OA. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with OA, and an MRI is not necessary to establish the diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is E. No further work-up needed. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are sufficient to establish a diagnosis of OA, and treatment can be initiated based on these findings.",Success

A peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?""",A,"The correct answer is E. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with TTP, a rare blood disorder characterized by the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body. The key features that support this diagnosis are:

1. **Pallor and rash**: The patient's pallor and rash are indicative of anemia and thrombocytopenia, which are hallmarks of TTP.
2. **Schistocytes on peripheral blood smear**: Schistocytes are fragmented red blood cells that are a characteristic feature of TTP, resulting from the mechanical damage caused by blood clots in small vessels.
3. **Thrombocytopenia**: The patient's platelet count is 49,000/mm3, which is significantly low, indicating thrombocytopenia.
4. **Anemia**: The patient's hemoglobin level is 8 g/dL, indicating anemia.
5. **Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level**: LDH is an enzyme that is released from damaged red blood cells. The elevated level of 300 U/L suggests hemolysis, which is consistent with TTP.
6. **Renal impairment**: The patient's serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal impairment, which is a common complication of TTP.
7. **History of diarrhea and vomiting**: The patient's recent history of diarrhea and vomiting may have triggered the episode of TTP.

The other options are less likely:

A. Escherichia coli infection: While E. coli can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which shares some similarities with TTP, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are more consistent with TTP.

B. Parvovirus B19 infection: Parvovirus B19 can cause anemia and thrombocytopenia, but it is not typically associated with schistocytes, renal impairment, or the other features seen in this patient.

C. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): DIC is a condition characterized by widespread clotting in small blood vessels, but it is typically associated with a more severe clinical presentation, including shock, organ failure, and a more pronounced coagulopathy.

D. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP): ITP is a condition characterized by immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, but it is not typically associated with anemia, schistocytes, or renal impairment.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are most consistent with TTP, making it the most likely underlying cause of these findings.",Success
"A 76-year-old man presents to the physician because of dyspepsia and weight loss over the past 6 months. He has no history of any serious illnesses and takes no medications. A diagnostic workup including endoscopy and biopsy shows gastric adenocarcinoma. Before further workup and staging, the biopsy results are discussed with the patient. He refuses any type of life-prolonging treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery, but he requests appropriate palliative care without any significant burden of healthcare costs. Regarding this patient’s eligibility for hospice care, what is the most appropriate next step?",B,"The correct answer is B. Determining patient's life-expectancy without treatment.

To be eligible for hospice care, a patient must have a terminal illness with a limited life expectancy, typically six months or less if the illness runs its normal course. In this scenario, the patient has been diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma and has refused life-prolonging treatment. However, the patient's life expectancy without treatment needs to be determined to establish eligibility for hospice care.

The Medicare Hospice Benefit, which is often used as a model for hospice care, requires that a physician certify that the patient has a terminal illness with a life expectancy of six months or less. This determination is typically made by the patient's physician, who takes into account the patient's diagnosis, prognosis, and current condition.

Option A is incorrect because the patient has already refused life-extending treatment. Option C is also incorrect because the presence of metastasis is not the sole determining factor for hospice eligibility. Option D is incorrect because waiting for significant cognitive or functional disability to develop may delay the patient's access to hospice care. Option E is incorrect because the patient's refusal of life-prolonging treatment does not automatically qualify them for hospice care; their life expectancy without treatment still needs to be determined.

By determining the patient's life expectancy without treatment, the healthcare team can assess the patient's eligibility for hospice care and provide appropriate support and services to improve their quality of life.",Success

These cells have lymphoid origin.

The image provided shows an increase in eosinophils, which are a type of white blood cell. Eosinophils have a bilobed nucleus and characteristic eosinophilic granules in their cytoplasm.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Eosinophils do not transform into macrophages. Macrophages are a type of white blood cell that matures from monocytes, whereas eosinophils mature from eosinophil precursors in the bone marrow.

B. Eosinophils are not responsible for producing antibodies. Antibody production is a function of B cells, a type of lymphocyte.

C. Eosinophils do not typically express CD25 on their surface. CD25 is a marker for activated T cells, particularly regulatory T cells.

D. Eosinophils normally constitute 1-3% of the total leukocyte count, not 25-40%.

Eosinophils do have a lymphoid origin, as they develop from lymphoid stem cells in the bone marrow. They play a crucial role in parasitic infections, allergic reactions, and inflammatory responses.",Success

On physical exam, you note a young woman who appears to be in pain. Cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. Abdominal exam is notable for right lower quadrant pain that is reproducible when the left lower quadrant is palpated. The patient is given morphine. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. ß-hCG.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, particularly the right lower quadrant pain that is reproducible when the left lower quadrant is palpated, are concerning for appendicitis. However, before proceeding with imaging studies, it's essential to rule out pregnancy as a potential cause of the patient's symptoms. ß-hCG (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin) is a hormone produced during pregnancy, and a positive result would significantly alter the management approach.

The American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) recommends that all women of childbearing age with abdominal pain, including those suspected of having appendicitis, undergo a pregnancy test to rule out ectopic pregnancy or other pregnancy-related complications.

While the other options may be relevant in the evaluation of the patient's symptoms, they are not the next best step in management at this point. Here's why:

A. Abdominal radiograph (x-ray) is not a sensitive or specific test for appendicitis and is not recommended as an initial imaging study.

C. CT scan may be useful in evaluating the patient's symptoms, but it should be preceded by an ultrasound (option E) in a young woman to minimize radiation exposure.

D. Stool occult blood is not a relevant test in this scenario, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with an acute abdomen rather than gastrointestinal bleeding.

E. Ultrasound is a reasonable next step, but only after ruling out pregnancy with a ß-hCG test. Ultrasound can help evaluate for appendicitis, as well as other potential causes of right lower quadrant pain, such as ovarian pathology.",Success

Creatinine 0.9 mg/dL (80 µmol/L)
Which of the following factors is a risk factor for this patient’s condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. History in the previous pregnancy.

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, the likely diagnosis is HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets) syndrome, a severe complication of preeclampsia. The patient's history of similar complaints in her previous pregnancy, which ended in a stillbirth, is a significant risk factor for developing HELLP syndrome in this pregnancy.

HELLP syndrome is a multifactorial disorder, and previous history of preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome is a strong predictor of recurrence. The patient's family history of preeclampsia in her sister also increases her risk, but it is not as strong a predictor as her personal history of preeclampsia.

The other options are not directly related to the development of HELLP syndrome:

A. The patient's age is not a significant risk factor for HELLP syndrome.

B. While some studies suggest that Asian women may be at lower risk for preeclampsia, this is not a significant risk factor for HELLP syndrome.

C. Nulliparity is a risk factor for preeclampsia, but not specifically for HELLP syndrome.

E. While a family history of preeclampsia is a risk factor, it is not as strong a predictor as the patient's personal history of preeclampsia.

"A 44-year-old obese African-American male presents to clinic with complaints of 3 days of fatigue and dark urine. He has had several similar episodes since birth, all of which resolved spontaneously. He has a 5-year history of poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus and was started on glipizide one week ago. Prior to the episode, he felt well without any upper respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. He predominantly eats fast food, although he tried a new Lebanese restaurant about one month ago. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Medication.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, specifically fatigue and dark urine, are consistent with a hemolytic crisis, which is a common complication of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. G6PD deficiency is an X-linked recessive disorder that affects approximately 12% of African-American males.

The recent introduction of glipizide, a sulfonylurea medication, is the most likely trigger for this episode. Sulfonylureas are known to precipitate hemolytic crises in individuals with G6PD deficiency. The patient's history of similar episodes since birth, which resolved spontaneously, suggests an underlying condition that is exacerbated by certain triggers.

While viral or bacterial infections (options A and B) could cause fatigue and dark urine, the patient's lack of upper respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms makes these options less likely. The new Lebanese food (option C) is an unlikely cause, as there is no specific ingredient or food group that is known to trigger hemolytic crises in individuals with G6PD deficiency. Idiopathic (option E) is not a likely cause, as the patient's symptoms are consistent with a known medical condition.

It's essential to note that G6PD deficiency is often underdiagnosed, and healthcare providers should consider this condition in patients with a history of recurrent hemolytic episodes, especially in individuals of African, Mediterranean, or Southeast Asian descent.",Success
A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue and joint pain for the past 4 months. Examination shows erythema with scaling on both cheeks that spares the nasolabial folds and two 1-cm ulcers in the oral cavity. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?,A,"The correct answer is C. Increased complement component 3.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The erythema with scaling on both cheeks that spares the nasolabial folds is a classic finding known as a ""butterfly rash,"" which is a hallmark of SLE. The presence of oral ulcers also supports this diagnosis.

In SLE, the immune system produces excessive amounts of antibodies, which can lead to inflammation and tissue damage. Complement components, such as C3, are proteins that play a key role in the immune response. In SLE, the complement system is often activated, leading to increased levels of complement components, including C3.

The other options are not likely to be associated with SLE:

A. Decreased lymphocyte count: While lymphopenia can occur in SLE, it is not a characteristic finding.

B. Increased platelet count: Thrombocytosis is not typically associated with SLE.

D. Increased prothrombin time: SLE is not typically associated with coagulation disorders or increased prothrombin time.

E. Decreased gamma globulin: Hypogammaglobulinemia is not a characteristic finding in SLE. In fact, many patients with SLE have hypergammaglobulinemia due to the production of excessive amounts of antibodies.

It's worth noting that the diagnosis of SLE is typically made based on a combination of clinical and laboratory findings, including the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and other autoantibodies.",Success
"A 66-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction presents to your primary care office with complaints of dyspnea on exertion and swollen feet and ankles. On exam, you note an elevated JVP and 2+ pitting edema of bilateral lower extremities. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema?",A,"The correct answer is A. Increase in capillary pressure.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion, elevated JVP, and bilateral lower extremity edema, suggest congestive heart failure (CHF) as the underlying cause. In CHF, the heart is unable to pump effectively, leading to increased pressure in the veins and capillaries. This increased pressure pushes fluid out of the capillaries and into the interstitial space, causing edema.

Option A, Increase in capillary pressure, is the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema. The increased pressure in the capillaries is a result of the heart's inability to pump effectively, leading to fluid accumulation in the interstitial space.

Let's quickly review the other options:

B. Decrease in plasma proteins: While a decrease in plasma proteins (hypoalbuminemia) can contribute to edema, it is not the primary cause in this patient. The patient's symptoms, such as dyspnea on exertion and elevated JVP, point to CHF as the underlying cause.

C. Increase in capillary permeability: An increase in capillary permeability can cause edema, but it is not the primary cause in this patient. The patient's symptoms are more suggestive of CHF, and an increase in capillary permeability would not explain the elevated JVP.

D. Increase in colloid osmotic pressure: This option is incorrect because an increase in colloid osmotic pressure would actually decrease edema, not increase it.

E. Increase in interstitial fluid pressure: While an increase in interstitial fluid pressure can contribute to edema, it is not the primary cause in this patient. The patient's symptoms suggest CHF, which leads to increased capillary pressure and subsequent edema.

In summary, the correct answer is A. Increase in capillary pressure, which is a result of the patient's underlying CHF.",Success
A 49-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He feels well and has no history of serious illness.

The patient's 25-year history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily increases his risk for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. According to the American Cancer Society, smoking is a major risk factor for pancreatic cancer, and the risk increases with the number of years and packs smoked per day. The patient's moderate wine consumption is not a significant risk factor for pancreatic cancer.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's smoking history:

B. Gastric MALT lymphoma is associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, not smoking.

C. Esophageal varices are a complication of portal hypertension, often seen in patients with liver cirrhosis, which is not directly related to smoking.

D. Porcelain gallbladder is a calcification of the gallbladder wall, which is associated with gallstones and is not directly related to smoking.

E. Hepatic steatosis, also known as fatty liver disease, is associated with obesity, diabetes, and heavy alcohol consumption, but not specifically with smoking.

"A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of difficulty sleeping and fatigue. Menses occur at irregular 35- to 50-day intervals and last 3–7 days. Her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. She has had an unintentional 10-kg (22-lb) weight gain over this period. She also reports decreased sexual desire and increased hair growth on her face and arms. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows central obesity, increased pigmented hair over the chin and upper lip, and purple stretch marks on the abdomen. She has a prominent hump of fat over the base of the dorsum of her neck and decreased proximal muscle tone and strength. Serum studies show:
Na+ 154 mEq/L
K+ 2.8 mEq/L

HCO3- 30 mEq/L
Creatinine 0.9 mg/dL
Glucose 236 mg/dL
ACTH 2 pg/mL (N = 7–50)
Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?""",B,"The correct answer is D. Transsphenoidal hypophysectomy.

This patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Cushing's syndrome, a hormonal disorder caused by excessive levels of cortisol in the body. The patient's irregular menses, weight gain, fatigue, decreased sexual desire, and increased hair growth on her face and arms are all indicative of hypercortisolism. The physical examination findings of central obesity, increased pigmented hair, purple stretch marks on the abdomen, and a prominent hump of fat over the base of the dorsum of her neck (known as a buffalo hump) further support this diagnosis.

The laboratory results also support the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. The patient's low potassium level (2.8 mEq/L) is consistent with cortisol-induced hypokalemia. The elevated glucose level (236 mg/dL) is also consistent with hypercortisolism, which can cause insulin resistance and hyperglycemia. The low ACTH level (2 pg/mL) suggests that the patient's cortisol excess is not driven by an ACTH-producing tumor, but rather by an ACTH-independent mechanism, such as an adrenal tumor or a pituitary adenoma.

Given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is a pituitary adenoma causing Cushing's disease. The treatment of choice for Cushing's disease is transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, which involves surgically removing the pituitary adenoma through the nasal passages.

Metyrapone therapy (Option A) is a medication that can be used to treat Cushing's syndrome, but it is not a definitive treatment and is typically used as a bridge to surgery or in patients who are not surgical candidates.

Adrenalectomy (Option B) would be the treatment of choice if the patient had an adrenal tumor causing Cushing's syndrome, but the patient's low ACTH level suggests that the cortisol excess is not driven by an adrenal tumor.

Polychemotherapy and radiation therapy (Option C) are not indicated for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome or Cushing's disease.

Partial nephrectomy (Option E) is not relevant to the treatment of Cushing's syndrome or Cushing's disease.",Success
A scientist observes a myocyte beating in cell culture. Which step is the most direct necessary component of relaxation for this cell?,E,"The correct answer is E. Efflux of calcium ions.

Relaxation in a myocyte (muscle cell) occurs when the muscle cell returns to its resting state after contraction. The most direct necessary component of relaxation is the removal of calcium ions from the cytosol, which is achieved through the efflux of calcium ions.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Influx of sodium ions: Sodium ions play a role in the depolarization of the myocyte, leading to muscle contraction, but they are not directly involved in relaxation.

B. Efflux of potassium ions: Potassium ions do play a role in repolarization, but their efflux is not the most direct necessary component of relaxation.

C. Influx of calcium ions from the sacroplasmic reticulum: Calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum are involved in muscle contraction, not relaxation.

D. Influx of calcium ions from outside the myocyte: Calcium ions from outside the myocyte are involved in muscle contraction, not relaxation.

During muscle contraction, calcium ions bind to troponin and tropomyosin, allowing the myosin head to bind to actin and produce muscle contraction. For relaxation to occur, calcium ions must be removed from the cytosol, allowing the troponin-tropomyosin complex to return to its resting state, and the myosin head to release its grip on actin. This is achieved through the efflux of calcium ions, primarily through the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump.

Therefore, the correct answer is E. Efflux of calcium ions.",Success

Which of the following would have been most effective in preventing this patient's current symptoms?""",E,"The correct answer is D. Allopurinol.

The patient's symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle cramps, are consistent with hyperuricemia, which is a common complication of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS occurs when cancer cells are rapidly destroyed, releasing their contents, including uric acid, into the bloodstream. The laboratory results show an elevated uric acid level of 11.2 mg/dL, which supports this diagnosis.

Allopurinol is a medication that inhibits the production of uric acid and is commonly used to prevent and treat hyperuricemia in patients at risk of TLS, such as those with acute myelogenous leukemia. It would have been most effective in preventing the patient's current symptoms.

Rasburicase (option C) is an enzyme that breaks down uric acid and is used to treat hyperuricemia in patients with TLS. While it may be effective in treating the patient's current symptoms, it would not have been as effective in preventing them as allopurinol.

Urine alkalinization (option A) may help increase the excretion of uric acid, but it is not as effective as allopurinol in preventing hyperuricemia.

Corticosteroids (option B) are not typically used to prevent or treat hyperuricemia.

Intravenous hydration (option E) is important in managing TLS, but it would not have been enough to prevent the patient's symptoms on its own.

It's worth noting that the patient's treatment should also include aggressive hydration, electrolyte monitoring, and management of other potential complications of TLS.",Success
"The menses are 4 weeks overdue in a 23-year-old sexually active woman, thus she is scheduled for an ultrasound examination. The result is shown in the exhibit. What is the function of the structure marked with the green arrow?",B,"The correct answer is D. Production of progesterone.

The ultrasound image shows a gestational sac with a yolk sac, which is a characteristic finding in early pregnancy. The green arrow is pointing to the yolk sac.

The yolk sac is a structure that develops from the blastocyst and plays a crucial role in early embryonic development. One of its main functions is to produce progesterone, which helps maintain the pregnancy by supporting the growth of the embryo and preventing uterine contractions.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Removal of nitrogenous waste is a function of the kidneys, not the yolk sac.

B. Embryonic hematopoiesis (blood cell formation) occurs in the liver and spleen of the fetus, not in the yolk sac.

C. Production of amniotic fluid is a function of the amnion, which is a membrane that surrounds the fetus, not the yolk sac.

E. Gas exchange occurs in the placenta, not the yolk sac.

According to current medical guidelines and embryology textbooks, the yolk sac is responsible for producing progesterone in early pregnancy, making option D the correct answer.",Success
"A 49-year-old man comes to the physician because he has had multiple falls and multiple episodes of dizziness over the past 6 weeks. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. He drinks one pint of rum daily. He works as a foreman in a factory that produces industrial solvents. He is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. His temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 108/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a wide-based gait. The patient is unable to stand with his feet together without support. There is a coarse tremor of the hands when he is asked to grab a pen. Muscle strength and tone are normal in all extremities. Sensation to pain, vibration, and position is intact bilaterally. Rapid alternating movements of the hands is impaired. Mental status examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Cerebellar degeneration.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including multiple falls, dizziness, wide-based gait, and inability to stand with his feet together without support, suggest a problem with balance and coordination. The presence of a coarse tremor in the hands, particularly when performing rapid alternating movements, further supports this conclusion. The normal muscle strength and tone, as well as intact sensation to pain, vibration, and position, rule out peripheral neuropathy or myopathy as the primary cause.

The patient's occupation as a foreman in a factory that produces industrial solvents raises the possibility of solvent toxicity, which can cause cerebellar degeneration. Chronic alcohol abuse, as evidenced by the patient's daily consumption of one pint of rum, can also contribute to cerebellar degeneration.

The other options can be ruled out based on the patient's presentation:

A. Korsakoff syndrome is a chronic memory disorder that typically occurs in patients with a history of Wernicke's encephalopathy. While the patient may have a history of alcohol abuse, there is no mention of memory impairment or other cognitive deficits.

B. Subacute combined degeneration is a condition caused by vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause a range of neurological symptoms, including ataxia. However, the patient's normal mental status examination and lack of other characteristic features, such as paresthesias or weakness, make this diagnosis less likely.

C. Methanol poisoning typically presents with acute symptoms, including headache, nausea, and visual disturbances, which are not present in this patient.

E. Wernicke's encephalopathy is an acute condition characterized by the triad of encephalopathy, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. While the patient has ataxia, there is no mention of encephalopathy or ophthalmoplegia, making this diagnosis less likely.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and occupational history suggest cerebellar degeneration as the most likely cause of his condition.",Success
"A 7-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother for a well-child examination. The mother reports that she had her first menstrual period 1 week ago. She has no history of serious illness. Immunizations are up-to-date. Physical examination shows Tanner stage 3 breast development and pubic hair. Without treatment, this patient is at greatest risk for which of the following as an adult?",B,"The correct answer is B. Short stature.

The patient is experiencing precocious puberty, which is defined as the onset of puberty before the age of 8 in girls. This condition can lead to accelerated bone maturation, resulting in premature closure of the epiphyseal growth plates. As a consequence, the patient may experience short stature as an adult.

The other options are not directly related to precocious puberty:

A. Delayed skeletal maturity is not a typical consequence of precocious puberty. In fact, the opposite is true, as the bones mature more quickly than usual.

C. Genu varum, also known as bowleggedness, is not a known complication of precocious puberty.

D. Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by low bone density, which is not directly related to precocious puberty. While osteoporosis can be a concern in individuals with a history of precocious puberty, it is not the most significant risk factor.

E. Coarse facial features are not a typical characteristic of precocious puberty. This option is more commonly associated with congenital adrenal hyperplasia or other genetic disorders.

It's essential to note that prompt medical attention and possible treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs can help mitigate the risk of short stature and other complications associated with precocious puberty.",Success
"A 67-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a follow up appointment. He was released from the hospital 1 week ago for an appropriately managed ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); however, he has not filled any of his prescriptions and did not attend his follow up appointment as scheduled. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. His temperature is 97.5°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 167/118 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for jugular venous distention and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Echocardiography demonstrates an ejection fraction of 55%. Which of the following medications will have the greatest mortality benefit in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is C. Lisinopril.

This patient has a history of STEMI and has not filled his prescriptions or attended his follow-up appointment. He presents with signs of heart failure, including jugular venous distention and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. The echocardiogram shows a preserved ejection fraction of 55%.

According to current guidelines, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are recommended for patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) to reduce mortality and morbidity. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, has been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with a history of MI, particularly in those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

The other options are not incorrect, but they do not have the same level of mortality benefit as lisinopril in this patient population:

* Atenolol (A) and metoprolol succinate (D) are beta blockers, which are also recommended for patients with a history of MI, but they are primarily used to reduce symptoms and prevent future cardiac events, rather than specifically reducing mortality.
* Hydrochlorothiazide (B) is a diuretic that may be used to manage hypertension and heart failure, but it does not have the same level of mortality benefit as an ACE inhibitor or ARB.
* Propranolol (E) is a non-selective beta blocker that is not typically used in the management of MI or heart failure due to its potential to exacerbate heart failure and increase mortality.

The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend the use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients with a history of MI, particularly in those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Therefore, lisinopril is the correct answer.",Success
A 61-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of a productive cough and worsening shortness of breath. He has had frequent episodes of a productive cough over the past 3 years. He had smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit 1 year ago. He appears distressed. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. Chest auscultation reveals diffuse wheezes and coarse crackles. A chest x-ray shows increased lung lucency bilaterally and flattening of the diaphragm. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy?,A,"The correct answer is A. Prednisone and albuterol.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's history of smoking, productive cough, and shortness of breath, along with the chest x-ray findings of increased lung lucency and flattening of the diaphragm, support this diagnosis.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines recommend that patients with COPD exacerbations receive a short course of systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to reduce inflammation and improve lung function. Additionally, a bronchodilator, such as albuterol, is recommended to help relieve bronchospasm and improve airflow.

Option A, prednisone and albuterol, is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy because it addresses both the inflammatory and bronchospastic components of the patient's exacerbation.

Option B, albuterol and montelukast, is not appropriate because montelukast is a leukotriene modifier typically used in asthma, not COPD.

Option C, prednisone and tiotropium, is not the best initial choice because tiotropium is a long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator that is typically used as maintenance therapy in COPD, not for acute exacerbations.

Option D, albuterol and theophylline, is not recommended because theophylline has a narrow therapeutic index and can cause significant side effects, especially in older adults.

Option E, roflumilast and prednisone, is not appropriate because roflumilast is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor that is used as an add-on therapy in severe COPD, but it is not recommended for acute exacerbations.

In summary, the combination of prednisone and albuterol is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for this patient's COPD exacerbation.",Success
An investigator is studying cellular regeneration of epithelial cells. She has obtained a tissue sample from a normal thyroid gland for histopathologic examination. It shows follicles lined by a single layer of cube-like cells with large central nuclei. Which of the following parts of the female reproductive tract is also lined by this type of epithelium?,A,"The correct answer is E. Cervix.

The description of the epithelial cells in the thyroid gland tissue sample, ""a single layer of cube-like cells with large central nuclei,"" is characteristic of simple cuboidal epithelium. This type of epithelium is also found in the endocervix, which is the mucosal lining of the cervical canal.

The endocervix is lined by simple cuboidal epithelium, which is responsible for producing mucus that helps to facilitate sperm transport and provides a barrier against infection.

A. Ovaries are lined by simple squamous epithelium (germinal epithelium) or cuboidal epithelium in the ovarian follicles.

B. Vagina is lined by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.

C. Fallopian tubes are lined by ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, which helps to facilitate the movement of the ovum towards the uterus.

She has also tried nicotine lozenges but stopped taking them because of severe headaches and insomnia. She has bulimia nervosa. She takes no medications. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is D. Motivational interviewing.

Here's why:

The patient is seeking advice on smoking cessation, which is a great opportunity for the healthcare provider to intervene. Given her history of failed quit attempts and concerns about weight gain and nervousness, a comprehensive approach is necessary.

Motivational interviewing (MI) is a patient-centered counseling approach that focuses on exploring and resolving ambivalence about behavior change. It's an evidence-based technique that has been shown to be effective in promoting smoking cessation. MI can help the patient identify her motivations for quitting, address her concerns, and develop a personalized quit plan.

The other options are not the most appropriate next step in management:

A. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be addictive and is not recommended for smoking cessation.

B. Nicotine patch is a pharmacological intervention that may be helpful, but it's not the best first step. The patient has already tried nicotine lozenges and experienced adverse effects. Additionally, the patch may not address the patient's underlying concerns and motivations.

C. Varenicline is a prescription medication that can help with smoking cessation, but it's not the most appropriate first step. The patient has a history of bulimia nervosa, and varenicline may interact with her mental health condition.

E. Fluoxetine is an antidepressant that may be helpful for managing the patient's bulimia nervosa, but it's not directly related to smoking cessation.

By choosing motivational interviewing as the initial approach, the healthcare provider can establish a collaborative relationship with the patient, understand her unique challenges and motivations, and develop a personalized plan to help her quit smoking successfully.",Success
"A hospitalized 34-year-old man with severe diarrhea and bloating for 1 month is diagnosed with celiac disease based on serology and duodenal biopsy. He has no history of any serious illnesses and takes no medications. He has no history of recent travel. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. At discharge from the hospital, he is given complete instructions for a strict gluten-free diet. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for the temporary control of the severe diarrhea and bloating?",A,"The correct answer is A. Avoiding all dairy products.

Here's why:

In celiac disease, the immune system reacts to gluten, leading to inflammation and damage in the small intestine. This can cause malabsorption of nutrients, including lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. As a result, individuals with celiac disease may experience lactose intolerance, which can exacerbate diarrhea and bloating.

Avoiding dairy products temporarily can help alleviate these symptoms while the patient's gut heals and adjusts to the gluten-free diet. This is a common recommendation in the management of celiac disease, especially during the initial phase of treatment.

Now, let's discuss why the other options are not the most appropriate:

B. Diphenoxylate is an antidiarrheal medication that can help manage diarrhea, but it does not address the underlying issue of lactose intolerance or malabsorption.

C. Metronidazole is an antibiotic, which is not indicated for the treatment of celiac disease or its symptoms. Empirical therapy with metronidazole is not recommended in this scenario.

D. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that can be used to reduce inflammation in certain conditions, but it is not typically used in the management of celiac disease.

E. Restriction of soy products is not necessary in the management of celiac disease, as soy is not a common trigger for the condition.

In summary, temporarily avoiding dairy products is the most appropriate recommendation for controlling severe diarrhea and bloating in a patient with newly diagnosed celiac disease.",Success

He is started on furosemide, carvedilol, and oxygen therapy. After 6-hours of continued therapy, his blood pressure remains low, and his serum creatinine is found to be 1.9 mg/dL. Which of the following test would be more useful to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease?",D,"The correct answer is D. Fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea).

The patient's presentation suggests acute decompensated heart failure, and the low blood pressure and elevated serum creatinine raise concerns about acute kidney injury (AKI). Differentiating between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease is crucial to guide further management.

Fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) is a useful test to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease. FEUrea is calculated as (Urea excretion / Urea filtration) × 100. In prerenal AKI, the FEUrea is typically <35-40%, indicating that the kidneys are conserving urea in response to decreased perfusion. In intrinsic AKI, the FEUrea is usually >50-60%, suggesting that the kidneys are not able to reabsorb urea effectively due to tubular damage.

The other options are not as useful for differentiating between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease:

A. Sulfosalicylic acid test is used to detect proteinuria, which is not specific to prerenal or intrinsic kidney disease.

B. Urine sodium content can be helpful, but it has limitations. In prerenal AKI, urine sodium is typically <20 mmol/L, while in intrinsic AKI, it is often >40 mmol/L. However, this test can be influenced by diuretic use, which is a confounding factor in this patient.

C. Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa+) is also used to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic AKI, but it can be affected by diuretic use and is less specific than FEUrea.

E. Nitrates in urine are not relevant to differentiating between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease.

In summary, FEUrea is the most useful test to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease in this patient, given the clinical context and the limitations of other options.",Success

This patient's presentation is consistent with Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and diclofenac. The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and physical examination findings support this diagnosis.

The patient's urinary output is decreased, indicating acute kidney injury. The laboratory results show an elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, indicating renal impairment.

On physical examination, she has regular heart sounds but does have 1+ pitting edema to her bilateral lower extremities. What is her New York Heart Association Functional Classification for congestive heart failure?",D,"The correct answer is D. New York Heart Association Class III.

The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification is a system used to classify the severity of heart failure based on the patient's symptoms and functional capacity. The classification system ranges from Class I (no symptoms) to Class IV (severe symptoms at rest).

In this case, the patient presents with worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure, including fatigue and shortness of breath, which are exacerbated by physical activity. However, her symptoms are alleviated by sitting down, indicating that she is not experiencing symptoms at rest. This corresponds to NYHA Class III, which is defined as ""marked limitation in physical activity; comfortable at rest; less than ordinary physical activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. NYHA Class I: This classification is for patients with no symptoms and no limitation in physical activity, which does not match the patient's presentation.

B. NYHA Class IIa: This classification is for patients with slight limitation in physical activity, but the patient's symptoms are more severe, indicating a higher classification.

C. NYHA Class IIb: This classification is for patients with marked limitation in physical activity, but they are still comfortable during ordinary physical activity. The patient's symptoms are more severe, and she is not comfortable during ordinary physical activity.

E. NYHA Class IV: This classification is for patients with severe symptoms at rest, which is not the case for this patient, as her symptoms are alleviated by sitting down.

Vital signs are within normal limits. There is decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face bilaterally. Muscle strength is 3/5 in the left upper extremity and 5/5 in the right upper extremity. There is spasticity of the lower extremities with sustained clonus. Further evaluation is most likely going to reveal which of the following findings?",B,"The correct answer is B. Multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). The intermittent stabbing face pain, triggered by touching her face or brushing her teeth, is consistent with trigeminal neuralgia, which is a common symptom of MS. The bilateral decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face, weakness in the left upper extremity, and spasticity of the lower extremities with sustained clonus are also consistent with MS.

The patient's history of weakness in her right arm that lasted for about a week four months ago suggests a previous demyelinating event, which is a hallmark of MS. The family history of migrainous headaches in her mother and brother is not directly related to the diagnosis, but it may suggest a genetic predisposition to neurological disorders.

Multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques are a characteristic finding on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with MS. These plaques are areas of demyelination and axonal damage that occur in the central nervous system, particularly in the periventricular regions.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Gingival swelling, erythema, and pus drainage are signs of a dental infection, which is not related to the patient's symptoms.

C. Erythematous papules in the V2/V3 nerve distribution are more consistent with a diagnosis of shingles or herpes zoster, which is not supported by the patient's other symptoms.

D. Photophobia and phonophobia are symptoms of migraines, which are not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

"A 23-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 28 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal examination. Her previous pregnancy was uncomplicated and she gave birth to a healthy boy. Her blood group is A, Rh-negative. The father's blood group is B, Rh-positive. Administration of which of the following is most appropriate at this time?",B,"The correct answer is B. Anti-D IgG.

Here's why:

The patient is Rh-negative, and the father is Rh-positive. This means there is a risk of Rh sensitization, where the mother's immune system produces antibodies against the Rh antigen on the fetal red blood cells. To prevent this, Rh immune globulin (anti-D IgG) is administered to Rh-negative women during pregnancy.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that Rh-negative women receive anti-D IgG at 28 weeks' gestation, which is the current scenario. This is because the risk of sensitization is highest during the third trimester.

Anti-D IgG is the correct choice because it is the specific antibody that targets the Rh antigen. IgG is the appropriate immunoglobulin class because it can cross the placenta and provide protection to the fetus.

The other options are incorrect:

A. Anti-A IgG is not relevant in this scenario, as the patient's blood group is A, and the concern is Rh sensitization.

C. Anti-B IgG is not relevant, as the father's blood group is B, but the concern is Rh sensitization, not ABO incompatibility.

D. Anti-D IgM is not the correct choice because IgM antibodies do not cross the placenta and are not effective in preventing Rh sensitization.

E. Anti-A IgM is not relevant, as the patient's blood group is A, and the concern is Rh sensitization.

In summary, the administration of anti-D IgG at 28 weeks' gestation is the most appropriate choice to prevent Rh sensitization in this Rh-negative patient.",Success
"A 61-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of excessive thirst, frequent urination, and partial visual loss in both eyes for 1 day. His family history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus in his mother and cousin. His weight is 112 kg ( 246.9 lb), height 187 cm (6 ft 1 in), blood pressure: 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate: 89/min, respiratory rate: 14/min, and temperature: 36.7℃ (98.4℉). The physical examination is significant for dry skin, a pustular rash over the patient’s shoulders and back, an accentuated second heart sound (S2) best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border, and distal loss of vibration sensitivity in both feet. A fundoscopic examination shows small red dots in the superficial retinal layers suggestive of microaneurysms. The HbA1c is 9% and the urinalysis shows the following:

Which of the following statements best describes the cause of this patient’s glucosuria?",C,"The correct answer is C. Secondary active transporters fail to complete reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules.

Here's why:

The patient's urinalysis shows glucosuria (199 mg/dl), which is an abnormal amount of glucose in the urine. In a healthy individual, the kidneys reabsorb almost all of the filtered glucose in the proximal renal tubules through a process called secondary active transport. This process involves the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) and is driven by the sodium gradient created by the sodium-potassium pump.

In this patient, the glucosuria is likely due to the inability of the kidneys to reabsorb glucose completely, resulting in its appearance in the urine. This is because the patient has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, as evidenced by the high HbA1c level (9%). The high blood glucose levels overwhelm the kidney's ability to reabsorb glucose, leading to glucosuria.

The other options are not correct:

A. Yeast metabolism does not contribute to glucosuria.

B. Primary active transport is not directly involved in glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules.

D. Passive transport is not the primary mechanism of glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules.

E. An increased glomerular filtration rate would not directly cause glucosuria. While it's true that an increased glomerular filtration rate can lead to an increased amount of glucose filtered by the kidneys, the kidneys would still be able to reabsorb most of it under normal circumstances.

It's worth noting that the patient's urinalysis also shows other abnormalities, such as proteinuria (120 mg/dl) and the presence of yeast, which may indicate a urinary tract infection. However, these findings are not directly related to the cause of glucosuria in this patient.",Success
"A 65-year-old male presents to his primary care physician for stiffness in his arm. He states that he has been having trouble combing his hair and reaching objects that are high on the shelf. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, and hypertension. His current medications include metformin, insulin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient admits to leading a sedentary life in which he tends to stay home and watch television. He does not engage in any physical or strenuous activity. On physical exam the patient has decreased passive and active range of motion of his shoulder. Strength of the patient's upper extremity is 4/5. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Adhesive capsulitis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as stiffness in the arm, difficulty combing his hair, and reaching high objects, are consistent with a condition that affects the shoulder joint. The physical exam findings of decreased passive and active range of motion of the shoulder, along with 4/5 strength in the upper extremity, further support this.

Adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder, is a condition characterized by inflammation and scarring of the joint capsule, leading to stiffness and limited mobility of the shoulder. It is more common in people with diabetes, as in this case, and is often associated with a sedentary lifestyle.

While rotator cuff impingement (A) can cause shoulder pain and stiffness, it is less likely to cause the significant limitation in range of motion seen in this patient. Biceps tendinopathy (C) typically presents with anterior shoulder pain and weakness, which is not the primary complaint in this case. Glenohumeral osteoarthritis (D) may cause shoulder stiffness, but it is typically associated with crepitus and pain, which are not mentioned in the scenario. Subacromial bursitis (E) is an inflammation of the bursa that lies between the acromion and the rotator cuff tendons, and it typically presents with pain and swelling in the lateral shoulder, rather than stiffness and limited mobility.

The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) and the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) guidelines support the diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis in patients with shoulder stiffness and limited mobility, particularly in those with underlying diabetes and sedentary lifestyle.",Success
"A 52-year-old man presents to the clinic with a headache and dizziness for the past month. The patient reports that about 4 weeks ago he developed a “nagging” headache. He thought he had a cold, so he tried over the counter ibuprofen that provided only mild and temporary relief. Recently, he also started feeling dizzy and nauseous, which only resolves when he steps outside to shovel the snow. The patient’s medical history is significant for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and asthma. His medications include amlodipine, metformin, glimepiride, and a fluticasone/salmeterol inhaler. The patient has been living at his upstate cabin for the past 5 weeks but denies other recent travel. He denies smoking tobacco or illicit drug use. The patient’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 130/78 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 16/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is currently asymptomatic while sitting in the office, and physical examination is unremarkable. Labs are drawn, as shown below:

Hemoglobin: 20 g/dL
Hematocrit: 60%
Leukocyte count: 10,050 cells/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 350,000/mm^3

Which of the following underlies the patient’s most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Toxic exposure.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the headache and dizziness, are likely related to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. The key clues in the patient's history that suggest CO poisoning are:

1. The patient has been living in a cabin for 5 weeks, which increases the risk of CO exposure from faulty heating systems or generators.
2. The patient's symptoms improve when he steps outside, which suggests that he is being exposed to a toxic substance indoors.
3. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit, which is consistent with CO poisoning. CO binds to hemoglobin, causing an increase in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Medication side effect: There is no evidence to suggest that the patient's medications are causing his symptoms.

B. Myeloproliferative neoplasm: The patient's laboratory results do not suggest a myeloproliferative disorder, and his symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.

C. Neuronal hyperexcitability: This option is not supported by the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

E. Viral infection: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a viral infection.

CO poisoning is a common and potentially life-threatening condition that can occur in individuals who are exposed to faulty heating systems, generators, or other sources of CO. It is essential to consider CO poisoning in patients who present with headaches, dizziness, and other nonspecific symptoms, especially if they have a history of exposure to potential sources of CO.",Success
"A 20-year-old woman comes to the clinic for her first follow-up visit after being diagnosed with bipolar I disorder 1-month ago. At that time, she was acutely severely manic and was brought to the emergency department by her concerned boyfriend. She was started on lithium, and after subsequent improvement, she was discharged. A week after discharge, the patient forgot to take her medication for a few days and quickly began to manifest manic symptoms again which required brought her to the emergency department again. Since then, she has been compliant with her medications and currently has no significant complaints. Which of the following recommendations would be most helpful in minimizing the risk to the fetus in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is B. Supplement all patients with 5mg of daily folic acid.

Justification:

The patient is a 20-year-old woman with bipolar I disorder, and the question is asking about minimizing the risk to the fetus, implying that she is planning to become pregnant or is already pregnant. Lithium, her current medication, is a known teratogen, particularly in the first trimester, and can increase the risk of cardiac malformations in the fetus.

Folic acid supplementation is recommended for all women of childbearing age, especially those with a history of taking teratogenic medications, to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that all women of childbearing age take a daily supplement of 0.4-0.8 mg (400-800 mcg) of folic acid. However, some studies suggest that a higher dose of 5mg daily may be more effective in reducing the risk of NTDs.

The other options are not correct:

A. Adjusting the dosage of medication throughout pregnancy may be necessary, but it is not the most helpful recommendation in minimizing the risk to the fetus.

C. Low-dose polytherapy is not preferred over monotherapy in this scenario, and the safety of polytherapy during pregnancy is not well established.

D. Discontinuing the medication when conception is confirmed is not recommended, as it can lead to a relapse of the patient's bipolar disorder, which can have negative consequences for both the mother and the fetus.

E. Valproate is not considered safe during pregnancy due to its association with an increased risk of birth defects, including NTDs, craniofacial abnormalities, and cognitive impairment. It is not a preferred alternative to lithium during pregnancy.

In summary, supplementing with 5mg of daily folic acid is the most helpful recommendation in minimizing the risk to the fetus in this patient.",Success
"A 19-year-old female presents to the emergency room with 6 days of lower abdominal pain. She states that her symptoms have progressed and she now feels feverish as well. She also notes an episode of nonbloody diarrhea 2 days ago and has been increasingly nauseous. While being evaluated in the emergency room, she vomits three times. The patient has no significant past medical history but was recently treated with ciprofloxacin for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection. She also notes irregular periods, with a last menstrual period 6 weeks ago. She is a college student who has had 3 sexual partners in the last year with inconsistent use of barrier protection. Her temperature is 100.5°C (38.1°F), blood pressure is 102/68 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, and respirations are 14/min. On exam, the patient is noticeably uncomfortable. There is marked tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic region and right lower quadrant, with voluntary guarding but no rebound. Pelvic exam shows moderate purulent discharge in the vaginal vault, cervical motion tenderness, and a tender adnexal mass on the right side. Which of the following is the best next step in treating this patient’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline with inpatient admission.

This patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a serious infection of the female reproductive organs. The patient's recent treatment with ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection may have contributed to the development of PID by disrupting the normal vaginal flora.

The patient's symptoms, including lower abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting, suggest a more severe infection that requires hospitalization. The pelvic exam findings of purulent discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and a tender adnexal mass on the right side further support the diagnosis of PID.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend hospitalization for patients with PID who have severe symptoms, such as high fever, nausea, and vomiting, or who have a tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) or peritonitis. Inpatient treatment with intravenous antibiotics is necessary to provide adequate coverage for the possible pathogens, including Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and anaerobes.

Cefotetan is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers a range of pathogens, including anaerobes, which are commonly found in PID. Doxycycline is added to cover Chlamydia trachomatis, which is a common cause of PID.

Option A is incorrect because outpatient treatment with oral antibiotics is not sufficient for a patient with severe symptoms and a tender adnexal mass. Option C is incorrect because vancomycin is not a recommended antibiotic for PID. Option D is incorrect because methotrexate is not an antibiotic and is not used to treat PID. Option E is incorrect because exploratory laparotomy is not a first-line treatment for PID and is typically reserved for patients with a ruptured TOA or other surgical emergencies.",Success
"A 72-year-old man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital for the evaluation of breathlessness and fatigue. His pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Further evaluation shows a systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg × min/L with an end-systolic volume of 80 mL. Which of the following describes the ejection fraction in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is C. 35%.

To determine the ejection fraction, we need to know the end-systolic volume (ESV) and the end-diastolic volume (EDV). The ejection fraction (EF) is calculated using the formula:

EF = (EDV - ESV) / EDV

We are given the ESV as 80 mL, but we need to find the EDV. We can use the formula:

EDV = ESV / (1 - EF)

Since we don't know the EF yet, we can use the given information about the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) to estimate the EF. A normal SVR is around 1200-1600 dyn·s·cm⁻⁵, and a value of 35 mm Hg × min/L is low, indicating that the patient has a low afterload. This suggests that the heart is not working against a high resistance, which would lead to a higher EF.

Using the normal range of EF (50-70%), we can estimate the EDV. Let's assume an EF of 35% (option C). Then:

EDV = 80 mL / (1 - 0.35) = 123 mL

Now we can calculate the EF:

EF = (123 mL - 80 mL) / 123 mL = 0.35 or 35%

This calculation supports option C as the correct answer. Note that the other options (A, B, D, and E) would result in unrealistic EDV values or contradict the given information about the SVR.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman presents to the office for evaluation of intermittent vertigo for the past 2 days. She complains of vomiting and complete hearing loss in her left ear. The patient believes she had an ear infection in the same ear but never sought out treatment. She has a past medical history of uterine fibroids. She takes mifepristone daily to reduce the size of the fibroids. Her blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg, the heart rate is 68/min, the respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). The patient appears pale and in mild distress. Otoscopy reveals a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane is observed to be immobile as confirmed by the pneumatoscope. Pure-tone audiometry testing reveals hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear. Heart auscultation is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Nystagmus is positive to the right. MRI of the brain does not reveal a tumor or abscess. Her physician orders a complete blood count with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel, which show:
Hemoglobin 14.5 gm/dL
Hematocrit 43.2 %
White blood cells 14,500 /mm3
Platelets 312,000/mm3
Neutrophil 81.6%

Monocyte 1.4%
Eosinophil 1.2%
Basophil 0.6%
Serum Na+ 138 mEq/L
K+ 4.3 mEq/L
Cl- 108 mmol/L
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL
Which of the following is the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient?",D,"The correct answer is C. Cefotaxime.

The patient presents with symptoms of vertigo, vomiting, and complete hearing loss in her left ear, which is consistent with a diagnosis of suppurative labyrinthitis. The otoscopy findings of a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane and immobility of the tympanic membrane on pneumatoscopy suggest a diagnosis of acute otitis media (AOM). The presence of nystagmus to the right and hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear further support this diagnosis.

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most appropriate antibiotic choice would be Cefotaxime. Cefotaxime is a third-generation cephalosporin that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, which are common causes of AOM.

Ofloxacin (Option A) is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is not typically used as a first-line treatment for AOM. Cefepime (Option B) is a fourth-generation cephalosporin that is usually reserved for more severe infections or those caused by resistant organisms. Amoxicillin (Option D) is a first-line treatment for AOM, but it may not be effective against beta-lactamase-producing organisms, which are common in AOM. Cephalexin (Option E) is a first-generation cephalosporin that is not typically used for AOM.

It's worth noting that the patient's use of mifepristone for uterine fibroids does not contraindicate the use of any of the antibiotics listed. However, it's essential to consider the patient's medical history and potential interactions with medications when selecting an antibiotic.",Success
"A 52-year-old woman presents to the emergency department due to severe pain of her first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. This pain started acutely, and she describes the pain as sharp. Her medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, and extensive alcohol use. She takes a number of medications but does not remember what they are. On physical exam, her right first MTP joint appears warm, swollen, erythematous, and exquisitely painful to the touch. After resolution of this acute episode, the patient is started on a drug to prevent recurrence of the symptoms. One month later on follow-up, she is found to have pancytopenia. Which of the following describes the mechanism of the drug most likely prescribed in this case?",D,"The correct answer is D. Inhibitor of xanthine oxidase.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms are consistent with an acute gout attack, which is characterized by sudden, severe pain, swelling, and redness in a joint, typically the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. The patient's medical history, including obesity and extensive alcohol use, are also risk factors for gout.

After the acute episode, the patient was started on a medication to prevent recurrence of symptoms. The development of pancytopenia (a decrease in all three blood cell types: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) one month later suggests that the medication is likely allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor.

Allopurinol is commonly used to prevent gout attacks by reducing the production of uric acid, which is the underlying cause of gout. However, it can cause bone marrow suppression, leading to pancytopenia, as a rare but serious side effect.

The other options do not match the clinical scenario:

A. Antibody to soluble factor: This mechanism is more likely related to immunomodulatory medications, which are not typically used to prevent gout attacks.

B. Inhibitor of microtubule polymerization: This mechanism is related to medications like colchicine, which is used to treat acute gout attacks, but not for long-term prevention.

C. Inhibitor of proximal tubule reabsorption: This mechanism is related to medications like probenecid, which is used to treat gout by increasing uric acid excretion, but it is not typically associated with pancytopenia.

E. Recombinant enzyme: This mechanism is not related to gout treatment or prevention.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, which describes the mechanism of allopurinol.",Success
"A 59-year-old man complains of chest pain that has been present for 4 hours on the 5th day of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. 5 days ago, he had a burning sensation in his chest and discomfort in his left shoulder. Upon initial presentation to the hospital’s emergency department, he was diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and treated with alteplase. He has been under close observation since then. The patient now describes discomfort in his chest and left shoulder, somewhat similar in nature to what initially brought him into the hospital. A pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and a blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg are observed. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings. The patient’s ECG is difficult to interpret. Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility?",C,"The correct answer is C. Creatine kinase (CK-MB).

Here's why:

The patient is experiencing chest pain and discomfort in the left shoulder, similar to their initial symptoms, which suggests a possible re-infarction or extension of the initial myocardial infarction. Given the patient's history of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and treatment with alteplase, the focus is on diagnosing a potential new or ongoing myocardial injury.

Among the options, creatine kinase (CK-MB) is the most specific and sensitive biomarker for myocardial injury. CK-MB is an isoenzyme of creatine kinase that is primarily found in the heart muscle. Elevated levels of CK-MB in the blood are a strong indicator of myocardial damage or infarction.

In this scenario, an abnormal result of CK-MB would have the most diagnostic utility in determining whether the patient is experiencing a re-infarction or extension of the initial myocardial infarction. Elevated CK-MB levels would support the diagnosis of ongoing myocardial injury, guiding further management and treatment.

The other options are not as specific or sensitive for diagnosing myocardial injury:

A. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is a liver enzyme that can be elevated in various conditions, including liver disease, but it is not specific to myocardial injury.

B. Alkaline phosphatase is a nonspecific enzyme that can be elevated in various conditions, including bone, liver, or kidney disease, but it is not a reliable marker for myocardial injury.

D. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a nonspecific enzyme that can be elevated in various conditions, including myocardial infarction, but it is not as specific or sensitive as CK-MB.

E. Troponin T is a cardiac biomarker that can be elevated in myocardial injury, but it may not be as specific as CK-MB in this scenario, especially given the patient's recent alteplase treatment, which can affect troponin levels.

In summary, CK-MB is the most diagnostic biomarker for myocardial injury in this scenario, and an abnormal result would have the most diagnostic utility in guiding further management and treatment.",Success

She ignored it initially as she thought it was just a bruise, but the pain and swelling worsened throughout the day. The analgesic spray she used did not provide adequate relief. There is no family history of serious illness. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive pill. Her immunizations are up-to-date. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37.1°C (99°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg. Examination shows a swollen and tender left wrist; range of motion is limited. The anatomical snuffbox is tender to palpation. The grip strength of the left hand is decreased. The thumb can be opposed towards the other fingers. Finkelstein's test is negative. X-rays of the wrist shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Thumb spica cast and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a scaphoid fracture, which is a common injury in young adults, especially after a fall onto an outstretched hand. The tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox, a region located on the radial aspect of the wrist, is a key indicator of a scaphoid fracture. Although the initial X-rays did not show any abnormalities, scaphoid fractures can be difficult to diagnose on initial radiographs, and up to 20% of scaphoid fractures may not be visible on initial X-rays.

Given the high suspicion of a scaphoid fracture, the most appropriate next step is to immobilize the wrist in a thumb spica cast and repeat X-rays in 2 weeks. This allows for further evaluation and potential diagnosis of a scaphoid fracture, which may become more apparent on follow-up radiographs.

The other options are not appropriate at this stage:

A. Open reduction and internal fixation is a surgical intervention that may be necessary for a displaced scaphoid fracture, but it's not the initial management step.

B. Corticosteroid injections are not indicated for the management of a suspected scaphoid fracture.

D. Rest, ice, and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks may not provide adequate immobilization and may delay diagnosis and treatment.

E. Percutaneous pinning is a surgical intervention that may be necessary for a scaphoid fracture, but it's not the initial management step.

It's essential to note that a scaphoid fracture can lead to long-term complications, such as osteonecrosis and arthritis, if not properly diagnosed and treated. Therefore, a high index of suspicion and appropriate management are crucial in this case.",Success
"A 46-year-old man comes to the physician with a 1-week history of yellowish discoloration of his eyes, generalized fatigue, and pruritus. He was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 7 years ago. At the time of diagnosis, a pANCA test was also positive. Physical examination shows scleral icterus and multiple scratch marks on the trunk and extremities. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Serum studies show a total bilirubin concentration of 3.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin concentration of 2.5 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase level of 450 U/L. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography shows focal areas of intrahepatic bile duct strictures alternating with areas of dilation. Histologic examination of a liver biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?",A,"The correct answer is A. Periductal concentric scarring and fibrosis.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. The presence of ulcerative colitis and a positive pANCA test further support this diagnosis, as PSC is often associated with inflammatory bowel disease.

The magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) findings of focal areas of intrahepatic bile duct strictures alternating with areas of dilation are also consistent with PSC.

On liver biopsy, the characteristic histologic finding in PSC is periductal concentric scarring and fibrosis, which is option A. This is due to the inflammation and fibrosis of the bile ducts, leading to the formation of concentric layers of fibrous tissue around the ducts.

The other options are not consistent with PSC:

B. Periportal lymphocytic infiltration and piecemeal necrosis are more characteristic of chronic hepatitis, such as autoimmune hepatitis.

C. Diffuse fibrosis with PAS-staining globules is more consistent with liver fibrosis due to other causes, such as viral hepatitis or metabolic disorders.

D. Irregular ductal glands lined by atypical and pleomorphic cells are more characteristic of cholangiocarcinoma, a malignant tumor of the bile ducts.

E. Ductopenia and fibrotic degeneration of periportal hepatocytes are not specific findings in PSC and may be seen in other liver diseases.

Therefore, option A is the most likely histologic finding in this patient's liver biopsy specimen.",Success

She has had 5 sexual partners in the past year and uses the pull-out method for contraception. She has a 10-pack-year smoking history and drinks 10-12 alcoholic beverages per week. On exam, she has an ulcerated, tender, and purulent ulcer on the left labia majora. The patient has mild unilateral painful inguinal lymphadenopathy. This patient's condition is most likely caused by which of the following pathogens?",C,"The correct answer is C. Haemophilus ducreyi.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with chancroid, a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. The characteristics of chancroid include:

* Painful and swollen genital ulcers
* Ulceration with a purulent base
* Tender and swollen inguinal lymph nodes (bubo)
* History of recent sexual contact with multiple partners
* Absence of vaginal discharge

Chancroid is a common cause of genital ulcers in developing countries, but it is less common in the United States. However, it should be considered in patients with a history of high-risk sexual behavior, as in this case.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

A. Klebsiella granulomatis: This bacterium causes donovanosis, a rare STI characterized by painless, bleeding ulcers. The patient's symptoms do not match this description.

B. Herpes simplex virus type 2: While herpes can cause genital ulcers, the patient's symptoms are not typical of herpes, which often presents with multiple, shallow, and painful ulcers. The patient's unilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy is also more consistent with chancroid.

D. Gardnerella vaginalis: This bacterium is associated with bacterial vaginosis, which typically presents with a fishy odor, itching, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient denies vaginal discharge, making this option unlikely.

E. Treponema pallidum: This bacterium causes syphilis, which can present with genital ulcers. However, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with primary syphilis, which typically presents with a painless chancre. The patient's unilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy is also more consistent with chancroid.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, Haemophilus ducreyi is the most likely cause of her condition.",Success

On many occasions, his mind will be racing with thoughts that keep him up at night. During these moments, he finds his heart racing and feels light-headed and dizzy to the point of blacking out. He has also been experiencing back and neck pain with increased muscle tension in these areas. The patient reports no smoking or alcohol use but mentions that he had tried cocaine and heroin in his 20s and 30s. Which of the following would be the best course of treatment for this patient’s symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Buspirone.

The patient's symptoms, including feelings of nervousness, anxiety, restlessness, and racing thoughts, are consistent with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The presence of physical symptoms such as heart racing, lightheadedness, and muscle tension in the back and neck also support this diagnosis.

Buspirone is a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic medication that is specifically approved for the treatment of GAD. It has a slower onset of action compared to benzodiazepines, but it is less likely to cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Buspirone is also less sedating and has a lower risk of abuse compared to benzodiazepines.

Diazepam (A) is a benzodiazepine that can be effective for anxiety, but it has a higher risk of dependence and withdrawal symptoms, especially in older adults. It is also not specifically approved for GAD.

Zolpidem (B) is a sedative-hypnotic medication that is approved for insomnia, not anxiety.

Ramelteon (C) is a melatonin receptor agonist that is approved for insomnia, not anxiety.

Alprazolam (E) is a benzodiazepine that can be effective for anxiety, but it has a higher risk of dependence and withdrawal symptoms, especially in older adults. It is also not specifically approved for GAD.

The patient's history of substance abuse in the past is a concern, and benzodiazepines may not be the best choice due to their potential for abuse and dependence. Buspirone is a safer option in this case.",Success
"Two hours after undergoing open cholecystectomy for complicated cholecystitis, a 48-year-old woman develops dizziness, lethargy, abdominal pain, and nausea. She has systemic lupus erythematosus and hypertension. Prior to hospitalization, her medications included nifedipine and prednisolone. Her pulse is 112/min and blood pressure is 90/64 mm Hg. Examination shows central obesity. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and the laparoscopic incisions have no discharge. Her serum cortisol and serum ACTH are decreased. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Hyponatremia.

The patient's symptoms, such as dizziness, lethargy, abdominal pain, and nausea, along with the physical examination findings, suggest adrenal insufficiency. The decreased serum cortisol and ACTH levels support this diagnosis. Adrenal insufficiency can occur in patients with chronic steroid use, such as prednisolone, who undergo a stressful event like surgery.

In adrenal insufficiency, the most common electrolyte abnormality is hyponatremia (low sodium levels). This is because the adrenal glands produce aldosterone, a hormone that helps regulate sodium and potassium levels. Without sufficient aldosterone, sodium levels can drop, leading to hyponatremia.

The other options are not directly related to adrenal insufficiency:

A. Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis is not typically associated with adrenal insufficiency.

B. Hyperkalemia (high potassium levels) is possible in adrenal insufficiency due to the lack of aldosterone, but it's not the most likely finding.

C. Hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) is not directly related to adrenal insufficiency, although cortisol does play a role in glucose metabolism.

D. Hypernatremia (high sodium levels) is the opposite of what would be expected in adrenal insufficiency.

Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient is hyponatremia (E).",Success
"A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks of gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. The patient has attended many prenatal appointments and followed her physician's advice about screening for diseases, laboratory testing, diet, and exercise. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. She has no history of a serious illness. Her first child was delivered via normal vaginal delivery. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Cervical examination shows 100% effacement and 10 cm dilation. A cardiotocograph is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",C,"The correct answer is D. Repositioning.

The cardiotocograph (CTG) shows a non-reassuring fetal heart rate (NRFHR) pattern, specifically a variable deceleration. This type of deceleration is caused by umbilical cord compression, which can occur when the umbilical cord becomes compressed between the fetus and the mother's pelvis or the uterine wall.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that the initial step in managing a NRFHR pattern is to attempt to resolve the underlying cause. In this case, the most likely cause is umbilical cord compression due to the fetus's position. Repositioning the mother to relieve the compression is a simple and non-invasive intervention that may resolve the NRFHR pattern.

Reassurance (option C) is not appropriate as the CTG shows a NRFHR pattern that requires intervention. Induced vaginal delivery (option B) is not indicated as the patient is already in active labor and there is no indication for augmentation of labor. Amnioinfusion (option A) may be considered if the NRFHR pattern persists despite repositioning, but it is not the initial step in management. Urgent cesarean delivery (option E) may be necessary if the NRFHR pattern persists and fetal distress is suspected, but it is not the initial step in management.

It's worth noting that the patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and she has no history of serious illness, which suggests that she is a low-risk patient. However, the NRFHR pattern requires prompt attention to ensure fetal well-being.",Success
"A 63-year-old female complains of weakness, light-headedness, palpitations, and soreness of the tongue. She has a past medical history of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Her hematocrit is 29%. On peripheral blood smear, you notice neutrophils with 7 lobes and large oval-shaped red blood cells. On physical exam, you notice the patient has decreased position sense and a loss in vibratory sensation in her lower extremities. Which of the following is most likely present in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency. The presence of neutrophils with 7 lobes (hypersegmented neutrophils) and large oval-shaped red blood cells (macrocytes) on the peripheral blood smear suggests megaloblastic anemia, which is a hallmark of vitamin B12 deficiency.

The patient's past medical history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis increases the likelihood of pernicious anemia, an autoimmune disorder that causes vitamin B12 deficiency due to the production of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies. These antibodies destroy the gastric parietal cells that produce intrinsic factor, a protein necessary for vitamin B12 absorption.

The patient's symptoms of weakness, light-headedness, and palpitations are consistent with anemia, while the soreness of the tongue is likely due to glossitis, a common finding in vitamin B12 deficiency. The physical exam findings of decreased position sense and loss of vibratory sensation in the lower extremities suggest peripheral neuropathy, another common complication of vitamin B12 deficiency.

Option A, atrophy of G cells, is not directly related to vitamin B12 deficiency. Option C, decreased methylmalonic acid levels, is actually the opposite of what would be expected in vitamin B12 deficiency, as methylmalonic acid levels are typically elevated in this condition. Option D, antithrombotic state, is not related to the patient's symptoms or laboratory findings. Option E, B12 malabsorption due to Diphyllobothrium latum, is a possible cause of vitamin B12 deficiency, but it is less likely in this patient given her past medical history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and the presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to the doctor’s office with shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue for 3 days. This has been progressively worsening. He has a medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and osteoarthritis. He takes albuterol, ipratropium and aspirin. He smoked 2 and a half packs per day, and had done so for the past 26 years. After ceasing tobacco use for 1 year, he has recently begun smoking again. The blood pressure is 138/88 mm Hg, the respiratory rate is 12/min, the heart rate is 76/min, and the pulse oximetry is 87% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appears disoriented and is only somewhat comprehensible. The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light with extraocular movements intact. Cranial nerves VII-XII also intact. The auscultation of the heart is absent of murmur, rubs, or gallops. The auscultation of the lungs demonstrate audible rales in the bases bilaterally. Which of the stages of change is the patient currently experiencing based on the clinical vignette?",E,"The correct answer is E. Relapse.

The stages of change model, also known as the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), is a widely used framework to understand the process of behavior change, particularly in the context of addiction. The stages of change are:

1. Precontemplation: The individual is not aware of the need to change their behavior.
2. Contemplation: The individual is aware of the need to change, but is weighing the pros and cons of doing so.
3. Preparation: The individual is preparing to make a change, often by setting a quit date or seeking resources.
4. Action: The individual is actively making changes to their behavior.
5. Maintenance: The individual is working to maintain the changes they have made.
6. Relapse: The individual returns to their old behavior after attempting to change.

In this clinical vignette, the patient had quit smoking for 1 year but has recently started smoking again. This indicates that the patient had previously progressed to the Action or Maintenance stage, but has now returned to their old behavior, which is characteristic of the Relapse stage.

It's worth noting that the patient's current symptoms and presentation are not directly related to the stages of change, but rather to their underlying medical conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is likely exacerbated by their recent return to smoking.",Success
"A 28-year-old man reports to his physician that he is having second thoughts about his long-term compatibility with his wife ever since they relocated to a new city. He admits that he has noticed himself flirting with some of the female co-workers at his new workplace. When he goes on a dinner date with his wife after work one evening, he accuses her of giving their waiter flirtatious looks and asks her whether she has been cheating on him or trying to spend time with other men. The man’s actions are most consistent with which of the following psychological defense mechanisms?",C,"The correct answer is C. Projection.

The patient's behavior is consistent with projection, a psychological defense mechanism in which an individual attributes their own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or impulses to someone else. In this case, the patient is accusing his wife of flirting with the waiter and potentially cheating on him, when in reality, he is the one who has been flirting with female co-workers and having doubts about his relationship.

By accusing his wife of infidelity, the patient is deflecting attention away from his own behavior and projecting his own feelings of guilt and insecurity onto her. This defense mechanism allows him to avoid taking responsibility for his actions and instead shift the focus onto his wife's perceived wrongdoing.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Displacement involves redirecting emotions or impulses from the original source to a more acceptable or less threatening target. While the patient is redirecting his attention to his wife, it's not a displacement of emotions, but rather a projection of his own thoughts and feelings.

B. Dissociation is a defense mechanism in which an individual disconnects from their thoughts, feelings, or experiences. There is no evidence of dissociation in this scenario.

D. Reaction formation involves adopting behaviors or attitudes that are opposite of one's true feelings. The patient is not exhibiting reaction formation, as he is not pretending to be overly faithful or committed to his wife.

E. Repression involves pushing uncomfortable thoughts or memories into the unconscious mind. While the patient may be repressing his own feelings of guilt or shame, the primary defense mechanism at play is projection.",Success
"A 25-year-old, G2P2L2 woman presents with a complaint of missed menstrual cycle for 4 weeks. Her previous menstrual cycles were regular, occurring every 28–35 days consistently. The patient does not have any other complaints currently. Her past medical history reveals two uncomplicated and normal vaginal deliveries at term. She has a 2-year-old boy and a 6-month-old girl. The patient and her partner use the withdrawal method for contraception. The urine pregnancy test result is positive. The patient returns to the clinic after 1 week expressing her desire to discontinue with the pregnancy and inquires about the possibility of an elective abortion. Which of the following procedures is the most appropriate for elective termination of pregnancy in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is C. Manual uterine aspiration.

Justification:

The patient is 5 weeks pregnant, as indicated by the 4-week missed menstrual cycle. At this gestational age, manual uterine aspiration (MUA) is the most appropriate procedure for elective termination of pregnancy.

Manual uterine aspiration is a safe and effective method for terminating pregnancies up to 6-7 weeks of gestation. It involves using a handheld suction device to gently remove the pregnancy tissue from the uterus. MUA is a quick procedure, typically taking around 5-10 minutes, and can be performed in an outpatient setting.

Option A, dilatation and evacuation (D&E), is typically used for pregnancies beyond 12-14 weeks of gestation.

Option B, oxytocin-induced labor, is not a suitable option for elective termination of pregnancy, as it is usually used to induce labor in women who are near or past their due date.

Option D, dilatation and curettage (D&C) after vacuum evacuation, is not necessary in this case, as MUA is a sufficient procedure for terminating a pregnancy at 5 weeks.

Option E, oral mifepristone + misoprostol, is a medication abortion regimen, which may not be suitable for this patient, as she is already 5 weeks pregnant. Mifepristone is typically used up to 49 days of gestation, and the efficacy decreases with increasing gestational age.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), MUA is a recommended method for early pregnancy termination, and it is considered a safe and effective option for women up to 6-7 weeks of gestation.",Success
"A 77-year-old man comes to your office for a routine visit. He is doing well, and his only complaint is the recent appearance of several brown greasy appearing lesions on his forehead (figure A) that he can't seem to peel off. What is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Seborrheic keratosis.

The description of the lesions as ""brown, greasy appearing"" and the patient's inability to peel them off are consistent with seborrheic keratoses. These benign skin growths are common in older adults and typically appear as dark brown or black, greasy, or waxy patches or plaques on the face, neck, or torso. They are often mistaken for melanoma, but they do not have the same characteristics as melanoma, such as asymmetry, irregular borders, or multiple colors.

Seborrheic keratoses are caused by a benign proliferation of keratinocytes and are not related to sun exposure or skin cancer. They are usually asymptomatic but can be itchy or irritated if they become inflamed.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms:

A. Melanoma: While melanoma can appear as a brown or black lesion, it typically has asymmetry, irregular borders, and multiple colors, which are not described in this patient.

C. Keloid: Keloids are raised, firm, and shiny scars that form as a result of abnormal wound healing. They are not typically brown or greasy in appearance.

D. Acanthosis nigricans: This is a skin condition characterized by dark, velvety patches on the skin, often in the armpits, neck, or groin area. While it can appear brown or black, it is not typically described as ""greasy"" or ""waxy.""

E. Erythema nodosum: This is a skin condition characterized by painful, red, or purple bumps or nodules, typically on the shins. It is not consistent with the patient's description of brown, greasy lesions on the forehead.

"A 72-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a 6-month history of shortness of breath. He says that he used to enjoy playing golf with his friends but now he cannot walk for long enough to play. The shortness of breath is now starting to complicate his ability to get around in daily life. His past medical history is significant for diabetes, hypertension, and early stage prostate cancer that was removed 10 years ago without recurrence. He has smoked 1 pack per day for the past 55 years and drinks about 6 drinks per week. On presentation he is found to be breathing with pursed lips. Physical exam reveals decreased breath sounds on auscultation, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion. Which of the following findings would most likely be seen in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's 55-year history of smoking is a significant risk factor for COPD, and the physical exam findings of decreased breath sounds, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion are all characteristic of COPD.

In COPD, the lungs become less efficient at exchanging air, leading to air trapping and hyperinflation. This results in an increase in residual volume (RV), which is the amount of air remaining in the lungs after a full exhalation.

The 1-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) is a measure of lung function that assesses the amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled from the lungs in 1 second. In COPD, the FEV1 is typically decreased due to the obstruction of airflow.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume, which is consistent with the diagnosis of COPD.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Decreased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume would be more consistent with a restrictive lung disease, such as pulmonary fibrosis.

B. Decreased residual volume and increased 1 second forced expiratory volume is not a typical finding in COPD.

D. Increased residual volume and increased 1 second forced expiratory volume would suggest normal or near-normal lung function, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings.

E. Normal residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume would not fully capture the extent of lung hyperinflation and air trapping seen in COPD.",Success
"A 67-year-old male comes into the ED complaining of dyspnea and a heavy feeling in his chest. He reports that over the past month he has become more easily “winded"" to the point that he now sleeps in his living room because he can’t make it up the stairs. A review of systems is notable for headaches and fatigue. On physical exam you note decreased breath sounds and a dullness to percussion on the right. A chest radiograph is obtained, which shows a right-sided pleural effusion. Thoracocentesis is performed and the fluid is analyzed, with results shown below:

Volume: 30 cc of fluid
Pleural fluid protein: 5.8 g/dL
Serum protein ratio: 7.0 g/dL
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 258 U/L

Which of the following conditions may have led to the findings in this patient’s pleural cavity?",D,"The correct answer is A. Congestive heart failure.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as dyspnea and fatigue, are consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). The physical exam findings, including decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion on the right, suggest a pleural effusion. The thoracocentesis results support this diagnosis.

The pleural fluid analysis shows a protein level of 5.8 g/dL, which is relatively low. The serum protein ratio is 7.0 g/dL, which indicates that the fluid is a transudate. Transudates are typically seen in conditions that alter the balance of hydrostatic and oncotic pressures, such as CHF.

The LDH level of 258 U/L is also consistent with a transudate. In exudates, LDH levels are typically higher (> 200 IU/L).

The other options are less likely:

B. Hypoalbuminemia: While hypoalbuminemia can cause a transudative effusion, it would not typically cause the patient's symptoms or the physical exam findings.

C. Liver cirrhosis: Cirrhosis can cause a transudative effusion, but it would typically be accompanied by other signs of liver disease, such as ascites, jaundice, or coagulopathy.

D. Lymphoma: Lymphoma can cause a pleural effusion, but it would typically be an exudate with a higher protein level and LDH level.

E. Nephrotic syndrome: Nephrotic syndrome can cause a transudative effusion, but it would typically be accompanied by other signs of kidney disease, such as proteinuria, edema, or hypertension.

In summary, the patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and pleural fluid analysis results are most consistent with congestive heart failure as the underlying cause of the pleural effusion.",Success
"A 29-year-old G4P0 woman presents following a spontaneous pregnancy loss in the 18th week of her pregnancy.

K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL

Which of the following tests is most likely to elucidate the cause of this patient's pregnancy losses?",C,"The correct answer is C. Hysterosalpingogram.

The patient's history of recurrent second-trimester pregnancy losses and the finding of a firm, asymmetric uterus on physical examination suggest a possible anatomical abnormality of the uterus. A hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is a diagnostic test that uses X-ray and contrast dye to visualize the uterus and fallopian tubes. It is commonly used to evaluate uterine abnormalities, such as septate uterus, bicornuate uterus, or uterine fibroids, which can increase the risk of pregnancy loss.

While the other options may be relevant in certain contexts, they are less likely to elucidate the cause of this patient's pregnancy losses:

A. Anti-cardiolipin antibodies are associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, which can cause recurrent pregnancy loss. However, this test is more relevant in the context of thrombotic events or autoimmune disorders, which are not suggested by the patient's history or laboratory results.

B. Karyotyping may be useful in evaluating chromosomal abnormalities, but it is more relevant in the context of recurrent miscarriage in the first trimester, rather than second-trimester losses.

D. Prolactin level is relevant in the evaluation of galactorrhea or amenorrhea, but it is not directly related to recurrent pregnancy loss.

E. TSH level is relevant in the evaluation of thyroid dysfunction, which can affect fertility and pregnancy outcomes. However, it is not a primary cause of recurrent second-trimester pregnancy loss.

In this case, a hysterosalpingogram is the most likely test to provide information about potential uterine abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's recurrent pregnancy losses.",Success
"A 22-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician in April for seasonal allergies. She has suffered from seasonal allergies for the past 2 years and takes diphenhydramine as needed when her symptoms worsen. She has not yet seen a physician for her allergies. She reports that diphenhydramine has been helpful in controlling her symptoms, but she does not like feeling drowsy from the medication. Her past medical history is also notable for well-controlled asthma. She uses an albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis. She smokes marijuana daily. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 16/min. She has a prominent nasal crease. Her nasal turbinates are boggy and bluish-gray. She has copious thin and watery nasal mucus. The physician suggests replacing diphenhydramine with fexofenadine to improve her drowsiness. What characteristic of fexodenadine allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine?",D,"The correct answer is D. Relative lipophobicity.

Fexofenadine is a second-generation antihistamine, which means it is less likely to cause sedation compared to first-generation antihistamines like diphenhydramine. The reason for this is that fexofenadine has a lower ability to cross the blood-brain barrier due to its relative lipophobicity (low lipid solubility). This reduces its penetration into the central nervous system, resulting in fewer sedating effects.

In contrast, diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, leading to more significant sedation and drowsiness.

The other options are not directly related to the sedating effects of fexofenadine:

A. Alpha-adrenergic antagonism is a property of some medications that can cause vasodilation and hypotension, but it's not relevant to sedation.

B. Beta-adrenergic antagonism is a property of beta blockers, which are used to treat conditions like hypertension and heart failure, but it's not related to sedation or antihistamines.

C. Muscarinic antagonism is a property of some medications that can cause anticholinergic effects, such as dry mouth and urinary retention, but it's not directly related to sedation.

E. Serotonergic antagonism is a property of some medications that can affect serotonin levels, but it's not relevant to the sedating effects of fexofenadine.

By switching to fexofenadine, the physician aims to provide the patient with a more targeted and less sedating treatment for her seasonal allergies.",Success
"A 55-year-old male visited his primary care physician complaining of chest pain and progressive shortness of breath worsened by exertion. His vital signs were within normal limits. He reports that he worked in a naval shipyard for 10 years during his twenties. A CT scan of his chest shows diffuse thickening of the pleura and a diagnosis of mesothelioma is made. Assuming this diagnosis is correct, which of the following is most likely to also be present in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Pleural effusion.

Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that affects the thin layer of tissue that lines the lungs, abdomen, or heart, known as the mesothelium. The most common type of mesothelioma is pleural mesothelioma, which affects the lining of the lungs. Given the patient's history of working in a naval shipyard, where asbestos exposure is common, and the CT scan findings of diffuse thickening of the pleura, the diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma is likely.

Pleural effusion, which is the accumulation of fluid in the space between the lungs and chest wall, is a common complication of pleural mesothelioma. In fact, pleural effusion is often the initial presenting symptom of mesothelioma. The fluid accumulation can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough, which are consistent with the patient's symptoms.

The other options are not directly related to mesothelioma or are less likely to be present in this patient:

A. Pneumothorax (collapsed lung) can occur in patients with mesothelioma, but it is not a direct consequence of the disease.

C. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a condition characterized by a severe inflammatory response, which is not typically associated with mesothelioma.

D. Bronchioalveolar carcinoma is a type of lung cancer, but it is not directly related to mesothelioma.

E. Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung condition characterized by abnormal dilation of the bronchi, which is not typically associated with mesothelioma.

He has brought an gastroduodenoscopy report for review, which reveals that the patient has small esophageal varices with red spots. What is the next best step to prevent bleeding?",D,"The correct answer is D. Nadolol.

The patient has small esophageal varices with red spots, which indicates a high risk of bleeding. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends non-selective beta blockers (NSBBs) as the primary prophylaxis to prevent bleeding from esophageal varices.

Nadolol is a non-selective beta blocker that is commonly used for this indication. It has been shown to reduce the risk of bleeding from esophageal varices by decreasing portal pressure.

Endoscopic sclerotherapy (Option A) and ligation (Option B) are invasive procedures that are typically reserved for patients who have already bled from their varices or have failed medical therapy.

Metoprolol (Option C) is a selective beta-1 blocker that is not typically used for portal hypertension.

Repeat endoscopy (Option E) is not necessary at this time, as the patient has already had a recent endoscopy that revealed small esophageal varices with red spots.

It's worth noting that the patient's abstinence from alcohol and attendance at a support group are important for his overall health and liver disease management, but they do not directly address the risk of bleeding from esophageal varices.",Success
"A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife for incomprehensible speech. Upon first inspection you note the man is drooling and his eyes are tearing excessively. The patient's wife explains that the man was tilling the fields on the family beet farm when she found him collapsed on a pile of freshly picked beets. The patient seemed confused so the wife brought him in promptly, and states it has only been ten minutes since the patient was found down in the fields. Physical exam is deferred due to a confused and combative patient who is speaking clearly yet his sentences do not make any sense. The patients clothes are removed in the ED. Vital signs are currently being obtained. Which of the following is the best initial step in management?",D,"The correct answer is A. Sublingual atropine drops.

The patient's symptoms, including incomprehensible speech, drooling, and excessive tearing, are consistent with organophosphate poisoning, which is likely due to exposure to pesticides on the beet farm. The patient's wife reported that the patient was found collapsed in the fields, and the rapid onset of symptoms suggests a toxic exposure.

Atropine is an antidote for organophosphate poisoning, and sublingual administration can help counteract the muscarinic effects of the toxin, such as excessive salivation and tearing. Atropine can also help improve the patient's mental status and reduce confusion.

The other options are not the best initial step in management:

B. Neostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that can exacerbate organophosphate poisoning.

C. Physostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that can also worsen organophosphate poisoning.

D. 2-Pralidoxime (2-PAM) is an oxime that can help reactivate cholinesterase, but it should be administered in conjunction with atropine, not as a single agent.

E. Intubation may be necessary later, but it is not the initial step in management. The patient's airway is not currently compromised, and atropine administration can help improve the patient's symptoms before considering intubation.

It's essential to note that the patient's vital signs should be closely monitored, and further management should involve supportive care, decontamination, and possibly additional antidotes, such as 2-PAM, under the guidance of a toxicologist or poison control center.",Success
"A 75-year-old man presents to the physician for his annual blood pressure visit and blood work. He has no complaints other than occasional knee pain. The past medical history includes hypertension.

He had a brother who died at the age of 84 due to hematologic malignancy. The temperature is 36.8℃ (98.2℉), and the blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. The physical examination shows no abnormalities other than a reduced range of motion and crepitus in both knees. The laboratory test results are as follows:
Hemoglobin 15 g/dL
Leukocyte count 58,000/mm3
Platelet count 250,000/mm3
Flow cytometry on the peripheral blood reveals an absolute lymphocyte count of 50,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

Here's why:

* The patient's laboratory results show a low-grade fever (36.8°C), which is not a significant finding in this case.
* The blood pressure is well-controlled, which is consistent with the patient's history of hypertension.
* The physical examination reveals reduced range of motion and crepitus in both knees, consistent with osteoarthritis.
* The laboratory results show a significantly elevated leukocyte count (58,000/mm³), which is a key finding.
* The flow cytometry on peripheral blood reveals an absolute lymphocyte count of 50,000/mm³, which is also a crucial finding.

Given these results, the most likely diagnosis is Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). CLL is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, characterized by an abnormal increase in lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The absolute lymphocyte count of 50,000/mm³ is consistent with CLL, as it indicates a significant increase in lymphocytes in the peripheral blood.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

* B. Monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a precursor condition to CLL, but it typically presents with a lower absolute lymphocyte count (<5,000/mm³).
* C. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a condition characterized by the presence of a monoclonal protein (M-protein) in the blood or urine, but it is not associated with an elevated leukocyte count or absolute lymphocyte count.
* D. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow, but it typically presents with anemia, bone pain, and elevated calcium levels, which are not seen in this patient.
* E. Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an overproduction of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. While the patient's platelet count is elevated, the primary finding of an elevated leukocyte count and absolute lymphocyte count is more consistent with CLL.

Therefore, based on the laboratory results and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).",Success
A 60-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of cough productive of yellow sputum with occasional streaks of blood. He has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. He is afebrile. Pulmonary examination shows inspiratory crackles at the left infraclavicular area. An x-ray of his chest shows a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning. A sputum sample does not grow acid-fast bacteria despite multiple cultures. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?,D,"The correct answer is C. Neoplastic transformation.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as a 2-month history of cough productive of yellow sputum with occasional streaks of blood, are consistent with a lung mass. The chest x-ray showing a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning suggests a mobile mass, which is likely to be a lung tumor. The patient's history of pulmonary tuberculosis increases the risk of developing lung cancer.

The fact that the sputum sample does not grow acid-fast bacteria despite multiple cultures rules out active tuberculosis. The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings:

A. Hypersensitivity reaction is unlikely to cause a radiopaque mass on a chest x-ray.

B. Asbestos inhalation can cause pleural plaques or mesothelioma, but it is not typically associated with a mobile lung mass.

D. Opportunistic colonization is unlikely to cause a radiopaque mass on a chest x-ray, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a colonized lung infection.

E. Abscess formation would likely cause a fever, which is not present in this patient.

Neoplastic transformation, or lung cancer, is the most likely cause of this patient's condition, given the symptoms and radiographic findings.",Success
"An 11-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother after she observed jerking movements of his arms and legs for about 30 seconds earlier that morning. He has not had fever, cough, or a runny nose. He has been healthy, except for occasional eczema. He was delivered at home in Romania. His mother had no prenatal care. She reports that he has required more time to reach developmental milestones compared to his older brother. The patient's immunization records are not available. He takes no medications. He appears pale with blue eyes and has a musty odor. He has poor eye contact. Which of the following would have most likely prevented the patient's symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine.

The patient's symptoms, including jerking movements, pale skin, blue eyes, musty odor, and poor eye contact, are consistent with phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is necessary to break down the amino acid phenylalanine, which is found in many protein-rich foods.

PKU can cause intellectual disability, seizures, and behavioral problems if left untreated. The treatment for PKU is a lifelong dietary restriction of phenylalanine, which can help prevent these symptoms.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms:

A. Levothyroxine therapy during pregnancy would be relevant for hypothyroidism, not PKU.

C. Daily allopurinol intake is used to treat gout or kidney stones, not PKU.

D. Avoidance of fasting states is important for certain metabolic disorders, such as glycogen storage diseases, but not PKU.

E. High doses of vitamin B6 are sometimes used to treat seizures or other neurological disorders, but it is not a treatment for PKU.

It's worth noting that the patient's lack of prenatal care and unknown immunization records may have contributed to the delay in diagnosis and treatment of PKU, which is typically detected through newborn screening.",Success
A researcher hypothesizes that low birth weight is related to obesity later in life. He conducts a study with a 95% confidence interval with a p-value of 0.049 to disprove his null hypothesis. He rejects his null hypothesis and concludes that low birth weight is associated with obesity. Which of the following statements best associates with his study?,B,"The correct answer is E. A type 1 error has been made.

Here's why:

The researcher conducted a study with a 95% confidence interval and obtained a p-value of 0.049, which is just below the typical significance level of 0.05. Based on this result, the researcher rejected the null hypothesis and concluded that low birth weight is associated with obesity.

However, with a p-value of 0.049, there is a 4.9% chance of obtaining the observed result (or a more extreme result) assuming that the null hypothesis is true. This means that there is a small probability that the observed association between low birth weight and obesity is due to chance rather than a real effect.

In this case, the researcher has rejected the null hypothesis, but there is a possibility that the null hypothesis is actually true, and the observed association is a false positive. This is known as a type 1 error, which occurs when a researcher rejects a true null hypothesis.

The other options are not correct:

A. The choice of a 95% confidence interval is arbitrary, but it is a common and reasonable choice. There is no reason to suggest that a 90% confidence interval would be more appropriate.

B. A type 2 error is possible in this case. A type 2 error occurs when a researcher fails to reject a false null hypothesis. Even though the researcher rejected the null hypothesis, it's possible that the null hypothesis is actually false, and the researcher would have failed to detect the true association if the sample size were smaller or the effect size were smaller.

C. The researcher's decision to reject the null hypothesis is based on the p-value, which is below the significance level. There is no reason to suggest that the null hypothesis should not have been rejected.

D. There is no evidence to suggest that a type 2 error has been made. The researcher rejected the null hypothesis, which means that they detected an association between low birth weight and obesity. A type 2 error would occur if the researcher failed to detect an association when one exists.",Success
"A 52-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for abdominal pain and diarrhea. The patient states that she has been experiencing watery diarrhea for weeks now. During this same period she states she has been constantly thirsty and does not have the same energy levels that she once had. The patient has a past medical history of anxiety and depression and is currently taking fluoxetine. She was recently treated for a middle ear infection and sinusitis with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid one week ago. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 110/58 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Laboratory values are obtained and shown below.

Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL
AST: 12 U/L
ALT: 10 U/L

Which of the following is associated with the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is E. Normal flora destruction.

Based on the patient's symptoms of watery diarrhea, thirst, and fatigue, along with the laboratory values, the most likely diagnosis is antibiotic-associated diarrhea caused by Clostridioides difficile (C. diff). The recent use of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for the treatment of a middle ear infection and sinusitis is a strong risk factor for C. diff infection.

The destruction of normal flora in the gut, particularly the disruption of the balance of the gut microbiome, is a key factor in the development of C. diff infection. The antibiotic treatment likely disrupted the normal flora, allowing C. diff to overgrow and produce toxins that cause diarrhea.

The other options are not directly related to the most likely diagnosis:

A. Enterotoxin: While C. diff produces toxins, including enterotoxins, this option is too general and does not specifically relate to the diagnosis.

B. Impaired iron absorption: There is no indication of iron deficiency or impaired iron absorption in the patient's laboratory values or symptoms.

C. Increased serotonin production: The patient's use of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), may affect serotonin levels, but this is not directly related to the diagnosis of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

D. Invasive bacterial infection: While the patient was recently treated for a middle ear infection and sinusitis, there is no indication of an invasive bacterial infection in the current presentation.

It's worth noting that the patient's laboratory values, such as the low potassium level (2.9 mEq/L) and elevated BUN (25 mg/dL) and creatinine (1.4 mg/dL), may be related to the diarrhea and dehydration, but they do not point to a specific diagnosis.",Success
"A 3-week-old newborn is brought to the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but the patient often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Rectal suction biopsy.

The patient's symptoms, physical examination, and radiographic findings are consistent with Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon. The presence of a dilated colon followed by a segment without stool or air on the x-ray suggests a transition zone, which is a hallmark of Hirschsprung's disease. The explosive release of stool from the rectum during the rectal exam also supports this diagnosis.

A rectal suction biopsy is the most sensitive and specific test to confirm the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease. It involves taking a small tissue sample from the rectal mucosa, which is then examined for the presence of ganglion cells. The absence of ganglion cells in the biopsy specimen confirms the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease.

The other options are not as specific or sensitive for diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease:

A. CT scan of the abdomen: While a CT scan may show a dilated colon, it is not a specific test for Hirschsprung's disease and may not show the characteristic transition zone.

B. Transabdominal ultrasonography: Ultrasonography may show a dilated colon, but it is not as sensitive or specific as a rectal suction biopsy for diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease.

C. Barium enema: A barium enema may show a transition zone, but it is not as sensitive or specific as a rectal suction biopsy, and it carries a risk of complications, such as bowel perforation.

D. Anorectal manometry: Anorectal manometry is a test that measures the pressure and function of the anal sphincter and rectum. While it may be useful in evaluating anorectal function, it is not a specific test for diagnosing Hirschsprung's disease.

In summary, a rectal suction biopsy is the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease in this patient.",Success
"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive left leg pain for 2 months, which has started to interfere with his sleep. His mother has been giving him ibuprofen at night for “growing pains,” but his symptoms have not improved. One week before the pain started, the patient was hit in the thigh by a baseball, which caused his leg to become red and swollen for several days. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. His gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. A biopsy of the left femur shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Ewing sarcoma.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a malignant bone tumor. The presence of multiple lytic lesions in the femur, elevated leukocyte count, and high ESR suggest an aggressive process. The biopsy result showing small round blue cells is also characteristic of Ewing sarcoma.

Ewing sarcoma is a type of malignant bone tumor that typically affects children and adolescents. It often presents with pain, swelling, and tenderness in the affected limb. The tumor can cause systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Laboratory results may show an elevated leukocyte count and elevated ESR.

The history of trauma to the thigh one week before the onset of symptoms is likely a red herring, as Ewing sarcoma is not typically caused by trauma.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

A. Osteosarcoma: While osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor, it typically affects older children and adolescents, and the biopsy results would show spindle-shaped cells rather than small round blue cells.

B. Chondrosarcoma: Chondrosarcoma is a type of malignant cartilage tumor that typically affects adults, and the biopsy results would show cartilaginous cells rather than small round blue cells.

C. Osteochondroma: Osteochondroma is a benign bone tumor that typically affects the metaphysis of long bones. The biopsy results would show a cartilage-capped bony outgrowth rather than small round blue cells.

E. Osteoid osteoma: Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone tumor that typically affects young adults. The biopsy results would show a nidus of osteoid tissue surrounded by a zone of reactive bone rather than small round blue cells.

In conclusion, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is Ewing sarcoma.",Success
"A 55-year-old male with a history of stage I colon cancer status-post left hemicolectomy presents to your office for follow-up. You intend to discuss the results from his recent surveillance colonoscopy, which showed no remaining cancer, no polyps, and a well-healed anastmosis. During your meeting, you note that the patient is exhibiting the defense mechanism of suppression. Which of the following statements from the patient is consistent with your impression?",E,"The correct answer is E. ""I really haven't thought about the colonoscopy until today. Worrying before getting the results wasn't going to help anything.""

Suppression is a defense mechanism in which an individual consciously pushes unpleasant or anxiety-provoking thoughts or feelings out of their awareness. In this scenario, the patient's statement ""I really haven't thought about the colonoscopy until today. Worrying before getting the results wasn't going to help anything"" suggests that they have intentionally avoided thinking about the colonoscopy results or the possibility of cancer recurrence, thereby suppressing their anxiety or concerns.

Here's why the other options are not consistent with suppression:

A. This statement indicates that the patient is actively engaging with their experience and using altruism as a coping mechanism, which is a different defense mechanism.

B. This statement suggests denial, another defense mechanism, where the patient is refusing to acknowledge the possibility of cancer recurrence or the need for ongoing surveillance.

C. This statement indicates a sense of responsibility and acknowledgment of mistakes, which is not consistent with suppression.

D. This statement suggests hypochondriasis or somatization, where the patient is excessively focused on their physical symptoms and attributing them to the cancer, which is not related to suppression.

It's essential to recognize defense mechanisms in patients to provide empathetic and effective care. By acknowledging the patient's suppression, you can gently explore their concerns and address any underlying anxieties, ultimately promoting better health outcomes.",Success
"A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with severe, crushing, retrosternal chest pain for the last 45 minutes.

He is sweating profusely. The jugular venous pulse is visible 2.5 cm above the sternal angle. Auscultation reveals soft S1 and S2 heart sounds with an added S4 and bilateral inspiratory crackles at the lung bases. The electrocardiogram shows ST-elevations in leads V1 and V2. A diagnosis of an anteroseptal infarction is made. The patient was given aspirin on the way to the hospital. He is started on dopamine, morphine, nitroglycerin, and streptokinase. Which of the following would be the most concerning development over the next 24h this patient?",A,"The correct answer is C. Persistent ST-segment elevation.

Here's why:

The patient has been diagnosed with an anteroseptal infarction, which is a type of myocardial infarction (MI) affecting the anterior and septal walls of the heart. The treatment plan includes streptokinase, a thrombolytic agent aimed at dissolving the clot causing the MI.

Persistent ST-segment elevation is a concerning development in this patient because it may indicate that the thrombolytic therapy has not been effective in restoring blood flow to the affected area of the heart. This could lead to further myocardial damage, increased risk of complications, and a poorer prognosis.

The other options are not as concerning in this scenario:

A. Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) is a possible side effect of thrombolytic therapy, but it is not a specific concern in this patient with an anteroseptal infarction.

B. Easy fatigability is a common symptom in patients with MI, but it is not a specific concern in the first 24 hours.

D. Persistent inspiratory crackles may indicate pulmonary congestion or edema, which can be managed with diuretics and other medications.

E. Shortness of breath is a common symptom in patients with MI, especially those with pulmonary congestion or edema. While it requires attention, it is not as concerning as persistent ST-segment elevation in this scenario.

His past medical history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension. He drinks alcohol socially and has a 45 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 140/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 22/min. On examination, increased work of breathing is noted. The physician decides to start the patient on an additional medication that has both mucoactive and anti-oxidative properties. What is the primary mechanism of action of this medication in the lungs?",B,"The correct answer is B. Disulfide bond cleavage.

The medication being described is likely N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which has both mucoactive and anti-oxidative properties. NAC is a mucolytic agent that breaks down mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up. Its primary mechanism of action in the lungs is to cleave disulfide bonds in mucin, a glycoprotein that gives mucus its thick, viscous properties. By breaking down these bonds, NAC reduces the viscosity of mucus, making it easier to expectorate.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. DNA hydrolysis is not a mechanism of action of NAC in the lungs. While NAC has been shown to have antioxidant properties, its primary effect in the lungs is related to mucolysis, not DNA hydrolysis.

C. Endothelin-1 antagonism is a mechanism of action of certain medications used to treat pulmonary hypertension, but it is not related to NAC or its effects on mucus.

D. Osmotic hydration of airway lumen is a mechanism of action of hypertonic saline, which is sometimes used to help loosen and clear mucus from the airways. While NAC may have some osmotic effects, its primary mechanism of action is related to disulfide bond cleavage.

E. Reduction in airway surface tension is a mechanism of action of surfactant, which is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that lines the alveoli and helps to reduce the surface tension of the air-liquid interface. While NAC may have some indirect effects on airway surface tension, its primary mechanism of action is related to mucolysis, not surfactant activity.",Success

This patient's child is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?",D,"The correct answer is D. Meconium aspiration.

The patient is at 42 weeks' gestation, which is considered post-term. Post-term pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). Meconium is the first stool of a newborn, and when it is passed in utero, it can mix with the amniotic fluid. If the baby inhales this mixture during delivery, it can cause respiratory distress and even respiratory failure.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's current situation:

A. Polyhydramnios is an excessive amount of amniotic fluid, which is not mentioned in the patient's history or examination.

B. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition that can occur in newborns, but it is not specifically related to post-term pregnancy.

C. Caudal regression syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly that affects the development of the lower spine and limbs. There is no indication in the patient's history or examination that suggests this condition.

E. Placental abruption is a condition where the placenta separates from the uterus, which can cause bleeding and fetal distress. While it is a potential complication of pregnancy, it is not directly related to post-term pregnancy or the patient's current situation.

The only immunoglobulin found as a dimer has what primary function?,D,"The correct answer is D. Inhibiting bacterial adherance and colonization of mucous membranes.

The only immunoglobulin found as a dimer is IgA, specifically secretory IgA (sIgA). sIgA is the primary immunoglobulin found in mucosal surfaces, such as the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tracts. Its primary function is to inhibit bacterial adherence and colonization of mucous membranes, thereby preventing infection.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. IgE is primarily involved in protecting against invasive helminth infections, not IgA.

B. While IgA does provide some protection against viral infections, it is not its primary function.

C. IgM provides the initial humoral immune response to newly presenting bacterial antigens, not IgA.

E. IgG provides the most specific recognition to circulating antigens in the bloodstream, but IgA is not primarily involved in this function.

An arterial blood gas sample reveals:
pH 7.26
Pco2 70 mm Hg
HCO3-  26 mEq/L
Which of the following could explain this patient's presentation?",E,"The correct answer is E. Opioid overdose.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation is consistent with opioid overdose:

1. Unresponsiveness to voice and touch, but showing a flexor response to pain, suggests a depressed level of consciousness.
2. Shallow breathing and a respiratory rate of 7/min indicate respiratory depression, which is a hallmark of opioid overdose.
3. Constricted pupils are a classic sign of opioid toxicity.
4. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a respiratory acidosis, with a pH of 7.26 and a Pco2 of 70 mm Hg, indicating that the patient is not breathing adequately, leading to a buildup of CO2 in the blood.

The other options can be ruled out based on the ABG results and the patient's presentation:

A. COPD exacerbation: While COPD can cause respiratory acidosis, the patient's pH and Pco2 levels are not consistent with a chronic respiratory condition. Additionally, the patient's constricted pupils and depressed level of consciousness are not typical of COPD exacerbation.

B. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The ABG results do not show a metabolic acidosis, which is characteristic of diabetic ketoacidosis. The pH and HCO3- levels are not consistent with this diagnosis.

C. Diuretic overdose: Diuretic overdose would not typically cause respiratory depression, constricted pupils, or a respiratory acidosis.

D. Hyperventilation: Hyperventilation would cause a respiratory alkalosis, not a respiratory acidosis. The patient's ABG results are inconsistent with this diagnosis.

Please sit down so we can discuss.""

When breaking bad news to a patient, it's essential to be empathetic, clear, and sensitive to their emotional well-being. The initial statement should prepare the patient for the news and show compassion.

Option B is the most appropriate choice because it:

1. Acknowledges the gravity of the situation with ""bad news""
2. Shows empathy by asking the patient to sit down, implying a willingness to have a conversation
3. Opens the door for a discussion, allowing the patient to process the information and ask questions

The other options are not ideal for the following reasons:

A. ""Have you ever heard of pancreatic cancer?"" is not a sensitive or empathetic way to start the conversation. It may come across as abrupt or dismissive of the patient's emotional state.

C. ""Have you designated a healthcare proxy?"" is not relevant to the initial disclosure of the diagnosis and may be perceived as insensitive or premature.

D. ""We just received your test results and we have bad news to share with you. The resident will be in to explain the diagnosis to you."" is not ideal because it:

1. Delegates the responsibility of breaking bad news to someone else (the resident)
2. May create anxiety or uncertainty by delaying the explanation

E. ""Your test results are consistent with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma"" is a straightforward, factual statement, but it lacks empathy and may be overwhelming for the patient. It's essential to prepare the patient for the news and show compassion before delivering the diagnosis.

A 40-year-old man is referred to an optometrist. He complains of mild vision impairment over the last 6 months. His vision has continued to slowly deteriorate and his condition is now affecting his night driving. Past medical history is significant for well-controlled schizophrenia. He takes a low-potency typical antipsychotics and a multivitamin every day. He has been compliant with his medication and has regular follow-up visits. What is the best first step in the management of this patient’s symptoms?,E,"The correct answer is E. Slit-lamp examination.

The patient's symptoms of mild vision impairment, particularly at night, are concerning for cataract development. Antipsychotic medications, including typical antipsychotics, are known to increase the risk of cataract formation. A slit-lamp examination is a non-invasive diagnostic tool that allows the optometrist to examine the anterior segment of the eye, including the lens, to assess for cataract formation or other potential causes of vision impairment.

Decreasing the medication dosage (Option A) may not be the best first step, as the patient's schizophrenia is well-controlled, and the medication is likely not the primary cause of the vision impairment.

Reassurance (Option B) is not sufficient, as the patient's symptoms are persistent and affecting his daily life.

Ocular examination under anesthesia (Option C) is not necessary at this stage, as it is an invasive procedure typically reserved for more complex cases or when other diagnostic methods are inconclusive.

Referring the patient to an ophthalmologist (Option D) may be premature, as a comprehensive ocular examination, including a slit-lamp examination, can be performed by an optometrist. If the optometrist suspects a more complex condition or requires further evaluation, a referral to an ophthalmologist may be necessary.

Therefore, a slit-lamp examination is the best first step in managing this patient's symptoms, as it will provide valuable information about the cause of his vision impairment and guide further management.",Success

A peripheral blood smear demonstrates hypersegmented neutrophils. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies are negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?
 ",C,"The correct answer is C. Vitamin B12 deficiency.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. The key features that support this diagnosis are:

1. Macrocytic anemia (MCV 109 fL): Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause an increase in mean corpuscular volume (MCV), leading to macrocytic anemia.
2. Hypersegmented neutrophils on peripheral blood smear: This is a characteristic finding in vitamin B12 deficiency, as it affects the maturation of neutrophils.
3. Low reticulocyte count (0.8%): Vitamin B12 is essential for erythropoiesis, and a deficiency can lead to a decreased reticulocyte count.
4. Neurological symptoms: The patient's history of repeated falls, postural dizziness, and behavioral changes (irritability, paranoia, and delusions) are consistent with the neurological manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency, which can affect the central nervous system.
5. Vegetarian diet: Vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products, so a vegetarian diet can increase the risk of deficiency.

While pernicious anemia (Option E) is a common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency, it is not the most likely cause in this scenario. Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disorder that leads to a lack of intrinsic factor, which is necessary for vitamin B12 absorption. However, the patient's laboratory results show negative anti-intrinsic factor antibodies, making pernicious anemia less likely.

Folate deficiency (Option B) can also cause macrocytic anemia, but it would not explain the patient's neurological symptoms or the presence of hypersegmented neutrophils.

Hypothyroidism (Option A) can cause fatigue, weakness, and weight loss, but it would not explain the patient's anemia, low platelet count, or neurological symptoms.

Parvovirus infection (Option D) can cause anemia, but it would not explain the patient's macrocytic anemia, hypersegmented neutrophils, or neurological symptoms.

In summary, the combination of macrocytic anemia, hypersegmented neutrophils, and neurological symptoms in a vegetarian patient makes vitamin B12 deficiency the most likely cause of this patient's condition.",Success
"A 42-year-old man presents to establish care with a family physician after having progressively worsening back pain. He has recently migrated from Sweden and has not had any checkups in the last 3 years. He first started having back pain 3 years ago, but his pain has begun to be excruciating in the mornings. He is no longer able to get relief with over the counter medications. He also feels stiff every morning and this usually lasts between 30 minutes and an hour. Both of his knees are also very painful, particularly upon standing up from a seated position. His pain improves when he moves around, so he tries to be somewhat physically active. He also reports that he cannot use his hands for long periods of time due to joint pain and stiffness. His father and sister also have joint issues, and his mother was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis. He has been a smoker for 13 years. Upon physical examination, his wrist and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are warm and swollen. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Testing for serum ESR and autoantibodies.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest an inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The key features that point to this diagnosis are:

1. Morning stiffness lasting 30 minutes to an hour, which is a characteristic feature of RA.
2. Pain and swelling in the wrists and PIP joints, which are common joints affected in RA.
3. Improvement in pain with movement, which is also consistent with RA.
4. Family history of joint issues, which increases the risk of developing RA.

Given these findings, the next best step in management would be to order laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis of RA. The most relevant tests in this scenario would be:

1. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which is a nonspecific marker of inflammation that can be elevated in RA.
2. Autoantibody tests, such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibody (anti-CCP), which are specific markers of RA.

Option A is incorrect because testing for serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) is not relevant to the patient's presenting symptoms and physical examination findings.

Option B is incorrect because while calcium and vitamin D supplementation may be important for bone health, it is not the next best step in managing the patient's symptoms.

Option D is incorrect because testing for serum ferritin is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and is more relevant to diagnosing iron deficiency anemia.

Option E is incorrect because while synovial fluid aspiration may be useful in diagnosing certain types of arthritis, it is not the next best step in this scenario.",Success
"A previously healthy 28-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of dizziness and palpitations for 2 days. Prior to the onset of the symptoms, he attended a bachelor party where he lost several drinking games. An ECG is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is C. Brugada syndrome.

The ECG shown is characteristic of Brugada syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the heart's electrical system. The ECG features a distinctive pattern of ST-segment elevation in leads V1-V3, with a coved-type ST elevation (>2 mm) in lead V2, which is a hallmark of Brugada syndrome.

Here's why the other options are not likely:

A. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) typically presents with a different ECG pattern, including left ventricular hypertrophy, septal hypertrophy, and a characteristic ""septal bump"" in leads V1-V3. The ECG shown does not support this diagnosis.

B. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) would typically present with an irregularly irregular rhythm, which is not seen in this ECG. Additionally, PAF is not typically associated with the characteristic ST-segment elevation seen in this ECG.

D. Ventricular tachycardia (VT) would present with a wide complex tachycardia, which is not seen in this ECG. The rhythm is regular, and the QRS complexes are narrow, making VT unlikely.

E. Sick sinus syndrome typically presents with sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses, or atrial fibrillation, none of which are seen in this ECG.

Brugada syndrome is a rare but important diagnosis to consider in patients presenting with syncope or palpitations, especially in young adults with a family history of sudden cardiac death. The diagnosis is often made based on the characteristic ECG pattern, and genetic testing may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.",Success
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea, and a weight loss of 4 kg (8.8 lb) over the last 4 months. She has recently avoided drinking alcohol and eating spicy food because it worsens her diarrhea and causes episodes of heart palpitations and reddening of the face and neck. She takes lisinopril for hypertension. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 149/90 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft, and there is mild tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. Laboratory studies show an increased urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration. Further evaluation of this patient will most likely show which of the following?",E,"The correct answer is B. Achlorhydria.

The patient's symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and flushing (reddening of the face and neck), are consistent with carcinoid syndrome. The increased urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentration supports this diagnosis, as 5-HIAA is a metabolite of serotonin, which is produced by carcinoid tumors.

Achlorhydria (the absence of hydrochloric acid in the stomach) is a common finding in patients with carcinoid syndrome, particularly those with gastric carcinoid tumors. This is because the tumor cells produce serotonin, which inhibits gastric acid secretion.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings:

A. Proximal muscle wasting is more commonly associated with neuromuscular disorders or endocrine disorders such as hyperthyroidism.

C. Adrenal medullary mass is related to pheochromocytoma, which can cause hypertension, palpitations, and flushing, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are more consistent with carcinoid syndrome.

D. Multiple peptic ulcers are not typically associated with carcinoid syndrome.

E. Pulmonic valve stenosis is a cardiac condition that is not related to the patient's symptoms or laboratory findings.

It's worth noting that further evaluation of this patient would likely involve imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, to localize the tumor and assess its extent, as well as somatostatin receptor scintigraphy to confirm the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome.",Success
"A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to a productive cough. His cough has been increasing in frequency and severity over the course of 3 days, and his sputum production has increased in volume. The color of his sputum is yellow-green. He denies any chest pain or palpitations but has experienced worsening shortness of breath with exertion and at rest, which is above his baseline. He has not noticed any changes in his weight or edema in his lower extremities. He denies any recent history of long travel. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been hospitalized four times for similar symptoms within the last year. He has smoked approximately 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 45 years. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 156/94 mmHg, pulse is 101/min, and respirations are 26/min with an oxygen saturation of 85% on room air. On physical exam, the patient has difficulty speaking, and there is asynchronous motion between the chest and abdomen with respiration. Wheezing is appreciated on pulmonary auscultation. An ECG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm. A chest radiograph is obtained, and he is administered supplemental oxygen. He is started on ipratropium, albuterol, and methylprednisolone. Which of the following should be added to this patient's treatment regimen?",D,"The correct answer is D. Levofloxacin.

This patient presents with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), characterized by increased cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath. The yellow-green color of his sputum suggests a bacterial infection, and his medical history of frequent hospitalizations for similar symptoms indicates a high risk of developing a severe infection.

The patient is already receiving bronchodilators (ipratropium and albuterol) and corticosteroids (methylprednisolone), which are appropriate for managing COPD exacerbations. However, antibiotics are also necessary to treat the underlying bacterial infection.

The choice of antibiotic depends on the severity of the infection and the patient's risk factors. In this case, the patient's temperature, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation indicate a moderate to severe infection. Additionally, his history of frequent hospitalizations and COPD exacerbations puts him at risk for developing a more severe infection, such as pneumonia.

Levofloxacin (Option D) is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is commonly used to treat COPD exacerbations, particularly those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common pathogen in patients with COPD. It has a broad spectrum of activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, making it a suitable choice for this patient.

Amoxicillin (Option A) is a penicillin antibiotic that is often used to treat community-acquired pneumonia, but it may not be effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Cefazolin (Option B) is a cephalosporin antibiotic that is typically used to treat skin and soft tissue infections, rather than respiratory infections.

Ceftriaxone (Option C) is a cephalosporin antibiotic that is often used to treat severe infections, such as pneumonia, but it may not be necessary in this case, given the patient's moderate severity of illness.

Penicillin (Option E) is a narrow-spectrum antibiotic that is not effective against many of the bacteria that cause COPD exacerbations.

In summary, adding levofloxacin to this patient's treatment regimen is the most appropriate choice, given the severity of his infection and his risk factors for developing a more severe infection.",Success
"A 55-year-old man presents with bloody nasal secretions and shortness of breath. He reports he has lost 4 kg (8.8 lb) in the last two months with no changes in his diet. He has also been suffering from mild to moderate joint pain in the left knee for the last year. His past medical history is unremarkable. His vitals include: blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg, temperature 37.0℃ (98.6℉), pulse 70/min, respiratory rate 14/min. Physical examination is significant for nasal ulcers. Diffuse crackles are present over all lobes of the lung bilaterally. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL
Hematocrit 37.7%
Leukocyte count 5500/mm3
Neutrophils 65%
Lymphocytes 30%
Monocytes 5%
Mean corpuscular volume 82.2 μm3
Platelet count 190,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 35 mm/h
C-reactive protein 14 mg/dL
Creatinine 3.09 mg/dL
The patient is prescribed a corticosteroid nasal spray and oral antibiotics but returns in 2 weeks without any clinical improvement. Which of the following would most likely confirm the diagnosis in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA).

The patient's symptoms, including bloody nasal secretions, shortness of breath, weight loss, and joint pain, are consistent with a diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), a type of vasculitis. The physical examination findings of nasal ulcers and diffuse crackles over all lobes of the lung bilaterally further support this diagnosis.

The laboratory findings, including an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), indicate inflammation, but are non-specific. The patient's lack of response to corticosteroid nasal spray and oral antibiotics suggests that the underlying condition is not simply a respiratory infection.

ANCA is a specific laboratory test that can help confirm the diagnosis of GPA. In GPA, ANCA is often positive, typically with a cytoplasmic staining pattern (c-ANCA) or perinuclear staining pattern (p-ANCA). The presence of ANCA in this patient would strongly support the diagnosis of GPA.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies are associated with rheumatoid arthritis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

B. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a non-specific marker of inflammation and does not confirm a specific diagnosis.

C. Anti-histone bodies are associated with drug-induced lupus, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

D. Anti-Ro is associated with Sjögren's syndrome, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Therefore, the correct answer is E. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA).",Success
"A 25-year-old Hispanic male presents with heat intolerance and recent weight loss. Serum analysis shows increased levels of T4 and T3, as well as the presence of thyroglobulin-stimulating immunoglobulins. The patient is found to be tachycardic and has marked edema and waxy discoloration in his legs. Which of the following would be consistent with this patient's disease?",C,"The correct answer is C. Exophthalmos.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as heat intolerance and weight loss, are consistent with hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland). The laboratory results showing increased levels of T4 and T3, as well as the presence of thyroglobulin-stimulating immunoglobulins, support this diagnosis. The presence of thyroglobulin-stimulating immunoglobulins suggests an autoimmune etiology, specifically Graves' disease.

Exophthalmos, or protruding eyes, is a common feature of Graves' disease, particularly in patients with hyperthyroidism. It is caused by inflammation and swelling of the tissues around the eyes, leading to bulging of the eyes.

Now, let's eliminate the other options:

A. Sympathetic underactivity is not consistent with hyperthyroidism, which is characterized by increased sympathetic activity, leading to symptoms such as tachycardia (rapid heart rate).

B. Anti-thyroglobin antibodies may be present in some autoimmune thyroid disorders, but they are not specific to Graves' disease or hyperthyroidism.

D. Increased TSH release is not consistent with hyperthyroidism, as TSH levels are typically suppressed in response to high levels of T4 and T3.

E. Multinucleate giant cells are not typically associated with Graves' disease or hyperthyroidism. They are more commonly seen in subacute thyroiditis, a different thyroid disorder.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Exophthalmos, which is a characteristic feature of Graves' disease and hyperthyroidism.",Success
"A 3-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for delayed passage of meconium. His mother is breastfeeding and has started to produce milk. The patient has been feeding well every two hours and is urinating over eight times per day. The patient was born at 35 weeks gestation to a 27-year-old gravida 4. The patient is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and the patient’s parents denied all prenatal genetic testing. The pregnancy was uncomplicated until the patient’s mother had spontaneous rupture of membranes at 35 weeks gestation. The patient’s three older siblings are all healthy. In the hospital nursery, the patient’s temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 48/32 mmHg, pulse is 164/min, and respirations are 48/min. On physical exam, he appears to be in moderate distress. He has no dysmorphic features, and his abdomen is distended and non-tender. Bowel sounds are absent.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is C. Contrast enema.

The patient's symptoms, particularly delayed passage of meconium, distended abdomen, and absent bowel sounds, are concerning for a potential bowel obstruction or intestinal atresia. Given the patient's age and presentation, the most likely diagnosis is Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, leading to a functional bowel obstruction.

A contrast enema is the best next step in management because it can help diagnose Hirschsprung's disease by showing a transition zone between the normal and aganglionic segments of the colon. Additionally, it can help rule out other potential causes of bowel obstruction, such as meconial ileus or small bowel atresia.

Here's why the other options are not the best choice:

A. Abdominal CT is not the best initial test for evaluating bowel obstruction in a neonate. While it may provide more detailed information about the bowel anatomy, it exposes the patient to radiation and may not provide the same level of diagnostic accuracy as a contrast enema.

B. Abdominal radiograph (KUB) may show signs of bowel obstruction, such as dilated loops of bowel or air-fluid levels, but it is not specific enough to diagnose Hirschsprung's disease.

D. Upper gastrointestinal series is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a lower GI obstruction.

E. Sweat testing is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, which is not a likely diagnosis based on the patient's presentation.

It's essential to note that after the contrast enema, the patient may require further evaluation, such as a rectal biopsy, to confirm the diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease.",Success
"A 78-year-old woman presents to the office for an annual health check-up with her family physician accompanied by her daughter. She has no complaints during this visit but her daughter states that she is having difficulty locating objects such as the television remote, car keys, and her purse. Her medical history is significant for Alzheimer’s dementia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis and centrilobular emphysema. The patient takes memantine, atorvastatin, metformin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, aspirin, albuterol, and ipratropium. The patient’s vitals are within normal limits today. Physical exam reveals an elderly female in no acute distress, oriented to person, place and year, but not to month or day of the week. She has a 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border along with an S3 gallop. There are mild crackles at the lung bases. The remainder of the exam is normal. A previous urine culture reports growth of > 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter. Urinalysis findings are offered below:
Leukocyte esterase  positive
WBCs 50-100 cell/HPF
Nitrites positive
RBCs 2 cell/HPF
Epithelial cells 2 cell/HPF
Urine pH 5.7
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",E,"The correct answer is B. Nitrofurantoin.

Here's why:

The patient's urinalysis results indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI), with positive leukocyte esterase, WBCs, and nitrites. The presence of nitrites in the urine is a strong indicator of a UTI, as certain bacteria, such as Enterobacter, can convert nitrates to nitrites.

Given the patient's medical history, particularly her age and comorbidities, it's essential to choose an antibiotic that is effective against UTIs and has a low risk of adverse interactions with her existing medications.

Nitrofurantoin (Option B) is a suitable choice for several reasons:

1. It is effective against Enterobacter, the bacteria isolated in the previous urine culture.
2. It has a low risk of interacting with the patient's medications, including memantine, atorvastatin, metformin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, aspirin, albuterol, and ipratropium.
3. Nitrofurantoin is generally well-tolerated and has a low risk of adverse effects, particularly in elderly patients.
4. It is a urinary tract-specific antibiotic, which reduces the risk of disrupting the patient's gut flora.

In contrast, the other options are not as suitable:

A. TMP-SMX may interact with the patient's medications, such as warfarin (not listed, but possible), and has a higher risk of adverse effects, including hyperkalemia.

C. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone, which may interact with the patient's medications, such as warfarin, and has a higher risk of adverse effects, including tendonitis and C. difficile infection.

D. Cephalexin may not be effective against Enterobacter, and its use may be associated with a higher risk of allergic reactions.

E. No treatment is necessary is not a suitable option, as the patient's urinalysis results indicate a UTI, which requires antibiotic treatment to prevent complications, such as pyelonephritis or sepsis.

In summary, nitrofurantoin is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's UTI, given its effectiveness, low risk of interactions, and favorable side effect profile.",Success
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of painful ulcers in her mouth. Over the past 2 months, she has had increasing fatigue and difficulties concentrating. She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and was started on a new medication 4 months ago. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes and three tender ulcerative lesions in her mouth. Her hemoglobin concentration is 8.7 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume is 109 μm3. A blood smear shows hypersegmented neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?",D,"The correct answer is D. Deficient nitrogenous base production.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results point towards a diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia, which is a type of anemia characterized by the production of abnormally large red blood cells. The key findings that support this diagnosis are:

1. Macrocytic anemia: The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is elevated at 109 μm3, indicating that the red blood cells are larger than normal.
2. Hypersegmented neutrophils: This is a characteristic feature of megaloblastic anemia, where the neutrophils have more than the usual number of lobes.
3. Fatigue and difficulties concentrating: These are common symptoms of anemia.
4. Mouth ulcers: This is a common finding in patients with megaloblastic anemia, particularly those with vitamin deficiencies.

The most likely cause of megaloblastic anemia in this patient is a deficiency of nitrogenous base production, specifically a deficiency of folate or vitamin B12. This is because the patient was started on a new medication 4 months ago, which may be interfering with the absorption or metabolism of these vitamins. The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and the use of certain medications, such as methotrexate, can increase the risk of folate deficiency.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Deficient heme synthesis would lead to microcytic anemia, not macrocytic anemia.

B. Deficient DNA crosslink repair is related to Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic disorder that is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

C. Deficient erythropoietin secretion would lead to anemia, but not specifically megaloblastic anemia.

E. Deficient β-globin chains would lead to thalassemia, a genetic disorder that is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's findings is a deficiency of nitrogenous base production, specifically a deficiency of folate or vitamin B12.",Success
"A 25-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider for evaluation of a ""painful mass in my left groin.""

Three weeks prior to her current symptoms she noted a small, painless ulcer on her labium majorum that resolved after a few days. She admits to having unprotected sex with a male partner a month ago while she was traveling in Southeast Asia. Temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 139/84 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination is significant for left-sided, tender, ulcerative lymph nodes with a dark discoloration. Which of the following is most likely to be seen in this patient's condition?",C,"The correct answer is A. Donovan bodies on Wright-Giemsa stain.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), a sexually transmitted infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L1, L2, and L3.

The patient's history of a painless ulcer on her labium majorum that resolved after a few days, followed by the development of a painful mass in her left groin that ruptured and ulcerated, is consistent with the typical presentation of LGV. The presence of tender, ulcerative lymph nodes with a dark discoloration on physical examination further supports this diagnosis.

Donovan bodies, which are intracellular inclusions of C. trachomatis, can be seen on Wright-Giemsa stain of a lymph node biopsy or aspirate. This is a diagnostic test for LGV.

Option B is incorrect because Gram-negative rods in school of fish formation on Gram stain are characteristic of Haemophilus ducreyi, which causes chancroid, a different sexually transmitted infection.

Option C is incorrect because while C. trachomatis is the causative agent of LGV, PCR is not a diagnostic test for this specific condition.

Option D is incorrect because a positive RPR, VDRL, and FTA-ABS would indicate syphilis, which is a different sexually transmitted infection.

Option E is incorrect because a Tzanck smear with multinucleated giant cells is diagnostic of herpes simplex virus infection, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination.

It's worth noting that LGV is a rare condition in the United States, but it's more common in certain parts of the world, such as Southeast Asia, which is where the patient traveled.",Success

She has a blood pressure of 136/94, heart rate of 84/min, and respiratory rate of 15/min. Initial examination shows global aphasia, right homonymous hemianopia, and hemisensory loss. An acute ischemic stroke caused by distal left internal carotid artery occlusion with salvageable penumbral tissue is diagnosed based on a non-contrast CT scan, brain MRI, and catheter cerebral angiogram. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is given as treatment within 3 hours of presentation. Which of the following cellular processes is typical of the section of reversible injury noted in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Decreased ATP.

The patient is experiencing an acute ischemic stroke, and the section of reversible injury noted in this patient refers to the ischemic penumbra. The ischemic penumbra is a region of brain tissue that is functionally impaired but not yet infarcted, and it is potentially salvageable with timely reperfusion.

In the ischemic penumbra, the cellular process that is typical is a decrease in ATP (adenosine triphosphate) production due to reduced blood flow and oxygen delivery. This leads to a state of energy crisis, where the cells are unable to maintain their normal functions. However, the cells in this region are not yet irreversibly damaged, and with timely reperfusion, ATP production can be restored, and cellular function can be recovered.

The other options are not directly related to the ischemic penumbra or the reversible injury noted in this patient:

A. Mitochondrial permeability is a process that occurs in the context of cell death, particularly apoptosis, and is not characteristic of the ischemic penumbra.

B. Caspase activation is a key step in the apoptotic pathway and is not directly related to the ischemic penumbra.

C. Lysosomal rupture is a process that occurs in the context of cell death, particularly necrosis, and is not characteristic of the ischemic penumbra.

D. Severe membrane damage is a feature of cell death, particularly necrosis, and is not characteristic of the ischemic penumbra.

It's worth noting that the administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within 3 hours of symptom onset is a standard treatment for acute ischemic stroke, and it aims to restore blood flow to the ischemic penumbra and salvage as much brain tissue as possible.",Success
"During the normal catabolism of protein, urea and ammonia are produced as waste products. If these waste products are not cleared by the liver and kidneys, hyperammonemia can occur, leading to confusion and delirium. Fortunately, a healthy liver can clear these waste products via the urea cycle. Which of the following reactions is the rate limiting step in this cycle?",A,"The correct answer is A. NH3 + HCO3- + 2 ATP --> carbamoyl phosphate + 2 ADP + Pi.

The urea cycle, also known as the ornithine cycle, is a series of biochemical reactions that occur in the liver and convert ammonia into urea, which is then excreted by the kidneys. The rate-limiting step of the urea cycle is the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthase I (CPS I), which converts ammonia, bicarbonate, and ATP into carbamoyl phosphate.

This reaction is the rate-limiting step because it is the first committed step of the urea cycle, and it is highly regulated to ensure that the cycle proceeds efficiently. The enzyme CPS I is activated by N-acetylglutamate, which is an allosteric activator that increases the enzyme's activity in response to high levels of ammonia.

The other options are not correct because:

B. The reaction catalyzed by ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) is the second step of the urea cycle, and while it is an important step, it is not the rate-limiting step.

C. The reaction catalyzed by argininosuccinate synthase (ASS) is the third step of the urea cycle, and it is not the rate-limiting step.

D. The reaction catalyzed by argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) is the fourth step of the urea cycle, and it is not the rate-limiting step.

E. The reaction catalyzed by arginase is the final step of the urea cycle, and it is not the rate-limiting step.

It's worth noting that the urea cycle is a critical process that helps to remove excess ammonia from the body, and defects in the cycle can lead to hyperammonemia and related disorders.",Success

He also complains of morning joint stiffness that improves with activity and reports feeling fatigued during the day. He started taking ibuprofen 2 months ago for the pain which initially subsided, but, over the last few weeks, it has worsened despite the medication. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 1 year ago and has had difficulty controlling his blood glucose levels. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol, or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a weight loss of 3.0 kg (6.6 lb) over the last 3 months despite no change in diet or activity level. Which of the following is the most likely 1st-line medication in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Methotrexate.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by symmetric polyarthritis, morning joint stiffness, and fatigue. The patient's joint involvement, including the proximal parts of his fingers and wrists, elbows, and knees, is also consistent with RA.

Given the patient's diagnosis, methotrexate is the most likely 1st-line medication. Methotrexate is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that is widely used as a first-line treatment for RA. It has been shown to be effective in reducing inflammation, slowing disease progression, and improving quality of life in patients with RA.

The other options are not correct for the following reasons:

A. Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive medication that is sometimes used to treat RA, but it is not typically used as a first-line medication.

B. Infliximab is a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitor that is used to treat RA, but it is typically reserved for patients who have failed to respond to DMARDs like methotrexate.

C. Anakinra is an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist that is used to treat RA, but it is not typically used as a first-line medication.

E. High-dose prednisone for 60 days is not a recommended treatment for RA. While corticosteroids like prednisone may be used to treat RA flares, they are typically used in short courses and at lower doses to minimize side effects.

It's worth noting that the patient's type 2 diabetes mellitus and difficulty controlling blood glucose levels may need to be taken into consideration when selecting a treatment, as some medications used to treat RA may affect glucose control.

"A previously healthy 29-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 35 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal visit. Current medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. A rectovaginal swab culture grows bacitracin-resistant colonies of gram-positive cocci with surrounding areas of clear hemolysis. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to decrease vertical transmission of this organism?",C,"The correct answer is C. Administer ampicillin intrapartum.

The description of the rectovaginal swab culture growing bacitracin-resistant colonies of gram-positive cocci with surrounding areas of clear hemolysis is consistent with Group B Streptococcus (GBS) colonization. GBS is a common cause of neonatal sepsis and pneumonia, and vertical transmission from mother to baby can occur during delivery.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend that women with GBS colonization receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to reduce the risk of vertical transmission. The recommended antibiotic regimen is penicillin or ampicillin, which is option C.

Option A, scheduling a cesarean delivery, is not necessary for GBS colonization alone. While C-section may be indicated in certain situations, such as multiple gestations or placenta previa, it is not a recommended intervention for GBS colonization.

Option B, abstaining from breastfeeding, is not a recommended intervention for GBS colonization. Breastfeeding is encouraged, and GBS colonization does not contraindicate breastfeeding.

Option D, performing amniocentesis at 37 weeks, is not related to GBS colonization or vertical transmission.

Option E, administering intravenous immune globulin postpartum, is not a recommended intervention for GBS colonization. While IVIG may be used in certain situations, such as neonatal sepsis, it is not a recommended prophylactic measure for GBS colonization.

In summary, administering ampicillin intrapartum (option C) is the most appropriate intervention to decrease vertical transmission of GBS in this patient.",Success
"A 2-year-old girl is brought in to the office by her parents. They state that their daughter has recently been more irritable than usual, and she occasionally becomes pale and blue. Her parents note that she was diagnosed with a heart murmur, but it was never treated. Physical examination reveals a small child in distress. She is laying on the examination table with her knees drawn to her chest. Cardiac auscultation reveals a harsh, systolic ejection murmur that is best heard at the upper left sternal border. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Tetralogy of Fallot.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as irritability, pallor, and cyanosis (blue discoloration), are consistent with a cardiac condition that causes right-to-left shunting of blood, which is a hallmark of Tetralogy of Fallot.
* The physical examination finding of a harsh, systolic ejection murmur best heard at the upper left sternal border is also consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot. This murmur is typically caused by the obstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract, which is a key component of this condition.
* Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect that includes four anatomical abnormalities: ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. The combination of these defects leads to right-to-left shunting of blood, which can cause cyanosis and other symptoms seen in this patient.
* The other options are not as likely based on the symptoms and physical examination findings:
	+ Transposition of great vessels (Option B) would typically present with more severe cyanosis and respiratory distress, and the murmur would be heard in a different location.
	+ Pulmonary hypoplasia (Option C) is a rare condition that would not typically cause a harsh, systolic ejection murmur.
	+ Atrial septal defect (Option D) would not typically cause cyanosis or a harsh, systolic ejection murmur.
	+ Patent ductus arteriosus (Option E) would typically cause a continuous murmur, not a harsh, systolic ejection murmur.

According to current medical guidelines, Tetralogy of Fallot is a common congenital heart defect that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent complications. (Source: American Heart Association, ""Tetralogy of Fallot"")",Success
"An 18-year-old male is brought in by fire rescue. The patient was an unrestrained passenger in a motor vehicle crash and was ejected from the vehicle after collision. Upon arrival to the trauma bay, the patient has a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 6. He is rapidly intubated, and vitals are a temperature of 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse of 130 bpm, and blood pressure of 83/64 mmHg. He is noted to have multiple ecchymoses over his body, as well as petechiae and purpura. He has a laceration over his clavicle that continues to bleed despite a pressure bandage. Radiographs of his lower extremity show multiple long bone fractures. Two large bore IV lines are placed, and the patient oozes from around the sites of venepuncture. Labs are notable for a WBC of 20,000/mm^3, Hb of 10.1g/dL, platelets of 48,000/mm^3, and prolongation of the PT and aPTT. This patient's presentation can best be explained by which of the following diagnoses?",D,"The correct answer is D. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Here's why:

The patient's presentation is consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a life-threatening condition characterized by the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body. This leads to the consumption of clotting factors and platelets, resulting in bleeding and organ dysfunction.

The patient's symptoms and lab results support this diagnosis:

* Multiple ecchymoses, petechiae, and purpura indicate bleeding and clotting abnormalities.
* The laceration over the clavicle that continues to bleed despite pressure bandage suggests impaired hemostasis.
* Oozing from IV sites and prolonged bleeding times (PT and aPTT) further support coagulopathy.
* Thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 48,000/mm^3) is a hallmark of DIC.
* The patient's low hemoglobin (10.1g/dL) and elevated white blood cell count (20,000/mm^3) may indicate ongoing bleeding and inflammation.

While the other options may be related to trauma, they do not fully explain the patient's presentation:

* A. Fat embolization is a possible complication of long bone fractures, but it typically presents with respiratory distress, neurologic symptoms, and petechiae, which are not the primary features in this case.
* B. Air embolization is unlikely given the patient's presentation, and it would typically cause more prominent respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms.
* C. Tension pneumothorax is not supported by the patient's vital signs or radiographic findings.
* E. Coagulopathy of trauma is a broader term that encompasses DIC, but it is not a specific diagnosis that fully explains the patient's presentation.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and lab results are most consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a life-threatening complication of trauma.",Success
"A 60-year-old man presents to his local walk-in clinic with 1 week of fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, malaise, progressive shortness of breath, and sharp chest pain. He is found with a blood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, a heart rate of 84/min, an elevated respiratory rate, and a holosystolic heart murmur III/VI. His palms and soles show non-tender erythematous lesions. His personal medical history is relevant for frequent visits to the ER for lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the last month with a recent colonoscopy that reported an ulcerative lesion suggestive of colorectal cancer. He has not been subjected to dental procedures recently, and he denies the use of psychoactive drugs. A chest plain film shows clear lungs and mild cardiomegaly, and echocardiography reports the presence of vegetations involving the mitral valve. Which of the following organisms is the most likely causative agent?",E,"The correct answer is E. Streptococcus bovis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, particularly the non-tender erythematous lesions on the palms and soles, and the presence of vegetations on the mitral valve, suggest endocarditis. The patient's recent history of colorectal cancer and lower gastrointestinal bleeding increases the likelihood of Streptococcus bovis as the causative agent.

Streptococcus bovis is a known cause of endocarditis, particularly in patients with underlying gastrointestinal malignancies, such as colorectal cancer. The bacterium is commonly found in the gut flora and can enter the bloodstream through mucosal lesions, leading to bacteremia and endocarditis.

The other options are less likely:

A. Kingella kingae is a rare cause of endocarditis, typically seen in children.

B. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of endocarditis, but the patient's lack of recent dental procedures and denial of psychoactive drug use makes this option less likely.

C. Escherichia coli is not typically associated with endocarditis.

D. Haemophilus aphrophilus is a rare cause of endocarditis, typically seen in patients with underlying valvular heart disease.

The patient's symptoms, medical history, and echocardiography findings support Streptococcus bovis as the most likely causative agent.",Success
"A 31-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia is brought to the emergency department by police after being found agitated and attempting to steal from a grocery store. His past medical history is only notable for a recent office note from his primary care doctor for treatment of seasonal allergies. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 173/97 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a man who is very irritable and restless. He is not cooperative with exam or history and becomes combative requiring intramuscular medications and security restraining him. After this event, the rest of his exam is notable for 7 mm pupils which are equal and reactive to light, spontaneous movement of all limbs, normal sensation, and warm and sweaty skin. The patient is answering questions and states he wants to kill himself. Which of the following substances was most likely used by this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Cocaine.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation is consistent with sympathomimetic toxicity, which is characterized by agitation, irritability, tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia. The physical exam findings of 7 mm pupils, spontaneous movement of all limbs, normal sensation, and warm and sweaty skin further support this diagnosis.

Cocaine is a sympathomimetic drug that can cause these symptoms, particularly the agitation, irritability, and suicidal ideation. The patient's history of schizophrenia and recent office note for seasonal allergies do not suggest an alternative explanation for these symptoms.

Alcohol (Option A) would more likely cause sedation and decreased agitation, rather than increased agitation and suicidal ideation.

Diphenhydramine (Option C) is an antihistamine that can cause anticholinergic symptoms, such as dry skin, dilated pupils, and decreased sweating, which are not consistent with the patient's presentation.

Haloperidol (Option D) is an antipsychotic medication that would not cause the patient's symptoms, and it is unlikely that the patient would be taking this medication given their recent office note for seasonal allergies.

Marijuana (Option E) can cause altered mental status and agitation, but it would not typically cause the sympathomimetic symptoms seen in this patient.

It's worth noting that the patient's suicidal ideation is a significant concern and should be addressed promptly.",Success
"A 40-year-old obese man presents to his primary care provider with a history of excessive daytime somnolence and easy fatigability. Upon further questioning, it is found that although his sleeping hours are adequate, he does not feel refreshed in the morning. His wife complains that he snores loudly all night. After ruling out common medical disorders and possible drug abuse, he is advised an overnight polysomnogram that records 12 episodes of apnea and 30 episodes of hypopnea during a 7-hour sleep. Which of the following statements best describes this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is D. The most common site of a collapse of pharyngeal airway during sleep apnea is at the level of the base of the tongue.

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms, including excessive daytime somnolence, easy fatigability, and loud snoring, are consistent with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The overnight polysomnogram results, which show 12 episodes of apnea and 30 episodes of hypopnea during a 7-hour sleep, confirm the diagnosis.

Option D is correct because the most common site of pharyngeal airway collapse during sleep apnea is indeed at the level of the base of the tongue. This is due to the relaxation of the genioglossus muscle, which allows the tongue to fall back and obstruct the airway.

Option A is incorrect because an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 5 or more is a diagnostic criterion for OSA, but the exact AHI is not provided in the question stem.

Option B is incorrect because episodes of apnea and hypopnea are more likely to occur during lighter stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep, not deeper stages.

Option C is incorrect because mouth opening during sleep does not relieve airway obstruction in OSA. In fact, mouth breathing can worsen OSA by allowing the tongue and soft palate to fall back and obstruct the airway.

Option E is incorrect because android obesity (central obesity) is more strongly associated with OSA than gynoid obesity (peripheral obesity). This is because central obesity is associated with a higher amount of fat in the neck and throat area, which can contribute to airway obstruction.",Success
"A 70-year-old man presents with cough and progressively worsening shortness of breath for the last 6 months. He feels short of breath even without exertion and states he ‘got winded’ while walking to his bedroom last night. He describes his cough as non-productive and says he can identify no recognizable triggers. No significant past medical history. The patient is a retired welder and has been living with his son since his wife passed away 5 years ago. He denies any smoking history or current alcohol or drug use. His vital signs include: pulse rate 72/min, respiratory rate 15/min, blood pressure 134/80 mm Hg, and temperature 36.8°C (98.0°F). On physical examination, digital clubbing is noted. Bilateral basilar fine crackles on noted on pulmonary auscultation. Expiratory flow rates are measured and found to be high when corrected for lung volume. A chest X-ray is performed and shown in the image below. Which of the following most likely accounts for the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Radial traction on airway wall.

The patient's symptoms, physical examination, and chest X-ray are consistent with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a type of interstitial lung disease. The presence of digital clubbing, bilateral basilar fine crackles, and the chest X-ray findings support this diagnosis.

The question asks about the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient. In IPF, the lung parenchyma is scarred, leading to increased lung stiffness and reduced lung volume. However, the airways are not directly affected, and the radial traction on the airway wall is preserved. Radial traction refers to the outward pull of the surrounding lung tissue on the airway wall, which helps to keep the airways open. This preserved radial traction allows for higher expiratory flow rates than expected, given the reduced lung volume.

The other options are not directly related to the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient:

A. Anatomical dead space refers to the volume of the conducting airways that does not participate in gas exchange. While it may affect airflow, it is not the primary explanation for the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient.

B. Lung compliance refers to the ability of the lungs to expand and fill with air. In IPF, lung compliance is decreased due to scarring, but this would not explain the increased expiratory flow rate.

C. Physiological dead space refers to the volume of the lungs that does not participate in gas exchange due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch. While it may be affected in IPF, it is not the primary explanation for the increased expiratory flow rate.

E. Small airway wall thickness is not directly related to the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient.

In summary, the preserved radial traction on the airway wall due to the surrounding lung tissue is the most likely explanation for the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.",Success
"Two hours following an elective cholecystectomy, a 43-year-old woman has fever and chills. The patient received cephalexin for antibiotic prophylaxis and one unit of packed red blood cells during the procedure. She underwent a hysterectomy 9 years ago for leiomyomata uteri. She has a 5-year history of hypertension treated with lisinopril. Her temperature is 39.5°C (102.3°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 125/90 mm Hg. Examination shows a mildly tender abdominal wound without erythema. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. She had a Foley catheter and peripheral line access placed at the time of the procedure. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is D. Urinary tract infection.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms of fever and chills within 2 hours of surgery are concerning for a postoperative infection. Given the presence of a Foley catheter, urinary tract infection (UTI) is a high possibility.
* The patient's vital signs, including a temperature of 39.5°C (102.3°F) and a pulse of 90/min, are consistent with an infectious process.
* The absence of erythema or tenderness at the surgical site makes surgical site infection (C) less likely.
* Malignant hyperthermia (B) is a rare but life-threatening condition that typically occurs during anesthesia, not 2 hours postoperatively. It is also often accompanied by muscle rigidity, tachycardia, and acidosis, which are not mentioned in this scenario.
* Adverse effect of medication (A) is unlikely, as the patient received cephalexin for antibiotic prophylaxis, which is not typically associated with fever and chills.
* Transfusion reaction (E) is also unlikely, as the patient received only one unit of packed red blood cells, and the symptoms do not match those typically seen in a transfusion reaction (e.g., hives, itching, flushing, and hypotension).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections recommend that Foley catheters be removed as soon as possible to reduce the risk of UTI. In this scenario, the patient's symptoms are consistent with a UTI, making it the most likely cause of her symptoms.",Success
"The first 24 hours after delivery, a 2888 g (6.37 lb) male newborn is not feeding well, has a high-pitched cry, and is diaphoretic. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation to a 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, after an uncomplicated labor and delivery. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother did not receive prenatal care. She takes codeine syrup frequently for dry cough. The infant's temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 165/min, and blood pressure is 83/50 mm Hg. Examination shows hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. The baby is swaddled to prevent excoriations, and fluid resuscitation is initiated. Complete blood count and serum levels of glucose, bilirubin, and calcium are within normal limits. What is the most appropriate next step in treatment of this newborn?",A,"The correct answer is B. Oral clonidine therapy.

The newborn's symptoms, such as a high-pitched cry, diaphoresis, hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response, are indicative of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS occurs when a newborn is exposed to opioids in utero and experiences withdrawal symptoms after birth. The mother's frequent use of codeine syrup during pregnancy suggests that the infant was exposed to opioids, leading to NAS.

Clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is often used to treat NAS. It helps to reduce the severity of withdrawal symptoms and can be administered orally. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends clonidine as a treatment option for NAS, especially in cases where the mother used opioids during pregnancy.

Option A, oral morphine therapy, is not the best choice because morphine is an opioid, and administering it to an infant with NAS could exacerbate the condition.

Option C, intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin combination therapy, is not relevant to the diagnosis of NAS and would be used to treat a suspected infection.

Option D, oral methimazole therapy, is used to treat hyperthyroidism, which is not related to the symptoms presented.

Option E, dextrose infusion, may be necessary to prevent hypoglycemia in a newborn, but it is not a specific treatment for NAS.

It is essential to note that the treatment of NAS often involves a multidisciplinary approach, including supportive care, pharmacological therapy, and close monitoring of the infant's symptoms.",Success
"A 38-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, obesity, and hyperlipidemia presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of new bilateral blisters on her hands.

The patient works in the adult entertainment industry. On examination, there are multiple flaccid blisters of the bilateral dorsal hands with hemorrhagic crusts, mild scarring, and hyperpigmentation. In addition, increased hair growth is noted on the bilateral malar cheeks. Her temperature is 99.1° F (37.3° C), pulse is 95/min, blood pressure is 130/87 mmHg, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Her laboratory results are:

Leukocyte count: 9,000/mm^3
Hemoglobin: 12.4 g/dL
Platelets: 400,000/mm^3

Anti-nuclear antibody titer 1:320

Which of the following would confirm the diagnosis in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Urine porphyrin levels.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as bilateral blisters on the hands, hemorrhagic crusts, mild scarring, and hyperpigmentation, are consistent with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). The increased hair growth on the bilateral malar cheeks also supports this diagnosis.

PCT is a type of porphyria that is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. It is characterized by skin blistering and fragility, particularly on sun-exposed areas, and is often associated with other conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, obesity, and hyperlipidemia.

The laboratory results provided are not specific to PCT, but they do suggest that the patient has an underlying inflammatory condition, as evidenced by the elevated anti-nuclear antibody titer.

To confirm the diagnosis of PCT, urine porphyrin levels would be the most appropriate test. Elevated levels of uroporphyrin and 7-carboxylate porphyrin in the urine are diagnostic of PCT.

The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis of PCT:

A. Anti-dsDNA titers are more commonly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.

B. C-reactive protein is a non-specific marker of inflammation.

C. Anti-hemidesmosome titers are associated with bullous pemphigoid, a different skin condition.

E. Tzanck smear is a diagnostic test for herpes simplex virus infection, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

"A 64-year-old man presents with severe respiratory distress. This has onset over the past 3 weeks, progressively worsening. Past history involves congestive heart failure (CHF). Due to concerns of concurrent pneumonia, sputum studies are ordered. Microscopic examination of his sputum demonstrates heart failure cells (hemosiderin-containing macrophages). Which of the following cellular organelles is significant in the formation of these cells?",C,"The correct answer is C. Lysosomes.

Heart failure cells, also known as hemosiderin-containing macrophages, are a characteristic finding in the sputum of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). These cells contain hemosiderin, a pigment derived from the breakdown of hemoglobin. The formation of hemosiderin-containing macrophages involves the engulfment of red blood cells by macrophages, followed by the breakdown of hemoglobin within lysosomes.

Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles responsible for cellular digestion and recycling of cellular waste and foreign substances. In the case of heart failure cells, lysosomes contain enzymes that break down hemoglobin, releasing iron, which then combines with apoferritin to form hemosiderin. The presence of hemosiderin within macrophages is a hallmark of heart failure cells.

The other options are not directly involved in the formation of heart failure cells:

A. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in protein synthesis and folding, but not in the breakdown of hemoglobin.

B. Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis, but not directly related to the formation of heart failure cells.

D. Golgi apparatus is involved in protein modification and secretion, but not in the breakdown of hemoglobin.

E. Mitochondria are the site of cellular respiration, but not directly involved in the formation of heart failure cells.

"A previously healthy 52-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after sustaining burns over 45% of her body in a house fire. On arrival, she is in acute distress but is fully oriented. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun and the patient is transferred to the intensive care unit of a burn center. 20 hours later, she has several large, tarry black stools and develops hypotension and tachycardia. Despite appropriate lifesaving measures, she dies. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools?",D,"The correct answer is D. Decreased gastric blood flow.

The patient's symptoms, including tarry black stools, hypotension, and tachycardia, are consistent with a diagnosis of stress ulceration, also known as Curling's ulcer. This is a common complication of severe burns, particularly those covering more than 30% of the body surface area.

The most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools is decreased gastric blood flow. Severe burns can lead to a systemic inflammatory response, which can cause vasopressors to be released, resulting in vasoconstriction and decreased blood flow to the stomach. This decreased blood flow can lead to mucosal ischemia, erosion, and bleeding, resulting in the characteristic tarry black stools.

The other options are not directly related to the development of stress ulceration in this patient:

A. Decreased prostaglandin synthesis: Prostaglandins have a protective effect on the gastric mucosa, but decreased synthesis would not directly cause stress ulceration.

B. Erosion of tortuous submucosal arteriole: This is a description of a possible complication of peptic ulcer disease, but it is not the primary cause of stress ulceration in this patient.

C. Bacterial colonization of the gastric antrum: While bacterial colonization can contribute to the development of gastritis, it is not the primary cause of stress ulceration in this patient.

E. Increased stomach acid production: While increased acid production can contribute to the development of peptic ulcers, it is not the primary cause of stress ulceration in this patient.

It's worth noting that stress ulceration is a common complication of severe burns, and prompt recognition and treatment are essential to prevent further complications.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care provider after feeling sad and depressed for the past several months.

He takes some comfort in food and has gained about 9.1 kg (20 lb). He eats out several times a week and sometimes consumes 2 whole meals in one sitting. Other than this new obsession with eating large quantities of food and excess sleeping he no longer enjoys doing things he liked doing in the past. Besides eating and sleeping he is always excited to see his children and looks forward to their visits. He says it's the one thing keeping him going. Additionally, he does not feel like he has the same drive or focuses at work. He reports that he has no interest in hurting himself or others. His blood pressure is 119/81 mm Hg, pulse rate is 85/min, respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). His physical exam is normal. What other symptom is most likely present in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is B. Depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning.

The patient's symptoms, such as feeling sad and depressed, difficulty waking up in the morning, and loss of interest in activities, are consistent with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD). One of the common characteristics of MDD is that symptoms are often worse in the morning, which is known as diurnal variation. This is because the levels of certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and cortisol, tend to be lower in the morning, which can exacerbate depressive symptoms.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms:

A. Leaden paralysis is a symptom of atypical depression, which is characterized by increased appetite and sleep, but it is not a common feature of MDD.

C. Psychotic features, such as hallucinations or delusions, are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.

D. Stereotypies are repetitive, purposeless movements, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms and are more commonly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism.

E. Mania is a symptom of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by periods of elevated or irritable mood, increased energy, and decreased need for sleep. The patient's symptoms do not suggest mania, and he does not report any periods of elevated mood or increased energy.

"A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with acute shortness of breath that developed after a 10-hour international flight. His pulse is 124/min and pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 90%. He weighs 50-kg (110-lb). A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is suspected and intravenous heparin is initiated. If the volume of distribution of heparin is equivalent to 60 mL/kg and the target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL, which of the following is the most appropriate loading dose for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is A. 3,000 units.

To calculate the loading dose of heparin, we need to use the following formula:

Loading dose = Target peak plasma concentration x Volume of distribution

Given values:

* Target peak plasma concentration = 0.5 units/mL
* Volume of distribution = 60 mL/kg
* Patient's weight = 50 kg (110 lb)

First, let's calculate the volume of distribution in milliliters:

Volume of distribution (mL) = 60 mL/kg x 50 kg = 3000 mL

Now, we can calculate the loading dose:

Loading dose = 0.5 units/mL x 3000 mL = 1500 units

However, since the units are in milliliters and we need to administer the dose in units, we need to multiply the result by 2 (since 1 mL of heparin contains 2 units):

Loading dose = 1500 units x 2 = 3000 units

Therefore, the most appropriate loading dose for this patient is 3000 units (Option A).

Note: Options B, C, and E are incorrect, and Option D is not applicable since we are given the necessary information to calculate the loading dose.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to a surgeon with painless swelling over his right leg. He noticed the swelling 6 months ago, but he ignored it because it was painless. However, he is now concerned as the swelling has been increasing in size over the last 6 months. He also mentions that his father and brother have lipomas over the extremities. On physical examination, the swelling is well-circumscribed and non-tender, measuring approximately 4 x 5 cm. After evaluation, the surgeon performs a surgical resection of the tumor and sends the tissue for histopathological examination. The pathologist reports the tumor to be a liposarcoma rather than a lipoma. Which of the following enzymes is most likely to show increased activity in the cells of this patient’s tumor?",E,"The correct answer is E. Telomerase.

Here's why:

Liposarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that arises from adipose tissue. It is a malignant tumor, unlike lipoma, which is a benign tumor. Telomerase is an enzyme that helps maintain the length of telomeres, which are repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes. Telomerase activity is typically low in normal cells, but it is often increased in cancer cells, including liposarcoma.

Increased telomerase activity allows cancer cells to maintain their telomeres and continue to divide indefinitely, contributing to their immortalization and malignant behavior. Studies have shown that telomerase activity is elevated in various types of sarcomas, including liposarcoma.

The other options are not directly related to liposarcoma or cancer biology:

A. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme involved in various cellular processes, including bone mineralization and liver function. While it may be elevated in certain cancers, it is not specifically associated with liposarcoma.

B. DNase (deoxyribonuclease) is an enzyme that breaks down DNA. It is not directly related to liposarcoma or cancer biology.

C. RNase (ribonuclease) is an enzyme that breaks down RNA. Like DNase, it is not specifically associated with liposarcoma or cancer biology.

D. Superoxide dismutase is an enzyme involved in antioxidant defenses, protecting cells from oxidative stress. While it may have a role in cancer prevention, it is not directly related to liposarcoma or telomerase activity.

In summary, the correct answer is E. Telomerase, as it is the enzyme most likely to show increased activity in the cells of this patient's liposarcoma.",Success

Which of the following will most likely be found in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Elevated TSH.

The patient's symptoms, including difficulty concentrating, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, joint pain, and slow speech and movement, are consistent with hypothyroidism. The patient's past symptoms of palpitations, increased stool frequency, and hand tremor, which occurred 6 months prior, suggest a possible hyperthyroid state. The patient's physical exam findings, including delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes, also support a diagnosis of hypothyroidism.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. The symptoms of hypothyroidism can be non-specific and may develop slowly over time, making it challenging to diagnose. However, the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with hypothyroidism, and an elevated TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level would support this diagnosis.

Option B, a high PHQ-9 score, is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a medical condition rather than depression. Option C, improved symptoms with carbidopa/levodopa administration, is not relevant to this patient's symptoms, as carbidopa/levodopa is a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease, which is not suspected in this patient. Option D, positive anti-CCP antibodies, is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with rheumatoid arthritis, and the presence of anti-CCP antibodies would suggest an autoimmune disorder. Option E, positive urine toxicology, is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with drug use, and she has a history of only experimenting with lysergic acid diethylamide 6 years ago.",Success
"A 3466-g (7-lb, 10-oz) female newborn is delivered at 38 weeks' gestation to a 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1. Apgar scores are 7 and 8, at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother has a history of schizophrenia and was treated with lithium until 5 weeks' gestation, when she found out that she was pregnant. The mother was treated for alcohol abuse disorder 2 years ago. She has been sober for 14 months now. Examination shows that the child has micrognathia, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, and small, low-set ears. Examination of the mouth shows a cleft palate. A grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur can be heard over the left sternal border. Echocardiography shows a single overriding great vessel arising from the heart. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?",A,"The correct answer is A. Low levels of parathyroid hormone in serum.

The newborn's physical examination findings, including micrognathia, broad nasal bridge, short philtrum, small and low-set ears, cleft palate, and a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur, are consistent with a diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome). This syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22.

One of the characteristic features of DiGeorge syndrome is hypoparathyroidism, which leads to low levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the serum. This can cause hypocalcemia, which may require treatment.

The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome:

B. Double bubble sign on abdominal x-ray is a finding consistent with duodenal atresia, which is not a typical feature of DiGeorge syndrome.

C. Chromosome 5p deletion on FISH studies is a finding consistent with Cri-du-chat syndrome, a different genetic disorder.

D. Elongated tricuspid valve leaflets on echocardiography are not a typical feature of DiGeorge syndrome. The echocardiography findings in this case are more consistent with a conotruncal heart defect, such as tetralogy of Fallot, which is a common cardiac anomaly associated with DiGeorge syndrome.

E. Bilateral cataracts on ocular examination are not a typical feature of DiGeorge syndrome. Cataracts are more commonly associated with other genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome.

It's worth noting that the mother's history of lithium use during pregnancy may have contributed to the development of Ebstein's anomaly, a heart defect that can occur in infants exposed to lithium in utero. However, the echocardiography findings in this case are more consistent with a conotruncal heart defect, such as tetralogy of Fallot, which is a common cardiac anomaly associated with DiGeorge syndrome.",Success
"A 10-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician after discovering a painless mass in the left testicle. Results from tumor markers and a biopsy are as follows:
AFP 350 ng/mL (normal value < 10 ng/mL)
hCG 0.4 IU/L (normal value < 0.5 IU/L)
Biopsy: Presence of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells.
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Yolk sac tumor.

Here's why:

* The elevated AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) level is a strong indicator of a yolk sac tumor. AFP is a tumor marker that is often elevated in yolk sac tumors, and a level of 350 ng/mL is significantly higher than the normal value of <10 ng/mL.
* The biopsy results are also consistent with a yolk sac tumor. The presence of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells, is a characteristic histological feature of yolk sac tumors. These structures are known as Schiller-Duval bodies.
* The other options can be ruled out based on the biopsy results and tumor marker levels:
	+ Classic seminoma (A) typically has a different histological appearance, with uniform cells and a lymphocytic infiltrate. AFP levels are usually normal in seminoma.
	+ Choriocarcinoma (B) is a type of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia that is typically associated with elevated hCG levels, which are not seen in this case.
	+ Teratoma (C) is a type of germ cell tumor that can have a variety of histological appearances, but it is not typically associated with elevated AFP levels or the specific histological features seen in this case.
	+ Embryonal carcinoma (D) is a type of germ cell tumor that can have a variety of histological appearances, but it is not typically associated with the specific histological features seen in this case, and AFP levels are usually normal or only mildly elevated.

Therefore, based on the tumor marker levels and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is a yolk sac tumor.",Success
"An 80-year-old man presents with severe pain of the right lower extremity. He says that symptoms had an acute onset while he was in the ICU for a COPD exacerbation due to a recent upper respiratory infection, which was treated with nebulized albuterol and ipratropium bromide, continuous oxygen, IV methylprednisolone, and levofloxacin. He says he has been hospitalized 3 other times this year for COPD exacerbations. The medical history is significant for a left main coronary artery myocardial infarction after a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 2 months ago, mild cognitive impairment, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications are metformin, aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, atorvastatin, galantamine, and enalapril. He reports a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. His temperature is 39.0°C (102.5°F); blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg; pulse is 122/min; respiratory rate is 20/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. The physical examination is significant for the cutaneous finding shown in the picture. The involved area is severely tender to palpation and there are warmth and crepitus. A foul-smelling discharge is also noted. Pain seems out of proportion to the exam findings. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Immediate debridement and empiric IV antibiotics.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including severe pain, warmth, crepitus, and foul-smelling discharge, are consistent with necrotizing fasciitis, a life-threatening soft tissue infection. The cutaneous finding shown in the picture, likely a necrotic lesion with a black eschar, further supports this diagnosis.

Immediate debridement is crucial in the management of necrotizing fasciitis to remove dead tissue, reduce bacterial load, and prevent further tissue damage. Empiric IV antibiotics should be administered to cover for common causative organisms, such as Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium species.

Option A, high-dose IV dexamethasone, is not indicated in this scenario, as corticosteroids may worsen the infection and delay healing.

Option B, immediate debridement alone, is not sufficient, as antibiotics are necessary to combat the underlying infection.

Option D, biopsy of the wound, may be useful for diagnostic purposes, but it is not the next best step in management, as it would delay treatment.

Option E, contrast CT of the chest and abdomen, may be useful in evaluating for potential complications, such as sepsis or organ dysfunction, but it is not the primary concern in this scenario.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend immediate surgical debridement and empiric antibiotic therapy as the cornerstone of management for necrotizing fasciitis.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after losing consciousness at work. On presentation, she is found to be somnolent though she is able to be woken by vocal stimuli. She says that over the last 12 hours, she has been experiencing muscle spasms, blurred vision, dry mouth, and hallucinations. She says that the symptoms started after she went on a hike in the woods and foraged from plants along the way. Physical exam reveals dry red skin and enlarged pupils. Her bladder is also found to be completely full though she says she is unable to urinate. Which of the following drugs would most likely be administered to this patient to treat her symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Physostigmine.

The patient's symptoms, including muscle spasms, blurred vision, dry mouth, hallucinations, dry red skin, enlarged pupils, and urinary retention, are consistent with anticholinergic toxicity. The fact that she foraged for plants along the way suggests that she may have ingested a plant containing anticholinergic compounds, such as jimsonweed (Datura stramonium) or deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna).

Physostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that can reverse the effects of anticholinergic toxicity by increasing the levels of acetylcholine in the nervous system. It is the most likely drug to be administered to this patient to treat her symptoms.

Atropine (A) is an anticholinergic medication that would exacerbate the patient's symptoms, not treat them. Pralidoxime (C) is an antidote for organophosphate poisoning, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Pyridostigmine (D) and neostigmine (E) are also cholinesterase inhibitors, but they are not typically used to treat anticholinergic toxicity.

It's worth noting that physostigmine should be used with caution and under close medical supervision, as it can also have adverse effects, such as seizures and bradycardia.",Success
"A 34-year-old woman presents to the plastic surgery office 3 months following a rhinoplasty procedure. The patient has been recovering well. However, she has noticed a small whistling noise when she respires through her nose, which you appreciate on physical exam. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this phenomenon?",B,"The correct answer is C. A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow.

Here's why:

A whistling noise when respiring through the nose, also known as nasal turbulence, can be caused by altered airflow patterns in the nasal cavity. In this patient, who has undergone a rhinoplasty procedure, the most likely cause of this phenomenon is a deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow.

During rhinoplasty, the septum is often corrected to improve nasal breathing. However, if the septum is now too straight or narrow, it can cause turbulent airflow, leading to the whistling noise. This is because the airflow is no longer directed through the normal nasal passages, but instead, it is forced through a narrower or more direct route, creating turbulence and noise.

The other options are less likely causes of the whistling noise:

A. Post-operative swelling: While swelling can cause nasal congestion and altered airflow, it would not typically cause a whistling noise.

B. A septal hematoma causing a perforation: A septal hematoma is a complication of rhinoplasty that can cause a perforation in the septum. However, this would more likely cause nasal congestion, bleeding, or crusting, rather than a whistling noise.

D. Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow: Columellar show refers to the amount of columella (the narrow strip of skin and cartilage between the nostrils) that is visible from the front. Excessive columellar show would not typically cause a whistling noise.

E. A fracture of the bony septum: A fracture of the bony septum could cause nasal congestion, pain, or bleeding, but it would not typically cause a whistling noise.

In summary, the most likely cause of the whistling noise in this patient is a deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow.",Success
"A 43-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-day history of rash on the trunk and lower extremities. Three days ago, she visited a spa resort with multiple swimming pools and whirlpools. A friend of hers who also visited the spa has developed a similar rash. She does not smoke or drink alcohol and takes no medications. She appears well. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows multiple erythematous, excoriated papules and pustules over the trunk and upper thighs. The inflammation seen in this patient's condition most likely originated in which of the following parts of the skin?",B,"The correct answer is B. Hair follicles.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with folliculitis, an inflammatory condition of the hair follicles. The presence of erythematous papules and pustules on the trunk and upper thighs, particularly after visiting a spa resort with multiple swimming pools and whirlpools, suggests that the patient may have developed folliculitis due to bacterial or fungal infection of the hair follicles.

Folliculitis is a common condition that occurs when the hair follicles become infected or inflamed, often due to bacterial or fungal colonization. The inflammation in folliculitis originates in the hair follicles, which are located in the dermis, the layer of skin beneath the epidermis.

Option A, superficial epidermis, is incorrect because the epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin, and inflammation in this layer would not typically cause the symptoms and physical examination findings seen in this patient.

Option C, sebaceous glands, is also incorrect because while sebaceous glands are located in the dermis and can become inflamed, the symptoms and physical examination findings in this patient are more consistent with folliculitis than sebaceous gland inflammation.

Option D, papillary dermis, is incorrect because while the papillary dermis is the layer of skin where the hair follicles are located, the inflammation in this patient's condition is specifically related to the hair follicles, not the papillary dermis itself.

Option E, eccrine sweat glands, is incorrect because eccrine sweat glands are located in the dermis and are responsible for producing sweat, but they are not typically involved in folliculitis.

In summary, the correct answer is B. Hair follicles, as the inflammation in this patient's condition most likely originated in the hair follicles.",Success
A 19-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of severe right shoulder pain and inability to move the shoulder after a fall while climbing outdoors. Examination shows the right upper extremity is externally rotated and slightly abducted. There is loss of the the normal rounded appearance of the shoulder. The right humeral head is palpated below the coracoid process. Sensation to pinprick over which of the following skin areas is most likely to be reduced?,B,"The correct answer is A. Medial aspect of the upper arm.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with an anterior shoulder dislocation, also known as a subcoracoid dislocation. In this type of dislocation, the humeral head is displaced anteriorly and downward, often palpable below the coracoid process.

The skin area most likely to be affected by sensory loss in this case is the medial aspect of the upper arm, which is supplied by the axillary nerve (C5-C6). The axillary nerve is commonly injured in anterior shoulder dislocations, leading to numbness or tingling in the regimental badge area (the lateral aspect of the upper arm) and the medial aspect of the upper arm.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

B. Lateral aspect of the shoulder: This area is supplied by the axillary nerve, but it's not the most likely area to be affected in an anterior shoulder dislocation.

C. Skin above the clavicle: This area is supplied by the supraclavicular nerve (C3-C4), which is not typically affected in anterior shoulder dislocations.

D. Lateral aspect of forearm: This area is supplied by the radial nerve (C5-T1), which is not typically affected in anterior shoulder dislocations.

E. Dorsal aspect of forearm and hand: This area is supplied by the radial nerve (C5-T1) and the posterior interosseous nerve (C7-C8), which are not typically affected in anterior shoulder dislocations.

It's essential to note that a thorough neurological examination should be performed to assess for any nerve injuries or deficits in patients with shoulder dislocations.",Success
"A 25-year-old girl is brought to the emergency room after a suicide attempt. Her mother states that she found a large empty pill bottle next to her. The patient is conscious and tearful. She is currently complaining of severe abdominal pain but refuses to give any other history. She has a blood pressure of 135/86, respiratory rate of 18/min, and heart rate of 86/min. On examination, her abdomen is exquisitely tender with evidence of crepitus in the epigastric region. Abdominal CT reveals a gastric perforation. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",A,"The correct answer is D. Direct irritation of the stomach lining causing inflammation.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings, including severe abdominal pain, exquisite tenderness, and crepitus in the epigastric region, suggest a gastric perforation. Given the history of a suicide attempt and an empty pill bottle, it is likely that the patient ingested a large quantity of pills.

The most likely cause of the gastric perforation in this scenario is direct irritation of the stomach lining causing inflammation. This is because many medications, especially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can cause direct mucosal damage and inflammation, leading to gastric perforation.

Option A, decreased production of PGE2, is not directly related to gastric perforation. PGE2 is a prostaglandin that helps protect the gastric mucosa, but decreased production would not typically cause perforation.

Option B, buildup of a toxic metabolite due to kidney disease, is also unlikely. While kidney disease can lead to the buildup of toxic metabolites, this would not typically cause gastric perforation.

Option C, increased stimulation of the vagus nerve, is not directly related to gastric perforation. The vagus nerve does play a role in regulating gastric motility and secretion, but increased stimulation would not typically cause perforation.

Option E, hypovolemia, is also unlikely. While hypovolemia can lead to decreased perfusion of the stomach and potentially cause gastric injury, it is not the most likely cause of gastric perforation in this scenario.

In summary, the most likely cause of the gastric perforation in this patient is direct irritation of the stomach lining causing inflammation, likely due to the ingestion of a large quantity of pills.",Success
"A 32-year-old male presents to the ED with acute-onset chest pain. His blood pressure is 157/90 mmHg and his his pulse is 116/min. He appears anxious and agitated and a careful exam reveals dilated pupils and a perforated nasal septum. An EKG reveals ST segment elevation so he is urgently taken for cardiac intervention. Upon review, this patient reveals that he has not had care from a physician since he graduated from college. In the interim he has been largely unemployed and admits that he has recently been homeless. When asked directly, the patient admits to alcohol and marijuana use but denies illicit drug use. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the agent most likely responsible for this patient's presentation?",A,"The correct answer is A. Blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.

Based on the patient's symptoms, including acute-onset chest pain, hypertension, tachycardia, dilated pupils, and perforated nasal septum, it is likely that the patient has ingested cocaine. The patient's social history, including unemployment and homelessness, also increases the likelihood of substance abuse.

Cocaine is a sympathomimetic drug that works by blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, leading to an increase in the levels of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft. This results in stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, causing vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and hypertension. The patient's symptoms, including chest pain and ST segment elevation on EKG, are consistent with acute coronary syndrome, which can be caused by cocaine use.

The other options are not directly related to the mechanism of action of cocaine:

B. Inhibiting breakdown of biogenic amines is the mechanism of action of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which are a class of antidepressants.

C. Antagonizing the NMDA receptor is the mechanism of action of drugs like phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine, which are dissociative anesthetics.

D. Activating the acetylcholine receptor is the mechanism of action of cholinergic agonists, such as nicotine.

E. Inhibiting the GABA receptor is the mechanism of action of drugs like flumazenil, which is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist.

"A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of difficulty falling asleep for the past 2 months. She wakes up frequently during the night and gets up earlier than desired. She experiences discomfort in her legs when lying down at night and feels the urge to move her legs. The discomfort resolves when she gets up and walks around or moves her legs. She has tried an over-the-counter sleep aid that contains diphenhydramine, which worsened her symptoms. She exercises regularly and eats a well-balanced diet. She admits that she has been under a lot of stress lately. Her brother has similar symptoms. The patient appears anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and iron studies are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Pramipexole.

The patient's symptoms, including difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and an urge to move her legs due to discomfort, are consistent with Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS). The fact that her symptoms worsened with diphenhydramine, an antihistamine, and that she has a family history of similar symptoms, further supports this diagnosis.

Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist that is FDA-approved for the treatment of RLS. It is considered a first-line therapy for RLS, as it has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms and improving sleep quality.

Amitryptiline (Option A) is a tricyclic antidepressant that may exacerbate RLS symptoms due to its anticholinergic properties.

Codeine (Option C) is an opioid that may be used to treat pain, but it is not indicated for RLS and may have addictive potential.

Propranolol (Option D) is a beta blocker that may be used to treat anxiety, but it is not effective in treating RLS.

Escitalopram (Option E) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that may be used to treat depression and anxiety, but it is not indicated for RLS.

It's worth noting that the patient's anxiety may also need to be addressed, but the primary focus should be on treating her RLS symptoms.

Platelet count 175,000/mm3
Serum  
Calcium 8.0 mg/dL
Urea nitrogen 32 mg/dL
Amylase 250 U/L
An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's vital sign abnormalities?",B,"The correct answer is B. Capillary leakage.

The patient's vital sign abnormalities, specifically the hypotension (blood pressure of 84/58 mmHg) and tachycardia (pulse of 115/min), are likely due to capillary leakage. This is supported by the physical examination findings of abdominal distention, epigastric tenderness, and guarding, which suggest peritonitis or inflammation of the peritoneum. The patient's warm extremities also suggest a distributive shock, which is consistent with capillary leakage.

Capillary leakage leads to a loss of intravascular volume, resulting in hypotension and tachycardia as the body attempts to compensate for the decreased blood volume. The patient's laboratory results, including an elevated white blood cell count and amylase level, support the diagnosis of pancreatitis, which can cause capillary leakage and subsequent hypotension.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's vital sign abnormalities:

A. Abnormal coagulation and fibrinolysis: While pancreatitis can cause coagulopathy, it is not the primary cause of the patient's hypotension and tachycardia.

C. Decreased cardiac output: There is no evidence of cardiac dysfunction or failure in this patient.

D. Increased excretion of water: This would not explain the patient's hypotension and tachycardia.

E. Pseudocyst formation: While pseudocysts can occur in pancreatitis, they are not typically associated with hypotension and tachycardia.

Therefore, capillary leakage due to pancreatitis is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's vital sign abnormalities.",Success
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician for evaluation because his parents have been concerned by a number of troubling signs. Specifically, they have noticed that he has been exhibiting aggressive behavior as well as hyperactivity. In addition, he has had intellectual disability and is slow to hit developmental milestones. Physical exam reveals coarse facies, short stature, and joint stiffness. Eye exam reveals no abnormalities of the cornea or lens. Based on these findings, the patient is referred to a geneticist for further evaluation. Which of the following substances would most likely accumulate in the cells of this patient?",D,"The correct answer is C. Glucocerebroside.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Gaucher disease, a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down glucocerebroside, a type of glycolipid, into glucose and ceramide.

As a result of the enzyme deficiency, glucocerebroside accumulates in cells, particularly in macrophages, leading to the characteristic symptoms and physical findings seen in this patient, including intellectual disability, hyperactivity, aggressive behavior, coarse facies, short stature, and joint stiffness.

Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, and the geneticist would likely perform genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Cerebroside sulfate is not directly related to Gaucher disease. While it is a type of glycolipid, it is not the specific substance that accumulates in Gaucher disease.

B. Galactocerebroside is a type of glycolipid that accumulates in Krabbe disease, a different lysosomal storage disorder.

D. Heparan sulfate is a type of glycosaminoglycan that accumulates in mucopolysaccharidoses, such as Hurler syndrome or Hunter syndrome, which have different clinical presentations and physical findings.

E. Sphingomyelin is a type of phospholipid that accumulates in Niemann-Pick disease, another lysosomal storage disorder with different clinical and physical findings.

Her vital signs are within normal limits. On physical exam of the thyroid gland, a solitary nodule is palpated. It is fixed to the surrounding tissues and nontender. TSH is normal, and antithyroid antibodies are negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is E. Papillary carcinoma.

Here's why:

* The patient presents with a painless, slowly growing thyroid nodule that is fixed to the surrounding tissues, which is a common characteristic of thyroid cancer.
* The TSH level is normal, which rules out hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism as the cause of the nodule.
* The absence of antithyroid antibodies makes autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's disease) less likely.
* Endemic goiter (A) is a type of goiter caused by iodine deficiency, which is unlikely in this patient given the normal TSH level and lack of other symptoms.
* Graves' disease (C) is an autoimmune disorder that typically presents with hyperthyroidism, exophthalmos, and a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland, which is not consistent with this patient's presentation.
* Follicular carcinoma (B) is a type of thyroid cancer, but it is less common than papillary carcinoma and typically presents with a more aggressive clinical course.

Papillary carcinoma (E) is the most common type of thyroid cancer, accounting for approximately 80% of all thyroid malignancies. It often presents as a solitary, painless nodule in the thyroid gland, which is fixed to the surrounding tissues.

"A 4-year-old boy presents to the pediatrician’s office. His mother complains that he has been sleeping poorly, and she has noticed that he often scratches his perianal area. A scotch tape test is found to be positive and mebendazole is prescribed. Into which of the following subsets have the naïve T cells (TH0) developed due to the infection in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. TH2 cells.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and the positive scotch tape test indicate an infection with Enterobius vermicularis, also known as pinworms. Pinworm infections are known to trigger a TH2-dominated immune response.

Naïve T cells (TH0) are immature T cells that have not yet encountered an antigen. When they encounter an antigen, they differentiate into various T helper cell subsets, including TH1, TH2, TH17, and Tregs.

In the case of pinworm infection, the immune response is characterized by the production of IgE antibodies and the activation of TH2 cells. TH2 cells produce cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which promote the production of IgE and the recruitment of eosinophils.

TH1 cells, on the other hand, are involved in cell-mediated immunity and are typically activated in response to intracellular pathogens. TH17 cells are involved in the response to extracellular pathogens and are associated with inflammation. Tregs (regulatory T cells) are involved in immune regulation and tolerance. There is no such thing as ""T0 cells.""

Mebendazole, the prescribed medication, is an anthelmintic that targets the pinworms and helps to eliminate the infection.

So, in this patient, the naïve T cells (TH0) have developed into TH2 cells in response to the pinworm infection.",Success

The patient's symptoms are consistent with conduction aphasia, a type of aphasia characterized by difficulty repeating words or phrases, often with frequent phonemic paraphasias (sound substitutions) and neologisms (made-up words). The patient's ability to speak fluently in full sentences and demonstrate normal comprehension suggests that the issue is not with language processing or understanding, but rather with the transmission of information between language centers in the brain.

The left middle cerebral artery supplies the language areas of the brain, including Broca's area (responsible for speech production) and Wernicke's area (responsible for speech comprehension). Occlusion of a branch of the left middle cerebral artery, particularly the inferior division, can result in conduction aphasia.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms:

B. Right vertebral artery: The vertebral arteries supply the posterior circulation of the brain, which is not primarily involved in language processing.

C. Left posterior inferior cerebellar artery: The posterior inferior cerebellar artery supplies the cerebellum, which is involved in motor coordination and learning, but not language processing.

D. Left posterior cerebral artery: The posterior cerebral artery supplies the occipital lobe, which is primarily involved in visual processing, not language processing.

E. Left penetrating artery: Penetrating arteries are small branches that supply deep structures of the brain, but they are not specifically related to language processing or the symptoms described.

It's essential to note that a thorough neurological examination and imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and identify the exact location and extent of the occlusion.",Success
"An investigator is studying the frequency of polycythemia in a population of a remote, mountainous region. A representative sample of 100 men shows a normal distribution of hemoglobin concentration with a mean concentration of 17 g/dL and a standard error of 0.1 g/dL. Which of the following best represents the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL?",B,"The correct answer is E. 5%.

To solve this problem, we can use the z-score formula and the standard normal distribution (also known as the z-distribution or bell curve). The z-score formula is:

z = (x - μ) / σ

where x is the value of interest (in this case, 18 g/dL), μ is the mean (17 g/dL), and σ is the standard deviation. Since we are given the standard error (SE) instead of the standard deviation, we need to convert the SE to the standard deviation. The standard error is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size (n). So, we can calculate the standard deviation as:

σ = SE × √n
= 0.1 × √100
= 1

Now, we can calculate the z-score:

z = (18 - 17) / 1
= 1

Using a z-score table or calculator, we find that the probability of a z-score greater than 1 is approximately 0.159 (or 15.9%). This means that about 15.9% of the population will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 1 standard deviation above the mean (i.e., greater than 18 g/dL).

However, since the question asks for the probability of a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL, which is exactly 1 standard deviation above the mean, we know that this corresponds to the tail area of the normal distribution, which is approximately 5%. Therefore, the correct answer is E. 5%.",Success

Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows mildly increased echogenicity of the liver. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be found in this patient?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Cutaneous xanthomas.

Justification:

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a chronic autoimmune liver disease characterized by the destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, itchiness, and jaundice, along with the laboratory findings of elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels, are consistent with PBC.

Cutaneous xanthomas are a common finding in patients with PBC, particularly in those with elevated cholesterol levels. Xanthomas are yellowish deposits of lipid that can occur on the skin, especially on the palms, soles, and eyelids. They are a result of the deposition of cholesterol and other lipids in the skin due to the impaired bile acid metabolism in PBC.

The other options are not directly related to PBC:

A. Inferior vena cava thrombosis is not typically associated with PBC.

C. Butterfly-shaped vertebrae are a radiographic finding seen in osteoporosis, which may be a complication of PBC, but it is not a direct consequence of the disease.

D. Increased CA 19-9 levels are more commonly associated with pancreatic cancer or cholangiocarcinoma, not PBC.

E. Kayser-Fleischer rings are a characteristic finding in Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder of copper metabolism, and are not typically seen in PBC.

Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient is cutaneous xanthomas.",Success
"A 32-year-old pregnant woman presents to her physician with flu-like symptoms for the past 3 days. She has a runny nose, mild headache, and feels achy. She has a mild fever and diffuse rash over her body. She is concerned about the health of her baby and wants to know if there are any medications that will make her feel better in a short time. Currently, she is at her 29th week of gestation and has received the tetanus vaccination as part of the antenatal care program she received since she immigrated at the end of her first trimester from Romania. She is otherwise healthy. Considering this patient, she is at a higher risk of giving birth to a newborn who will present with which of the following options?",B,"The correct answer is E. Tricuspid valve regurgitation.

The patient's symptoms, such as flu-like symptoms, mild fever, and diffuse rash, are consistent with a viral infection. However, considering her immigration from Romania and her gestational age, the key factor is her risk of giving birth to a newborn with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).

Rubella, also known as German measles, is a viral infection that can cause severe birth defects if contracted during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester. The patient's immigration from Romania and her receipt of the tetanus vaccination as part of her antenatal care program suggest that she may not have been vaccinated against rubella or may not have had immunity to rubella at the time of her immigration.

Congenital rubella syndrome can cause various cardiac defects, including tricuspid valve regurgitation, which is a common finding in CRS. The other options are not directly related to CRS or the patient's symptoms.

* Single S2 (Option A) is a normal heart sound and is not associated with CRS.
* Wide pulse pressure (Option B) is not a specific finding in CRS.
* Brachial-femoral delay (Option C) is a sign of coarctation of the aorta, which is not typically associated with CRS.
* Double split S2 (Option D) is a heart sound that can be found in various cardiac conditions, but it is not a specific finding in CRS.

It is essential to note that the patient should receive proper counseling and testing to determine her rubella immunity status and to assess the risk of CRS in her fetus.",Success
An investigator is studying bacterial adaptations to the environment in an infectious isolate and a noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B. Animals exposed to the noninfectious isolate do not develop symptoms of infection. The investigator cultivates the noninfectious isolate in a culture with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate. Some of the animals exposed to these bacteria develop symptoms of infection. Which of the following processes is most likely responsible for the described findings?,C,"The correct answer is C. Transformation.

Here's why:

The scenario describes a noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B that becomes infectious after being cultured with lysed bacteria from an infectious isolate. This suggests that some genetic material from the infectious isolate is being transferred to the noninfectious isolate, allowing it to become infectious.

Transformation is the process by which free DNA is taken up by a bacterial cell, resulting in a change in its genotype and phenotype. In this case, the lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate likely released DNA that was then taken up by the noninfectious isolate, allowing it to acquire the necessary genetic material to become infectious.

Conjugation (A) involves the direct transfer of DNA from one bacterial cell to another through a specialized structure called a pilus. While conjugation can also result in the transfer of genetic material, it is not the most likely explanation in this scenario, as it requires direct cell-to-cell contact.

Reassortment (B) is a process that occurs in viruses, not bacteria, and involves the shuffling of genetic material between different viral strains.

Generalized transduction (D) is a process by which a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria) accidentally packages bacterial DNA into its capsid, which is then transferred to another bacterial cell. While this process can also result in the transfer of genetic material, it is not the most likely explanation in this scenario, as it requires the presence of a bacteriophage.

Recombination (E) is a broader term that refers to the process of combining genetic material from different sources. While recombination is indeed occurring in this scenario, the specific mechanism by which it is occurring is transformation.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Transformation.",Success
"A 40-year-old female with a past medical history of high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, and asthma presents to the primary care clinic today. She has tried several different statins, all of which have resulted in bothersome side effects. Her current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, albuterol, oral contraceptives, and a multivitamin. Her physical examination is unremarkable. Her blood pressure is 116/82 mm Hg and her heart rate is 82/min. You decide to initiate colesevelam (Welchol). Of the following, which is a concern with the initiation of this medication?",D,"The correct answer is D. Timing of the dosing of colesevelam should be separated from this patient's other medications.

Colesevelam (Welchol) is a bile acid sequestrant used to treat high cholesterol. It works by binding to bile acids in the gut, which are then excreted, reducing the amount of cholesterol produced in the liver.

The concern with initiating colesevelam in this patient is that it can interact with other medications by reducing their absorption. Colesevelam can bind to other medications, including oral contraceptives, levothyroxine, and hydrochlorothiazide, reducing their efficacy. Therefore, it is recommended to separate the dosing of colesevelam from these medications by at least 4 hours to minimize this interaction.

The other options are not accurate concerns with the initiation of colesevelam:

A. Flushing and itching are not common side effects of colesevelam.

B. Cognitive impairment is not a known side effect of colesevelam.

C. Colesevelam is not associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis (gallstones).

E. Colesevelam can actually increase HDL (good) cholesterol, not decrease it.

"A 62-year-old patient with a history of deep venous thrombosis is enrolled in a clinical trial for a new oral anticoagulant. This novel drug has the property where its clearance is relatively predictable based on patient demographics and can easily be extrapolated from other data. Its metabolism and volume of distribution also do not change dramatically from patient to patient. The investigator wants to make sure that the plasma concentration of the drug in this patient is 15 mg/L and he knows the following drug characteristics.

Bioavailability: 50%
Drug half-life: 2 hours
Volume of distribution: 14.3 liters

Which of the following represents the maintenance dose that should be given to this patient every 8 hours?",D,"To determine the maintenance dose, we need to calculate the dose required to achieve a steady-state plasma concentration of 15 mg/L.

First, let's calculate the clearance (CL) of the drug using the formula:

CL = (Dose / AUC) × Bioavailability

where AUC is the area under the curve.

Since the volume of distribution (Vd) is given, we can use the formula:

CL = (0.693 × Vd) / Half-life

CL = (0.693 × 14.3 L) / 2 h = 4.97 L/h

Now, we can calculate the dose required to achieve a steady-state plasma concentration of 15 mg/L using the formula:

Dose = (CL × Css) / Bioavailability

where Css is the desired steady-state plasma concentration.

Dose = (4.97 L/h × 15 mg/L) / 0.5 = 149.1 mg/h

Since the patient needs to be dosed every 8 hours, we need to calculate the total dose required for 8 hours:

Total dose = 149.1 mg/h × 8 h = 1192.8 mg

However, this is not an option. The closest option is:

D. 1200 milligrams

"A 7-day-old infant boy presents to an emergency department due to poor feeding. His parents are recent immigrants to the United States. He was born in a traditional home birth and has never seen a medical provider. Mom had no prenatal care, has no medical issues, and is unvaccinated. The baby had been breastfeeding well until 24 hours ago when mom noticed he started having trouble latching. In the last 12 hours, he has completely refused to feed. He has had a decreased number of wet diapers and has stooled twice in the last 24 hours. His temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 52/min, and blood pressure is 70/50 mmHg. On exam, the infant has increased tone, a clenched jaw, no head lag, and clenched hands. Initial screening bloodwork is normal. What is the most likely organism causing this infant's presentation?",B,"The correct answer is B. Clostridium tetani.

The infant's presentation is consistent with neonatal tetanus, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. The symptoms include:

* Difficulty feeding (trouble latching)
* Increased tone (stiffness)
* Clenched jaw (trismus)
* No head lag (increased tone in the neck muscles)
* Clenched hands (increased tone in the extremities)

Neonatal tetanus typically occurs in infants born to mothers who are not immunized against tetanus and is acquired through contamination of the umbilical cord stump, often during delivery or post-delivery care. The lack of prenatal care and vaccination in the mother increases the risk of tetanus transmission to the infant.

Clostridium tetani is the causative organism of tetanus, producing a potent neurotoxin that causes muscle stiffness and spasms.

The other options are not as likely:

A. Clostridium botulinum is a possibility, but the symptoms are more consistent with tetanus. Botulism typically presents with a flaccid paralysis, not increased tone.

C. Escherichia coli is a common cause of neonatal sepsis, but the symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.

D. Group B streptococcus is also a common cause of neonatal sepsis, but the symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.

E. Listeria monocytogenes is a possible cause of neonatal sepsis, but the symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.

It's essential to note that the diagnosis of neonatal tetanus should be made clinically, and treatment should be initiated promptly, as it is a medical emergency.",Success
"A 28-year-old woman presents with facial flushing, weakness, and chronic diarrhea for the past month. She denies any history of smoking, alcohol use, or recreational drug use.

Her blood pressure is 120/88 mm Hg, pulse is 78/min, temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), and respiratory rate is 16/min. Laboratory findings are unremarkable, except for a potassium level of 3.3 mmol/L and serum calcium of 11 mg/dL. The attending physician suspects that this might be a case of a genetic mutation in the menin 1 gene on chromosome 11 and orders a genetic analysis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. VIPoma.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as facial flushing, weakness, and chronic diarrhea, are consistent with a VIPoma (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide-oma). VIPomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors that produce excessive amounts of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), leading to a characteristic clinical syndrome.

The laboratory findings, including hypokalemia (low potassium level) and hypercalcemia (high calcium level), are also consistent with a VIPoma. VIP can cause potassium wasting and increased calcium levels.

The attending physician's suspicion of a genetic mutation in the menin 1 gene on chromosome 11 further supports the diagnosis of a VIPoma. MEN1 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1) syndrome is a genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing VIPomas, among other endocrine tumors.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings:

A. Vibrio cholera infection would typically present with acute, profuse watery diarrhea, not chronic diarrhea, and would not explain the facial flushing or electrolyte abnormalities.

C. Rotavirus is a common cause of acute gastroenteritis in children, but it would not cause chronic diarrhea or electrolyte abnormalities in an adult.

D. Campylobacter jejuni is a bacterial infection that can cause acute gastroenteritis, but it would not explain the patient's chronic symptoms or electrolyte abnormalities.

E. Somatostatinoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that produces excessive amounts of somatostatin, leading to a different clinical syndrome characterized by diabetes, gallstones, and steatorrhea. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings do not support this diagnosis.

The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, obesity, and asthma. His current medications include albuterol, lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide. On physical exam you note an obese gentleman who seems to be in pain. You note prominent weakness of external rotation of his right upper extremity. When you ask the patient to slowly lower his right arm to his side when he holds it overhead, you note that he suddenly drops his arm and appears to be in pain. The patient's strength is 1/5 for abduction of the right arm. Which of the following is most likely injured in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Supraspinatus.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with a supraspinatus injury. The supraspinatus muscle is responsible for abduction of the arm, and the patient has significant weakness (1/5 strength) in this movement. The sudden drop of the arm when lowering it from an overhead position, known as a ""drop arm sign,"" is also a classic finding in supraspinatus injuries.

The patient's history of lifting weights and moving furniture over the weekend suggests a possible acute injury to the supraspinatus tendon, which is a common cause of shoulder pain and weakness.

The other options are less likely:

* Infraspinatus (B) is responsible for external rotation, but the patient's weakness is primarily in abduction.
* Teres minor (C) is also involved in external rotation, but it's not typically associated with the drop arm sign or significant weakness in abduction.
* Subscapularis (D) is responsible for internal rotation, which is not mentioned as a weakness in the patient's exam.
* Deltoid (E) is responsible for shoulder abduction, but it's not typically associated with the drop arm sign or weakness in the early stages of abduction.

Which of the following symptoms is most likely to also be present in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Chorea.

The patient's symptoms, including painless subcutaneous nodules on the back of the wrist, outside elbow, and front of the knees, as well as inflammation in the joints of the lower extremities, are consistent with a diagnosis of post-streptococcal reactive arthritis (PSRA). PSRA is a complication of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection, which is commonly seen in children.

Chorea, also known as Sydenham's chorea, is a neurological manifestation of rheumatic fever, which can occur after a GABHS infection. It is characterized by involuntary, rapid, and purposeless movements of the face, arms, and legs. Chorea is a common symptom of rheumatic fever and is often seen in conjunction with other symptoms such as arthritis, carditis, and subcutaneous nodules.

If this patient’s current medication is to be continued, which of the following laboratory tests should be ordered at this time?
 ",D,"The correct answer is D. Complete blood count.

Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic medication that is known to cause agranulocytosis, a potentially life-threatening side effect characterized by a severe decrease in white blood cell count. The risk of agranulocytosis is highest during the first 6 months of treatment, but it can occur at any time.

According to the FDA and the American Psychiatric Association, patients taking clozapine should have regular complete blood counts (CBCs) to monitor for agranulocytosis. The recommended frequency of CBC monitoring varies, but it is typically done weekly for the first 6 months, then biweekly for the next 6 months, and monthly thereafter.

The other options are not directly related to the monitoring of clozapine therapy:

A. Slit-lamp examination is used to evaluate the eye and is not related to clozapine therapy.

A small amount of tuberculin fluid is injected into the subcutaneous tissue on the left forearm. Examination of the injected area 48 hours later shows no induration or erythema. Impairment of which of the following processes is the most likely cause of the negative tuberculin skin test seen in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and test results suggest active tuberculosis (TB) infection. The tuberculin skin test, also known as the Mantoux test, is used to diagnose latent TB infection or to monitor individuals at risk of developing TB. A positive reaction indicates that the individual has been infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

In this case, the patient has a negative tuberculin skin test, which is unexpected given the presence of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum and radiographic evidence of TB. A negative reaction can occur in individuals with impaired cell-mediated immunity, such as those with HIV/AIDS.

The interaction between B7 and CD28 ligands is crucial for T-cell activation and differentiation. CD28 is a co-stimulatory receptor on T-cells that interacts with B7 molecules on antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages. This interaction is necessary for the activation of T-cells, which play a central role in cell-mediated immunity.

In HIV-infected individuals, the depletion of CD4+ T-cells and the dysfunction of antigen-presenting cells can impair the interaction between B7 and CD28 ligands, leading to a negative tuberculin skin test.

The other options are not directly related to the immune response involved in the tuberculin skin test:

A. Interferon-α is involved in the innate immune response and is not directly related to the tuberculin skin test.

C. Opsonization by complement proteins is involved in the humoral immune response and is not directly related to the tuberculin skin test.

D. Interleukin-4 is a cytokine involved in the differentiation of T-cells, but it is not directly related to the interaction between B7 and CD28 ligands.

E. Generation of reactive oxygen species is involved in the antimicrobial activity of phagocytic cells, but it is not directly related to the tuberculin skin test.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s low blood pressure?",D,"The correct answer is D. Adrenocortical insufficiency.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation is consistent with meningitis, likely caused by Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus). The petechial rash, neck rigidity, and rapid deterioration in condition are all characteristic features of meningococcal meningitis.

The patient's low blood pressure (90/50 mm Hg) is likely due to adrenal insufficiency, which is a common complication of meningococcal sepsis. Meningococcal infection can cause adrenal hemorrhage, leading to adrenal insufficiency and subsequent hypotension.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's presentation and low blood pressure:

A. Miliary tuberculosis is a disseminated form of tuberculosis, which is not consistent with the patient's acute presentation and symptoms.

B. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is not typically associated with acute meningitis or adrenal insufficiency.

"A chronic opioid abuser undergoes emergency surgery. Following the operation, the man is started on a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) thought to be dosed adequately to control his pain in the face of his opioid tolerance. He reports intense pain 6 hours after the conclusion of the surgery. Which agent could have been given intraoperatively to reduce this patient's risk of developing postoperative hyperalgesia?",A,"The correct answer is A. Ketamine.

Postoperative hyperalgesia is a phenomenon where patients experience increased sensitivity to pain after surgery, often due to the use of opioids during the procedure. This can be particularly problematic in patients with opioid tolerance, like the one described in the scenario.

Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been shown to reduce the risk of postoperative hyperalgesia when administered intraoperatively. This is because NMDA receptors play a role in central sensitization, which contributes to the development of hyperalgesia. By blocking these receptors, ketamine can help mitigate this effect.

Studies have demonstrated that intraoperative ketamine administration can reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption, particularly in patients with opioid tolerance. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) also recommends considering the use of ketamine as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen in patients at risk of developing postoperative hyperalgesia.

The other options are not supported by evidence for reducing postoperative hyperalgesia:

* Thiopental (B) is a barbiturate that can induce anesthesia but has no specific effect on postoperative hyperalgesia.
* Midazolam (C) is a benzodiazepine used for sedation and anxiolysis, but it does not have a role in reducing postoperative hyperalgesia.
* Propofol (D) is an anesthetic agent that can be used for maintenance of anesthesia, but it does not have a specific effect on postoperative hyperalgesia.
* Etomidate (E) is an anesthetic agent that can be used for induction of anesthesia, but it does not have a role in reducing postoperative hyperalgesia.

In summary, ketamine is the most appropriate choice for reducing the risk of postoperative hyperalgesia in this patient.",Success

Laboratory studies show decreased haptoglobin levels and increased LDH levels. A photomicrograph of a peripheral blood smear is shown. Which of the following is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?",D,"The correct answer is E. Osmotically fragile erythrocytes.

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, jaundice, and cyanosis, along with the laboratory findings of decreased haptoglobin levels and increased LDH levels, suggest hemolysis. The photomicrograph of the peripheral blood smear likely shows red blood cells with characteristic abnormalities, such as spherocytes, which are indicative of hereditary spherocytosis.

Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in genes that code for proteins involved in the red blood cell membrane, leading to osmotically fragile erythrocytes. These abnormal red blood cells are prone to hemolysis, resulting in anemia, jaundice, and other symptoms.

She is accompanied by her sister who says that her symptoms developed acutely and is unsure about what caused it. She is currently on methimazole, which she last took approximately 1 week ago. Approximately 5 days ago she developed an upper respiratory infection managed with bed rest and ibuprofen. Her temperature is 105°F (40.6°C), blood pressure is 95/68 mmHg, pulse is 145/min, and respirations are 23/min. On physical examination, the patient has altered mentation and is agitated and diaphoretic. The patient also has a goiter, exophthalmos, warm skin, and a hand tremor. She is started on intravenous fluids. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Propranolol.

The patient's symptoms, such as confusion, anxiety, sweating, vomiting, and altered mentation, along with the physical examination findings of exophthalmos, goiter, warm skin, and hand tremor, are consistent with thyroid storm. Thyroid storm is a life-threatening condition that occurs in patients with untreated or undertreated hyperthyroidism, often triggered by an underlying infection or other stressors.

Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is the best treatment option for this patient. It is effective in reducing the symptoms of thyroid storm by blocking the effects of excessive thyroid hormone on the heart and peripheral tissues. Propranolol can help to decrease the patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and symptoms of anxiety and agitation.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Antibiotics may be necessary to treat the underlying upper respiratory infection, but they will not address the patient's thyroid storm.

B. Carotid massage is not a treatment for thyroid storm and may even exacerbate the condition.

C. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that may be used to treat anxiety or seizures, but it is not a specific treatment for thyroid storm.

D. Epinephrine is a sympathomimetic medication that may worsen the patient's symptoms and is not a treatment for thyroid storm.

It's worth noting that, in addition to propranolol, the patient will likely require other treatments, such as antithyroid medications, corticosteroids, and supportive care, to manage the thyroid storm.",Success
"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because he was vomiting and seemed abnormally sleepy at home. On presentation, he is found to be confused and very lethargic. His parents said that he has had a fever and cough for several days prior to presentation and was given an over the counter medication. Physical exam of this patient reveals mild hepatomegaly and dry mucous membranes. Which of the following effects would the drug most likely also have on the nephron?",B,"The correct answer is B. Constriction of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, it is likely that the over-the-counter medication given to the patient is acetaminophen (Tylenol). The patient's presentation is consistent with acetaminophen overdose, which can cause hepatic toxicity, leading to confusion, lethargy, and hepatomegaly.

Acetaminophen can also affect the nephron, and in this case, it would likely cause constriction of the afferent arteriole and no effect on the efferent arteriole. This is because acetaminophen can cause vasoconstriction, which would decrease blood flow to the glomerulus, leading to a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The afferent arteriole is responsible for delivering blood to the glomerulus, so constriction of this arteriole would reduce blood flow and GFR. The efferent arteriole, on the other hand, is responsible for draining blood from the glomerulus, and acetaminophen would not have a direct effect on it.

The other options are not correct:

A. Constriction of both afferent and efferent arterioles would not be expected with acetaminophen overdose.

C. Dilation of the afferent arteriole would increase blood flow to the glomerulus and GFR, which is not consistent with acetaminophen's effects.

D. Constriction of the efferent arteriole would increase blood pressure in the glomerulus and GFR, which is not consistent with acetaminophen's effects.

E. Dilation of the efferent arteriole would decrease blood pressure in the glomerulus and GFR, which is not consistent with acetaminophen's effects.

It's important to note that acetaminophen overdose can cause nephrotoxicity, especially in combination with other factors such as dehydration or pre-existing kidney disease. However, in this scenario, the primary effect on the nephron would be constriction of the afferent arteriole.",Success
"A 54-year-old woman presents with sudden onset, mild vaginal bleeding for the past day. She says she is postmenopausal, and her last menstrual period was 5 years ago. A detailed workup is performed, and several premalignant lesions are found in her uterus. The patient agrees to a hysterectomy. The surgical team decides to use an anesthesia protocol consisting of nitrous oxide, desflurane, and atracurium. Which of the following best describes the role of atracurium in this patient’s anesthesia?",D,"The correct answer is D. It competes with acetylcholine for binding sites in the neuromuscular junction.

Atracurium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) used in anesthesia to facilitate muscle relaxation and intubation. Its mechanism of action involves competing with acetylcholine for binding sites at the neuromuscular junction, thereby reducing the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles and resulting in muscle relaxation.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Reducing neuron and muscle tissue excitability is a characteristic of anesthetics, not atracurium specifically.

B. Increasing GABA-linked chloride channel opening is a mechanism of action for benzodiazepines, not atracurium.

C. Acting on pain centers in the spinal cord and brain is a characteristic of analgesics, not atracurium.

E. Persistently depolarizing cholinergic receptors on the motor end plate is a mechanism of action for depolarizing NMBAs like succinylcholine, not atracurium.

In this scenario, the anesthesia team is using atracurium to provide muscle relaxation during the hysterectomy procedure, allowing for easier intubation and surgical access.",Success
"A 22-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of swelling in her face, hands, and neck with occasional abdominal pain. The symptoms usually resolve in 2 to 3 days. She has had these swelling events her whole life; however, they have become more debilitating recently. Last week she had an event that restricted her ability to eat and swallow.  Past medical history is noncontributory. Her father is alive and well with no significant medical history. Her mother and her maternal aunt have a similar condition. Today, her physical exam is within normal limits. She brought a picture of her swollen hand as seen in the picture. The treating physician has a strong suspicion of an inherited disorder. C1-inhibitor levels are ordered and found to be extremely low. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Hereditary angioedema.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as recurrent episodes of swelling in the face, hands, and neck, along with abdominal pain, are consistent with hereditary angioedema (HAE). The fact that the symptoms resolve on their own in 2-3 days and have been present since childhood also supports this diagnosis.

The family history is also significant, as the patient's mother and maternal aunt have a similar condition. This suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which is characteristic of HAE.

The physical exam being within normal limits is also consistent with HAE, as the swelling episodes can be intermittent and may not be present at the time of examination.

The low C1-inhibitor levels further support the diagnosis of HAE. C1-inhibitor is a protein that regulates the complement system, and deficiencies in this protein can lead to increased bradykinin production, which causes blood vessel dilation and increased permeability, resulting in angioedema.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

A. DiGeorge syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by thymic hypoplasia, immunodeficiency, and cardiac defects, which do not match the patient's symptoms.

B. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired phagocytosis, recurrent infections, and oculocutaneous albinism, which do not match the patient's symptoms.

C. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a rare X-linked recessive disorder characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections, which do not match the patient's symptoms.

D. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a rare acquired disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of hemolysis, which do not match the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, family history, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is hereditary angioedema (HAE).",Success
"A 24-year-old woman gravida 2, para 1 at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. She feels well. Her earlier pregnancy was uncomplicated. This is her 4th prenatal visit. She had an ultrasound scan 2 weeks ago that showed a live intrauterine pregnancy consistent with a 22-week gestation with no anomalies. She had a normal Pap smear 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 24-week gestation. Her blood group and type is B positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is C. Rh antibody testing.

Here's why:

At 24 weeks' gestation, the patient is in her second trimester. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), Rh antibody testing is recommended between 24 and 28 weeks' gestation to identify Rh-negative women who may require Rh immune globulin administration to prevent alloimmunization.

The patient's blood type is B positive, which means she is Rh positive. However, it's still necessary to perform Rh antibody testing to ensure she doesn't have any antibodies that could affect the pregnancy.

The other options are not the most appropriate next step in management at this stage:

A. Oral glucose challenge test: This is typically performed between 24 and 28 weeks' gestation to screen for gestational diabetes, but it's not the most pressing concern at this visit.

B. Cardiotocography (CTG): Also known as non-stress testing, CTG is used to monitor fetal heart rate and is typically performed later in pregnancy (around 32 weeks) or in high-risk pregnancies.

D. Swab for GBS culture: Group B streptococcus (GBS) screening is recommended between 35 and 37 weeks' gestation, not at 24 weeks.

E. Tdap vaccination: While Tdap vaccination is recommended during pregnancy, the optimal time for vaccination is between 27 and 36 weeks' gestation to maximize maternal antibody response and transfer of antibodies to the fetus.

Therefore, Rh antibody testing is the most appropriate next step in management at this prenatal visit.",Success
"A 42-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of dyspnea, chest pain, and hemoptysis that were preceded by 4 days of myalgia and a low-grade fever. He is currently visiting the United States as a tourist from Turkey, where he works at a factory that processes sheep wool and hide. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. A sputum culture grows gram-positive rods in gray colonies that have irregular margins with wavy projections on microscopy. Which of the following virulence factors of the causal organism increased its survival in host tissue?",A,"The correct answer is A. Glutamate capsule.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with anthrax infection, which is caused by Bacillus anthracis. The gram-positive rods with gray colonies and irregular margins with wavy projections on microscopy are characteristic of B. anthracis.

The glutamate capsule is a virulence factor of B. anthracis that plays a crucial role in its survival in host tissue. The capsule is composed of poly-D-glutamic acid and helps the bacterium to evade the host's immune system by inhibiting phagocytosis and complement activation. The capsule also protects the bacterium from antimicrobial peptides and other host defense mechanisms.

The other options are not correct because:

* Toxin B is not a virulence factor of B. anthracis. Anthrax toxin is composed of three components: protective antigen, edema factor, and lethal factor. While these toxins are important for the pathogenesis of anthrax, they are not involved in the bacterium's survival in host tissue.
* Protein A is a virulence factor of Staphylococcus aureus, not B. anthracis.
* IgA protease is a virulence factor of certain bacteria, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae, but not B. anthracis.
* Sulfatides are not a virulence factor of B. anthracis.

It's worth noting that the patient's occupation in a factory that processes sheep wool and hide is a risk factor for anthrax infection, as B. anthracis can be found in animal products.",Success
"A 27-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 38 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital for active labor. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes and fetal weight is estimated to be at the 90th percentile for gestational age. During delivery, there is an arrest in the second stage of labor, and a vacuum-assisted delivery is performed. Postpartum examination shows a third-degree laceration in the vagina extending into the perineum at the 6 o'clock position. This patient is most likely to experience which of the following complications?",C,"The correct answer is C. Fecal incontinence.

A third-degree laceration extending into the perineum at the 6 o'clock position indicates a significant injury to the anal sphincter, which is responsible for controlling bowel movements. This type of injury can lead to fecal incontinence, as the damaged anal sphincter may not be able to properly regulate bowel movements.

Urge incontinence (Option A) is more commonly associated with urinary incontinence, not fecal incontinence. Vesicovaginal fistula (Option B) is a rare complication that occurs when there is an abnormal connection between the bladder and vagina, leading to urinary incontinence. Small bowel obstruction (Option D) is not directly related to the vaginal laceration or perineal injury. Stress incontinence (Option E) is a type of urinary incontinence that occurs when there is increased pressure on the bladder, such as during coughing or sneezing, but it is not directly related to the perineal injury in this scenario.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), third-degree lacerations are associated with a higher risk of fecal incontinence, and women with these injuries should be counseled about the potential for long-term bowel dysfunction.",Success

His physician is concerned about an abnormal fasting blood glucose and dyslipidemia. On further work-up with oral glucose tolerance test, the patient is diagnosed with diabetes. Which of the following associations is consistent with this patient’s most likely form of diabetes?",B,"The correct answer is B. Pancreatic islet cell amyloid deposition.

The patient's presentation, including his age, obesity, and gradual weight gain, suggests that he likely has type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). T2DM is characterized by insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, and pancreatic islet cell dysfunction.

Option B, pancreatic islet cell amyloid deposition, is a hallmark feature of T2DM. Amyloid deposits, composed of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), are commonly found in the pancreatic islets of individuals with T2DM. These deposits can contribute to beta-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance.

In contrast, options A, C, and D are more characteristic of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). T1DM is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks and destroys the pancreatic islet cells, leading to insulin deficiency. The presence of HLA class II genes (option A), pancreatic islet cell leukocyte infiltration (option C), and autoantibodies against pancreatic islet cell antigens (option D) are all associated with T1DM.

Option E, unrelated to his abdominal obesity, is incorrect because the patient's abdominal obesity is a key risk factor for developing T2DM. Insulin resistance, which is often associated with obesity, particularly central obesity, is a major contributor to the development of T2DM.

Therefore, based on the patient's presentation and the characteristics of T2DM, option B, pancreatic islet cell amyloid deposition, is the most likely association.",Success
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a right breast mass that she noticed 3 weeks ago. It has rapidly increased in size during this period. She does not have pain. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows large dense breasts; a 5-cm, nontender, multinodular mass is palpated in the right outer quadrant of the right breast. There are no changes in the skin or nipple. There is no palpable cervical or axillary adenopathy. Mammography shows a smooth polylobulated mass. Biopsy of the mass shows papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Phyllodes tumor.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation with a rapidly growing, non-tender, multinodular mass in the right breast, along with the mammography finding of a smooth polylobulated mass, suggests a benign or borderline breast tumor. The biopsy result showing papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia further supports this diagnosis.

Phyllodes tumors are rare breast tumors that account for less than 1% of all breast neoplasms. They are typically characterized by a mixture of epithelial and stromal components, with papillary projections and hyperplasia. While they can be benign, some phyllodes tumors can be borderline or malignant, which is why atypia is often seen on biopsy.

Intraductal papilloma (Option A) is a benign breast tumor that typically presents as a small, solitary lesion within a duct. It is not typically multinodular or rapidly growing.

Fibroadenoma (Option C) is a common benign breast tumor, but it is usually smaller and more rounded than the mass described in this patient. Additionally, fibroadenomas do not typically exhibit papillary projections or atypia on biopsy.

Fibrocystic disease of the breast (Option D) is a benign breast condition characterized by cysts and fibrosis, but it does not typically present as a discrete mass.

Invasive lobular carcinoma (Option E) is a type of breast cancer, but it is not consistent with the patient's presentation or biopsy findings. Invasive lobular carcinoma often presents as a subtle, infiltrative mass, and the biopsy would show invasive cancer cells, not papillary projections and hyperplasia.

Therefore, based on the patient's presentation and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is a phyllodes tumor.",Success
"A 72-year-old Caucasian male presents to your office with dysphagia and halitosis. If this patient is also found to have cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction, which of the following is the most likely cause of his presenting symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is E. Zenker's diverticulum.

Here's why:

Zenker's diverticulum is a pouch-like herniation of the mucosa through the wall of the pharynx, typically in the cricopharyngeal region. It is a common cause of dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and halitosis (bad breath) in older adults. The cricopharyngeal muscle is a key muscle involved in swallowing, and dysfunction of this muscle can contribute to the development of Zenker's diverticulum.

The other options are not directly related to cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction:

A. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which stomach acid flows back up into the esophagus, causing symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation. While GERD can cause dysphagia, it is not typically associated with cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction.

B. Esophageal candidiasis is a fungal infection of the esophagus, which can cause dysphagia and odynophagia (painful swallowing). However, it is not directly related to cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction.

C. Glossopharyngeal nerve damage can cause dysphagia, but it is not typically associated with cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction or Zenker's diverticulum.

D. Meckel's diverticulum is a congenital pouch-like herniation of the small intestine, which can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. It is not related to cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction or Zenker's diverticulum.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the presence of cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction, Zenker's diverticulum is the most likely cause of his presenting symptoms.",Success

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in treatment?""",A,"The correct answer is A. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

This patient's symptoms, including acute onset of weakness in the lower extremities, sensory loss in the hands and feet, and absent reflexes, are consistent with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The history of a preceding respiratory illness and the laboratory results, including a normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count and elevated protein concentration, further support this diagnosis.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is the recommended treatment for GBS, as it has been shown to reduce the severity and duration of the illness. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines recommend IVIG as a first-line treatment for GBS, particularly within two weeks of symptom onset.

Prednisone (option B) is not recommended for the treatment of GBS, as it has not been shown to be effective in this condition.

Botulism antitoxin (option C) is not indicated, as there is no suggestion of botulism in this patient's presentation.

Intravenous acyclovir (option D) is not indicated, as there is no evidence of a viral infection such as herpes simplex or varicella-zoster.

He states that he must check everything 7 times in a specific order and if he goes out of order he must start from the beginning and perform it all over. He has recently been fired from his job because he is always late and lost his fiancee as she could not deal with his habits anymore. The physician explained that cognitive-behavioral therapy may be of assistance and also prescribed clomipramine. Which of the following is the mechanism of reaction of clomipramine?",D,"The correct answer is D. Blocks reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.

Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that is commonly used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which is the condition described in the patient's symptoms. The mechanism of action of clomipramine is that it blocks the reuptake of both norepinephrine and serotonin in the synaptic cleft, increasing their availability for neurotransmission. This leads to an increase in the activity of these neurotransmitters, which is thought to contribute to its therapeutic effects in OCD.

Option A is incorrect because clomipramine does not decrease the degradation of norepinephrine and serotonin. Option B is also incorrect because clomipramine does not work by alpha 2 receptor antagonism. Option C is incorrect because clomipramine blocks the reuptake of both norepinephrine and serotonin, not just norepinephrine. Option E is incorrect because clomipramine does not increase the presynaptic release of norepinephrine and dopamine from vesicles.

It's worth noting that clomipramine is not a first-line treatment for OCD, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often preferred due to their more favorable side effect profile. However, clomipramine can be effective in some cases, especially when other treatments have failed.",Success
"A 35-year-old Caucasian female presents to the hospital alarmed by her recent truncal weight gain, facial hair growth, and thinning skin. During the physical exam, the physician finds that the patient is hypertensive. Serum analysis reveals hyperglycemia. The physician suspects a pituitary adenoma. Which dexamethasone test result would help confirm the physician's suspicions?",E,"The correct answer is B. Low-dose, increased ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH.

The patient's symptoms, such as truncal weight gain, facial hair growth, and thinning skin, are consistent with Cushing's syndrome, which is a hormonal disorder caused by excessive levels of cortisol in the body. The physician's suspicion of a pituitary adenoma, specifically a corticotroph adenoma, is a common cause of Cushing's syndrome.

The dexamethasone suppression test is used to diagnose Cushing's syndrome and differentiate between various causes. The test involves administering a low dose of dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, and measuring the response of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels.

In a normal individual, the low dose of dexamethasone would suppress ACTH production. However, in a patient with a pituitary adenoma, the low dose of dexamethasone would not suppress ACTH production, and ACTH levels would remain elevated (Option B).

The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test is used to differentiate between pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome (Cushing's disease) and ectopic ACTH production. In Cushing's disease, the high dose of dexamethasone would suppress ACTH production, whereas in ectopic ACTH production, the high dose would not suppress ACTH production.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option B, which indicates that the patient has a pituitary adenoma (Cushing's disease).",Success
"A 24-year-old man with chronic back pain comes to the physician to establish care after moving to Florida. He complains of anxiety, nausea, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and diarrhea for three days.

Physical examination shows dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and piloerection. His abdominal exam shows diffuse mild tenderness. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding. His hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 8,000/mm, and platelet count is 250,000/mm3; serum studies and urinalysis show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",C,"The correct answer is E. Naloxone.

The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results are consistent with opioid withdrawal. The patient's history of chronic back pain and recent move to a new location suggest that he may have been taking opioids for pain management and is now experiencing withdrawal symptoms.

The physical examination findings of dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and piloerection are characteristic of opioid withdrawal. The patient's vital signs, including tachycardia and hypertension, also support this diagnosis.

Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can be used to treat opioid withdrawal. It works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, reversing the effects of opioids and precipitating withdrawal. In this case, naloxone is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to treat the patient's opioid withdrawal symptoms.

Lorazepam (A) is a benzodiazepine that may be used to treat anxiety, but it is not the best choice for opioid withdrawal. Naltrexone (B) is an opioid antagonist that can be used to treat opioid dependence, but it is not typically used to treat acute opioid withdrawal. Methadone (C) is an opioid agonist that can be used to treat opioid dependence, but it is not appropriate for treating opioid withdrawal. Morphine (D) is an opioid agonist that can worsen opioid withdrawal symptoms.

He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The pupils are equal and react sluggishly to light. Muscle strength in the proximal lower extremity is initially 3/5 but increases to 5/5 after repeated muscle tapping. His achilles reflex is 1+. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,E,"The correct answer is E. Lambert-Eaton syndrome.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, particularly the improvement in muscle strength after exercise (known as ""warm-up phenomenon""), are characteristic of Lambert-Eaton syndrome. This is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the nerve-muscle connection, causing muscle weakness, especially in the proximal muscles (such as those in the legs).

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

A. Polymyalgia rheumatica: This condition typically presents with muscle pain and stiffness, especially in the shoulders and hips, which is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.

B. Myasthenia gravis: While this condition also causes muscle weakness, it typically affects the ocular muscles first, causing drooping eyelids or double vision, which is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms. Additionally, myasthenia gravis does not typically exhibit the ""warm-up phenomenon"" seen in Lambert-Eaton syndrome.

C. Dermatomyositis: This condition is characterized by muscle weakness and skin rash, which is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.

D. Hypothyroidism: While hypothyroidism can cause muscle weakness, it is not typically associated with the ""warm-up phenomenon"" or the specific muscle strength pattern seen in this patient (initially 3/5, increasing to 5/5 after repeated muscle tapping).

The patient's smoking history and dry mucous membranes may be contributing factors to his symptoms, but they are not diagnostic of Lambert-Eaton syndrome. The sluggish pupillary response to light may be related to the patient's smoking history or other factors, but it is not a key diagnostic feature of Lambert-Eaton syndrome.

In summary, the combination of the patient's symptoms, particularly the ""warm-up phenomenon"" and the specific muscle strength pattern, point to Lambert-Eaton syndrome as the most likely diagnosis.",Success

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy the next morning confirms the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Which of the following is the best response to the patient's daughter's request?",B,"The correct answer is E. Tell the patient's daughter that the patient must be informed of the diagnosis.

The American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics states that patients have the right to be informed about their diagnosis, treatment options, and prognosis. The patient's autonomy and right to make informed decisions about their care should be respected.

In this scenario, the patient's daughter and brother, as the healthcare proxy, may have good intentions, but they do not have the authority to withhold the diagnosis from the patient. The patient has the right to know their diagnosis and make decisions about their care, including whether or not to pursue treatment.

Option A is incorrect because the healthcare proxy's role is to make decisions on behalf of the patient if they are unable to do so, not to withhold information from the patient.

Option B is incorrect because while it's important to understand the daughter's concerns, it's not relevant to the decision to disclose the diagnosis to the patient.

Option C is incorrect because it's still withholding information from the patient, and using euphemisms may not fully inform the patient about their condition.

Option D is incorrect because while an ethics consult may be helpful in complex situations, it's not necessary in this case, as the ethical principle of patient autonomy is clear.

His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 16/min. He is in no acute distress. A positive fluid wave is noted. The dorsal surface of the tongue is depapillated, and there are erythematous swollen patches at the oral commissures. A complete blood count and iron studies are reported below:

Hemoglobin: 12.1 g/dL
Hematocrit: 36%
Leukocyte count: 6,000/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 170,000/mm^3

Mean corpuscular volume: 70 um^3
Iron: 250 ug/dL
Ferritin: 300 ng/mL
Total iron binding capacity: 200 mcg/dL^3

Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is C. Erythrocytes with a ring of relative pallor.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of sideroblastic anemia, which is a type of anemia characterized by the presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow. Ring sideroblasts are abnormal erythroblasts that have a ring of iron-laden mitochondria around the nucleus.

The patient's history of chronic alcoholism and the presence of a positive fluid wave on physical examination suggest that he may have liver disease, which can lead to sideroblastic anemia. The laboratory results support this diagnosis, with an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and a low transferrin saturation, indicating iron overload.

The correct answer, C. Erythrocytes with a ring of relative pallor, is consistent with the presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow. This finding is characteristic of sideroblastic anemia.

Option A, Erythroblasts with mitochondrial iron deposits, is incorrect because while sideroblastic anemia is characterized by the presence of iron-laden mitochondria, this is not a characteristic of the erythrocytes themselves.

Option B, Erythrocytes lacking central pallor, is incorrect because it is not a characteristic of sideroblastic anemia.

Option D, Hypochromatic erythrocytes, is incorrect because sideroblastic anemia is not typically associated with hypochromia (pale color) of the erythrocytes.

Option E, Inclusions of denatured hemoglobin, is incorrect because it is not a characteristic of sideroblastic anemia.

It's worth noting that the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are also consistent with other conditions, such as vitamin deficiency or chronic disease, but the presence of a positive fluid wave and the elevated iron levels suggest that sideroblastic anemia is a likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 75-year-old man becomes pulseless in the cardiac intensive care unit 48 hours after admission for ST-elevation myocardial infarction. His blood pressure is 50/20 mm Hg. The ECG monitor shows a tachycardic irregular rhythm with erratic undulations, but no discernible P waves or QRS complexes. During immediate advanced cardiac life support, two attempts at defibrillation are made, after which the patient is given 1 mg of IV epinephrine. After another attempt at defibrillation, the patient remains pulseless and his blood pressure is 60/35 mm Hg. The ECG monitor shows no changes. Administration of which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is C. Epinephrine.

The patient is in cardiac arrest, specifically ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT), as evidenced by the tachycardic irregular rhythm with erratic undulations on the ECG monitor. The American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) recommend the following sequence of interventions for VF/VT:

1. Defibrillation (already attempted twice)
2. Epinephrine 1 mg IV (already administered)
3. Defibrillation (already attempted again)
4. Epinephrine 1 mg IV (next step)

The AHA guidelines recommend repeating the dose of epinephrine every 3-5 minutes during cardiac arrest. Since the patient remains pulseless and the ECG monitor shows no changes, the next step is to administer another dose of epinephrine.

The other options are not appropriate at this stage:

A. Sotalol is an antiarrhythmic medication that may be used to treat ventricular arrhythmias, but it is not indicated in cardiac arrest.

B. Amiodarone may be used to treat refractory VF/VT, but it is not the next step in this scenario, and epinephrine should be repeated first.

D. Dopamine is not recommended in cardiac arrest, as it may worsen outcomes.

E. Atropine is not indicated in VF/VT or cardiac arrest.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Epinephrine.",Success
"A 65-year-old man presents with left-sided numbness, diplopia, and blurring of vision. The diplopia is more prominent on his left-side lateral gaze. He denies having fever, headache, ocular pain, lacrimation, changes in color vision, or limb weakness. He has a past medical history of type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease. In addition, he had an ischemic stroke 9 years ago, from which he recovered completely with physiotherapy and rehabilitation. He has a history of a 56-pack-year cigarette smoking habit. His medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, glimepiride, metformin, metoprolol, and ramipril. The mental status examination is unremarkable. His muscle strength is normal in all 4 limbs. His sensations are decreased on his left side, including his face. The examination of extraocular movements is shown in the image. A lesion in which of the following locations explains the findings during eye examination?",E,"The correct answer is A. Cavernous sinus.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a lesion affecting the left cranial nerve III (oculomotor nerve), cranial nerve IV (trochlear nerve), and cranial nerve VI (abducens nerve). The diplopia (double vision) on left lateral gaze indicates weakness of the left lateral rectus muscle, which is innervated by cranial nerve VI. The decreased sensation on the left side of the face suggests involvement of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V).

The cavernous sinus is a venous sinus located near the pituitary gland and contains the internal carotid artery, as well as the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves. A lesion in the cavernous sinus, such as a thrombosis or tumor, can compress these nerves and cause the observed symptoms.

Option B, corticospinal tract before pyramidal decussation, is not related to the patient's eye movement symptoms. Option C, dorsal column-medial lemniscus, is related to sensation in the limbs, not the face or eye movements. Option D, frontal eye field, is involved in voluntary eye movements, but the patient's symptoms suggest a lesion affecting the cranial nerves, not the cerebral cortex. Option E, medial longitudinal fasciculus, is involved in conjugate gaze and would not cause the specific pattern of weakness seen in this patient.

The patient's history of smoking, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia increases his risk for atherosclerosis and thrombosis, which could contribute to a cavernous sinus thrombosis or other vascular lesions in this region.",Success
"A 5-day-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of poor feeding, irritability, and noisy breathing. The mother did not receive any prenatal care. His respirations are 26/min. Physical examination shows sunken fontanelles, tightly clenched fists, and erythema around the umbilical cord stump. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of the disease process in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Decreased release of glycine.

Based on the symptoms presented, such as poor feeding, irritability, and noisy breathing, along with physical examination findings like sunken fontanelles, tightly clenched fists, and erythema around the umbilical cord stump, the patient is likely suffering from neonatal tetanus.

Neonatal tetanus is caused by Clostridium tetani, which produces a toxin that blocks the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters, including glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), in the spinal cord and brainstem. This leads to an overactive nervous system, resulting in muscle stiffness, rigidity, and spasms.

The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of neonatal tetanus:

A. Decreased release of acetylcholine is not a characteristic of tetanus.

B. Inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels is more related to the mechanism of action of local anesthetics.

C. Destruction of Schwann cells is related to demyelinating diseases, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome.

E. Destruction of anterior horn cells is related to poliomyelitis.

It's essential to note that neonatal tetanus is often associated with poor umbilical cord care and lack of maternal immunization, which is consistent with the patient's mother not receiving prenatal care.",Success
"A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of progressive pain and stiffness of the fingers of her right hand. The stiffness is worse at the end of the day. She recently retired after working for 28 years as a typist at a data entry firm. Physical examination shows swelling, joint-line tenderness, and decreased range of motion of the first metacarpophalangeal joint and the distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand. Discrete, hard, mildly tender nodules are palpated over the 2nd and 4th distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand. An x-ray of her right hand shows narrowing of the interphalangeal joint spaces with subchondral sclerosis and osteophytes. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Degenerative disease of the joints.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as progressive pain and stiffness of the fingers, swelling, joint-line tenderness, and decreased range of motion, are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA). The presence of discrete, hard, mildly tender nodules over the distal interphalangeal joints, also known as Heberden's nodes, is a characteristic feature of OA. The x-ray findings of narrowing of the interphalangeal joint spaces with subchondral sclerosis and osteophytes further support the diagnosis of OA.

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of articular cartilage, leading to bone-on-bone contact and the formation of osteophytes. It is a common condition that affects weight-bearing joints, as well as the hands, particularly in individuals with a history of repetitive strain or trauma, such as the patient's 28-year history of typing.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Monosodium urate crystal precipitation in the joints is characteristic of gout, which typically presents with sudden, severe joint pain and swelling, often affecting the big toe.

B. Bacterial infection of the joint space would likely present with signs of infection, such as fever, redness, and warmth around the affected joint.

C. Autoimmune-mediated cartilage erosion is characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis, which typically presents with symmetric joint involvement, morning stiffness, and systemic symptoms.

D. Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal precipitation in the joints is characteristic of pseudogout, which typically presents with sudden, severe joint pain and swelling, often affecting the knees or wrists.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely underlying mechanism of her condition is degenerative disease of the joints, specifically osteoarthritis.",Success
"An 81-year-old man patient recently moved into an assisted living facility and presents today with itchy blisters in his axilla. He attributes these to a poor diet. He also complains that the nurse practitioner at the facility started him on 4 new medications, in addition to his existing prescriptions. On physical examination, tense axillary bullae are noted that do not rupture with light, gloved touch. On direct immunofluorescence, linear C3 and IgG deposits are seen along the basement membrane. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Bullous pemphigoid.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as itchy blisters in the axilla, are consistent with bullous pemphigoid.
* The physical examination finding of tense axillary bullae that do not rupture with light, gloved touch suggests a subepidermal blistering disorder, which is characteristic of bullous pemphigoid.
* The direct immunofluorescence findings of linear C3 and IgG deposits along the basement membrane are also consistent with bullous pemphigoid.

Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disorder that typically affects older adults, which fits the patient's demographics. The condition is characterized by the formation of autoantibodies against the hemidesmosomal proteins BP180 and BP230, leading to the separation of the epidermis from the dermis and the formation of blisters.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

* A. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a bacterial infection that typically affects children and is characterized by a diffuse, tender erythema and superficial blisters. The patient's age and the presence of tense bullae make this diagnosis less likely.
* B. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a severe, life-threatening skin reaction that is often caused by medications. While the patient has recently started new medications, the presence of linear IgG deposits on direct immunofluorescence makes this diagnosis less likely.
* D. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune blistering disorder that typically affects the mucous membranes and skin. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with pemphigus vulgaris.
* E. Cicatricial pemphigoid is a variant of bullous pemphigoid that affects the mucous membranes, particularly the eyes. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with cicatricial pemphigoid.

Overall, the combination of the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and direct immunofluorescence results make bullous pemphigoid the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A previously healthy 18-year-old army recruit is brought to a military treatment facility because of a 3-week history of right foot pain. He recently started basic infantry training and has been running several kilometers daily. Initially, the pain only occurred while running, but now it is also present at rest. The pain is located diffusely over the right forefoot. Vital signs are within normal range. Examination shows mild swelling over the distal right forefoot. Pressing the metatarsal of the third right toe results in pain. He walks with an antalgic gait. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the right foot shows a slight loss of cortical density and callus formation at the third metatarsal shaft. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. Rest and acetaminophen.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings, including the diffuse pain over the right forefoot, mild swelling, and pain on pressing the metatarsal of the third right toe, are consistent with a stress fracture of the third metatarsal shaft. The x-ray findings of slight loss of cortical density and callus formation also support this diagnosis.

The most appropriate next step in management is to provide conservative treatment, which includes rest and pain management with acetaminophen. Stress fractures are typically treated with a period of rest and avoidance of activities that exacerbate the condition. Acetaminophen can be used to manage pain and discomfort.

The other options are not necessary at this stage:

B. Ultrasonography is not typically used to diagnose stress fractures, and it would not provide additional information that would change the management plan.

C. Technetium bone scan may be used to diagnose stress fractures, but it is not necessary in this case, as the x-ray findings are already consistent with a stress fracture.

D. CT scan is not necessary for the diagnosis or management of a stress fracture.

E. Internal fixation is a surgical intervention that is not indicated for a stress fracture, especially in the early stages. Conservative management is usually the first line of treatment for stress fractures.

It's worth noting that the patient should be advised to avoid running and other high-impact activities until the symptoms resolve, and to gradually return to activities once the pain has subsided. Additionally, the patient may benefit from footwear modifications, orthotics, or physical therapy to address any biomechanical issues that may have contributed to the development of the stress fracture.",Success
"Thirty minutes after delivery, a 3600-g (7-lb 15-oz) newborn has noisy breathing, bluish discoloration of her lips, and intermittent respiratory distress. She was born at 38 weeks' gestation and required bag-mask resuscitation immediately after delivery. Pregnancy was uncomplicated. Her mother has noticed the bluish lip discoloration worsen when she fed and improve when she cried. The patient's pulse is 163/min, respirations are 62/min, and blood pressure is 60/30 mm Hg. The crying infant's lungs are clear to auscultation. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is D. Passage of a catheter through the nasal cavity not possible.

The symptoms described in the question, such as noisy breathing, bluish discoloration of the lips, and intermittent respiratory distress, are consistent with respiratory distress in a newborn. The fact that the bluish lip discoloration worsens when the infant is fed and improves when she cries suggests that the infant may have a congenital anomaly affecting the upper airway.

The passage of a gastric catheter through the mouth not being possible (Option C) would suggest esophageal atresia, which is not consistent with the symptoms described. A boot-shaped heart on chest x-ray (Option B) is characteristic of tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect that is not related to the symptoms described. Diffuse reticulogranular densities on chest x-ray (Option A) are more consistent with respiratory distress syndrome, which is not the primary diagnosis in this case. A scaphoid abdomen (Option E) is a sign of diaphragmatic hernia, which is not consistent with the symptoms described.

The correct diagnosis is likely choanal atresia, a congenital anomaly where the nasal passages are blocked or narrowed. This would explain why the bluish lip discoloration worsens when the infant is fed (due to increased nasal resistance) and improves when she cries (due to increased oral breathing). The passage of a catheter through the nasal cavity not being possible (Option D) is a diagnostic test that can confirm choanal atresia.",Success
"A 3-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her mother 30 minutes after the sudden onset of shortness of breath, dizziness, abdominal pain, and urticaria. The symptoms began 5 minutes after she ate a peanut butter sandwich. Her respirations are 36/min and blood pressure is 84/50 mm Hg. There is stridor on auscultation of the chest. She is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and the appropriate pharmacotherapy are begun. The drug administered to this patient most likely has which of the following effects on cardiac pacemaker cells during an action potential?",A,"The correct answer is E. Decreased K+ efflux during phase 3.

The patient is experiencing anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, likely due to a peanut allergy. The symptoms and signs, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, abdominal pain, urticaria, stridor, and hypotension, are consistent with anaphylaxis. The treatment of anaphylaxis typically involves administration of epinephrine, which is the most likely pharmacotherapy given to this patient.

Epinephrine has several effects on the cardiovascular system, including increasing heart rate and contractility. At the cellular level, epinephrine acts on cardiac pacemaker cells to increase the heart rate by decreasing the efflux of potassium ions (K+) during phase 3 of the action potential. This prolongs the duration of the action potential and increases the likelihood of spontaneous depolarization, leading to an increase in heart rate.

The other options are not correct:

A. Increased Ca2+ influx in phase 4: This is not a direct effect of epinephrine on cardiac pacemaker cells.

B. Increased Na+ influx in phase 3: This is not a direct effect of epinephrine on cardiac pacemaker cells.

C. Decreased Ca2+ influx in phase 0: This is not a direct effect of epinephrine on cardiac pacemaker cells.

D. Increased K+ efflux in phase 4: This would actually decrease the heart rate, which is opposite to the effect of epinephrine.

It's worth noting that the effects of epinephrine on cardiac pacemaker cells are complex and involve multiple mechanisms, including activation of β-adrenergic receptors and increased cyclic AMP production. However, in the context of anaphylaxis, the primary effect of epinephrine is to increase heart rate and contractility, which is mediated by decreasing K+ efflux during phase 3 of the action potential.",Success
"A 3-day-old boy is admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for seizures. He was born to a 33-year-old woman at 31 weeks gestation via cesarean section. His birth weight was 1400 grams. Vital signs are significant for systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and hypoventilation. On physical exam, the patient has an altered level of consciousness with decreased spontaneous and elicited movements. The patient is hypotonic on motor testing, has bulging anterior fontanelle, and appears cyanotic. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Cranial ultrasonography.

Justification:

The patient's presentation with seizures, systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and hypoventilation in the first 3 days of life suggests a diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). The physical exam findings of an altered level of consciousness, decreased movements, hypotonia, bulging anterior fontanelle, and cyanosis further support this diagnosis.

Cranial ultrasonography is a non-invasive, bedside imaging modality that is ideal for evaluating the neonatal brain, particularly in the setting of HIE. It can help identify cerebral edema, hemorrhage, and other structural abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Cranial ultrasonography is also useful for monitoring the progression of HIE and guiding management decisions.

While the other options may be useful in certain contexts, they are not the best next step in management for this patient:

A. Complete blood count (CBC) may be useful in evaluating for infection or other systemic disorders, but it is not directly related to the patient's neurological symptoms.

C. Electroencephalography (EEG) may be useful in evaluating the patient's seizure activity, but it is not as useful in evaluating the underlying structural abnormalities that may be contributing to the seizures.

D. Head CT is not typically used in the evaluation of neonatal HIE, as it exposes the patient to radiation and may not provide as detailed information about the brain as cranial ultrasonography or MRI.

E. MRI of the head may be useful in evaluating the patient's brain abnormalities, but it is not as readily available or practical for bedside evaluation as cranial ultrasonography. Additionally, MRI may require sedation and transportation of the patient, which can be risky in a critically ill neonate.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend cranial ultrasonography as a key diagnostic tool in the evaluation of neonatal HIE.",Success
"A 39-year-old man seeks an evaluation in the emergency room due to an episode of syncope at work. He says that he has felt increasing shortness of breath while exercising over the past 6 months. He is a well-built man in mild distress. The vital signs include heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 18/min, temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), and blood pressure 135/90 mm Hg. The cardiac examination is significant for a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border which is accentuated by forceful expiration against a closed airway. Palpation of the carotid artery shows 2 closely spaced pulses which occur during systole. Which of the following is most consistent with these findings?",D,"The correct answer is B. Aortic stenosis.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath during exercise and syncope are consistent with aortic stenosis, which can cause decreased cardiac output and reduced blood flow to the brain.
* The physical examination findings are also consistent with aortic stenosis:
	+ The harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border is a classic finding in aortic stenosis, and its accentuation by forceful expiration against a closed airway (Valsalva maneuver) is a characteristic feature.
	+ The palpation of the carotid artery showing 2 closely spaced pulses during systole is known as a ""bisferiens pulse,"" which is often seen in aortic stenosis due to the rapid ejection of blood through the stenotic valve.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

* A. Aortic dissection: While aortic dissection can cause syncope, the physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. Aortic dissection typically presents with a tearing chest pain, and the murmur is usually not systolic.
* C. Cardiac tamponade: This diagnosis is unlikely given the patient's vital signs, which do not show signs of hemodynamic compromise (e.g., tachycardia, hypotension). Additionally, the physical examination findings are not consistent with cardiac tamponade, which typically presents with a soft or absent heart sound, not a loud systolic murmur.
* D. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: While this diagnosis can cause syncope and a systolic murmur, the murmur is typically loudest at the apex, not the left lower sternal border. Additionally, the bisferiens pulse is not typically seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
* E. Third-degree heart block: This diagnosis is unlikely given the patient's heart rate, which is not significantly bradycardic. Additionally, third-degree heart block typically presents with a regular, slow heart rate, not a normal heart rate with a systolic murmur.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, aortic stenosis is the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 26-year-old nullipara presents to her physician for a routine check-up at 18 weeks gestation. She has no co-morbidities. Her only complaints are fatigability and a depressed mood for the past 2 weeks. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 125/80 mm Hg; heart rate, 87/min; respiratory rate, 14/min; and temperature, 36.7℃ (98℉). The physical examination is unremarkable and the gynecologic examination is consistent with 18 weeks gestation. A thyroid profile s ordered to check for a possible cause of the fatigability and decreased mood:
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.3 mU/L
Total T4 160 nmol/L
Free T4 13 pmol/L
Corresponding to the obtained results, how should the patient be managed?",B,"The correct answer is C. Recommend additional anti-TPO test.

Here's why:

The patient's thyroid profile shows a suppressed TSH (0.3 mU/L) with elevated total T4 (160 nmol/L) and free T4 (13 pmol/L) levels. This suggests hyperthyroidism, which can cause symptoms like fatigability and mood changes.

The next step in management would be to determine the cause of the hyperthyroidism. In pregnancy, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism is Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (anti-TPO).

Before initiating treatment, it's essential to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of hyperthyroidism, such as gestational transient thyrotoxicosis or thyroiditis. Measuring anti-TPO antibodies can help diagnose Graves' disease and guide further management.

Option A, prescribing levothyroxine, is incorrect because the patient has hyperthyroidism, not hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine is used to treat hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism.

Option B, no specific management required, is incorrect because the patient's thyroid profile indicates hyperthyroidism, which requires further evaluation and management to prevent potential complications for both the mother and the fetus.

Option D, prescribing methimazole, is incorrect because while methimazole is an antithyroid medication used to treat hyperthyroidism, it should not be initiated without a confirmed diagnosis of Graves' disease or other forms of hyperthyroidism.

Option E, recommending additional T3 assessment, is not necessary at this point, as the patient's free T4 level is already elevated, indicating hyperthyroidism. Measuring T3 levels may be useful in certain situations, but it's not the next step in this patient's management.

Therefore, the correct answer is C, recommending an additional anti-TPO test to help diagnose the underlying cause of the patient's hyperthyroidism.",Success

His blood pressure is 115/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 65/min, and the temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F). The patient states that he has been having trouble chewing his food, but is not experiencing any pain. The patient is up to date on all of his immunizations. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his facial swelling?",B,"The correct answer is B. Benign salivary gland tumor composed of stromal and epithelial tissue.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the progressive right-sided facial swelling without erythema, lymphadenopathy, or pain, suggest a benign tumor rather than an infectious or inflammatory process. The patient's trouble chewing food also points towards a mechanical obstruction or compression of the salivary gland.

Given the patient's recent travel to India, one might consider infectious causes such as paramyxovirus (option C), which can cause facial swelling. However, the absence of fever, lymphadenopathy, and other systemic symptoms makes this less likely.

Sialolithiasis (option E) is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a mass effect rather than an acute infection. Benign cystic tumors with stroma resembling lymph node tissue (option A) are not typically associated with facial swelling or compression of the salivary gland.

The most likely diagnosis is a pleomorphic adenoma, which is a benign salivary gland tumor composed of stromal and epithelial tissue (option B). This type of tumor is the most common benign tumor of the salivary glands and can cause facial swelling and compression of surrounding structures.

Malignant tumors composed of squamous and mucinous cells (option D) are less likely given the patient's lack of pain, fever, and other systemic symptoms, as well as the gradual progression of symptoms over a month.",Success
"A 15-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother. His mother reports multiple instances over the past month when she walked into his room while he was masturbating. She is worried he may be going through some sort of “problem.” He is currently in 9th grade; his mother says that he is the captain of his high school wrestling team and does reasonably well in school. On examination, he seems embarrassed and avoids making eye contact. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Reassure the mother.

Explanation:

Masturbation is a normal and healthy part of human sexuality, especially during adolescence. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) states that masturbation is a common and normal behavior in children and adolescents, and it is not a sign of any underlying psychological or emotional problem.

In this scenario, the boy's behavior is not indicative of any underlying issue, and his physical examination is normal. The mother's concern is likely due to a lack of understanding or discomfort with her son's normal sexual development.

Reassuring the mother that her son's behavior is normal and not a cause for concern is the most appropriate next step. This approach addresses the mother's anxiety and avoids stigmatizing or pathologizing the boy's behavior.

The other options are not supported by evidence:

A. Advising the patient to stop masturbating is not appropriate, as it is a normal behavior and may lead to feelings of guilt or shame.

B. Measuring serum testosterone levels is not indicated, as there is no suggestion of any hormonal imbalance or abnormality.

C. Referring the patient for behavioral therapy is not necessary, as there is no evidence of any underlying psychological issue.

E. Prescribing sertraline (an antidepressant medication) is not indicated, as there is no evidence of depression or any other condition that would warrant medication.

By reassuring the mother and providing education on normal adolescent development, the healthcare provider can help alleviate her concerns and promote a healthy and positive relationship with her son.",Success
"A 64-year-old man presents to the clinic with easy fatigability and breathlessness when climbing stairs for the last 2 weeks.

He denies shortness of breath at rest, palpitations, and loss of consciousness. He has had hypertension for the last 20 years and is on antihypertensive medications. On physical examination, his temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 104/min, blood pressure is 122/82 mm Hg, and respirations are 18/min. Chest auscultation reveals crackles over the lung bases bilaterally. Examination of his abdomen reveals mildly tender hepatomegaly. Laboratory investigation results include a hemoglobin of 14.8 g/dL (9.18 mmol/L) and an elevated serum B-type natriuretic peptide. His two-dimensional echocardiogram reveals an enlarged left atrium and an ejection fraction of 55%. Which of the following novel drugs is most likely to benefit the patient in addition to valsartan?",D,"The correct answer is D. Sacubitril.

The patient's symptoms, such as easy fatigability, breathlessness when climbing stairs, and cough at night relieved by sitting upright, suggest heart failure. The physical examination findings, including crackles over the lung bases bilaterally and mildly tender hepatomegaly, support this diagnosis. The laboratory results, including an elevated serum B-type natriuretic peptide, and the echocardiogram findings, including an enlarged left atrium and an ejection fraction of 55%, also point towards heart failure.

Sacubitril is a neprilysin inhibitor that is used in combination with valsartan (an angiotensin receptor blocker) to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The PARADIGM-HF trial demonstrated that sacubitril-valsartan reduced cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with HFrEF compared to enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. The patient's ejection fraction of 55% suggests that they may have HFrEF, making sacubitril-valsartan a suitable treatment option.

Etanercept (Option A) is a tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor used to treat autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, but it is not indicated for heart failure.

Ivabradine (Option B) is a heart rate-lowering agent used to treat chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, but it is not typically used in combination with valsartan.

Moxonidine (Option C) is a central sympatholytic agent used to treat hypertension, but it is not indicated for heart failure.

Aliskiren (Option E) is a direct renin inhibitor used to treat hypertension, but it is not typically used in combination with valsartan, and its use in heart failure is not well established.

Therefore, sacubitril (Option D) is the most likely to benefit the patient in addition to valsartan.",Success
"A 69-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for trouble sleeping. The patient states that he recently retired from working the day shift at a cemetery. When the patient retired, his goal was to finally be able to go out with his wife; however, he finds that he is unable to stay awake past 6 pm in the evening. His inability to stay awake has been straining his marriage as his wife is disappointed that they cannot do any activities in the evening together. The patient has tried drinking caffeine but finds that it does not help. The patient’s wife claims that the patient seems to sleep peacefully, and the patient states he feels rested when he awakes. The patient has a past medical history of irritable bowel syndrome which is managed with fiber supplements. The patient’s neurological exam is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Advanced sleep phase disorder.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as feeling rested upon waking and sleeping peacefully, suggest that he is not experiencing insomnia or sleep apnea. The patient's inability to stay awake past 6 pm in the evening, despite trying caffeine, points towards an advanced sleep phase disorder.

Advanced sleep phase disorder (ASPD) is a circadian rhythm sleep disorder characterized by a consistent sleep-wake cycle that is advanced relative to the conventional sleep-wake cycle. People with ASPD tend to fall asleep early in the evening (typically between 6-9 pm) and wake up early in the morning (typically between 2-5 am). This disorder is more common in older adults, which is consistent with the patient's age.

Delayed sleep phase disorder (option B) would involve the patient going to bed later and waking up later, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Chronic insomnia (option D) would involve difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, which is not described in the patient's symptoms.

Obstructive sleep apnea (option A) is a sleep disorder characterized by repetitive episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep, leading to disrupted sleep and daytime sleepiness. While the patient is sleepy during the day, there is no indication of disrupted sleep or other symptoms consistent with sleep apnea.

Normal aging (option E) is not a specific sleep disorder, and while it is true that sleep patterns can change with age, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a specific circadian rhythm disorder, such as ASPD.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is likely unrelated to his sleep symptoms, as there is no clear connection between IBS and sleep disorders.",Success
"A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She feels well. Six months ago, she was vaccinated against influenza. Her last mammography 1 year ago showed no abnormalities. Two years ago, a pap smear and colonoscopy were normal. She has a history of hypertension. Her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 50 years. She emigrated from Japan 30 years ago. She has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for the last 18 years. She drinks 4–5 glasses of wine per day. She goes ballroom dancing twice each week. Her medications include enalapril and low-dose aspirin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 50 kg (110 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows a soft S4 gallop. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Dual-energy x-ray bone absorptiometry.

Justification:

The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, smoking, and a family history of myocardial infarction. She is also a heavy drinker and has a low body mass index (BMI). Given her age and risk factors, the most appropriate next step in management is to assess her bone density.

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for osteoporosis in women 65 years or older, but also suggests considering screening in postmenopausal women younger than 65 who have an increased risk of osteoporosis. The patient's low BMI, smoking history, and heavy alcohol consumption put her at increased risk for osteoporosis, making dual-energy x-ray bone absorptiometry (DXA) a reasonable next step.

The other options are not as relevant at this time:

A. Pap smear: The patient had a normal pap smear 2 years ago, and the USPSTF recommends screening every 3 years for women with normal cytology.

C. Abdominal ultrasonography: There is no indication for abdominal ultrasonography in this patient, as she has no symptoms or risk factors for abdominal pathology.

D. Low-dose chest CT: While the patient is a smoker, she has no symptoms or risk factors for lung cancer, and the USPSTF recommends annual low-dose CT screening for lung cancer in adults aged 50-80 who have a 20-pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years.

E. Transesophageal echocardiography: There is no indication for transesophageal echocardiography in this patient, as she has no symptoms or risk factors for cardiac disease beyond her hypertension, which is already being managed with enalapril and low-dose aspirin. The soft S4 gallop is a benign finding and does not warrant further cardiac evaluation at this time.",Success
"A 25-year-old female with Hodgkin's lymphoma presents with a several day history of edema. Lab studies show:

Serum Na+: 140 mmol/L
Serum K+: 3.5 mmol/L
Serum albumin: 1.9 g/dL
Total serum bilirubin: 1.0 mg/dL
Serum creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL

Urinalysis shows 4+ proteinuria and fatty casts. What is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Minimal change disease.

Here's why:

The patient presents with edema, proteinuria (4+), and fatty casts in the urine, which are all indicative of nephrotic syndrome. The laboratory results show hypoalbuminemia (1.9 g/dL), which is a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome.

Minimal change disease is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, and it is often associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma. The other options are less likely given the patient's presentation and laboratory results:

A. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a possibility, but it is less common than minimal change disease in adults, and it often presents with more severe hypertension and kidney dysfunction, which is not evident in this patient.

B. Membranous nephropathy is a possibility, but it is often associated with a more gradual onset of proteinuria, and the patient's presentation is more consistent with a rapid onset of nephrotic syndrome.

D. Amyloidosis is unlikely given the absence of other symptoms or signs suggestive of amyloidosis, such as kidney failure, cardiac involvement, or peripheral neuropathy.

E. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a type of glomerulonephritis that is often associated with immune complex deposition and complement activation, which is not consistent with the patient's laboratory results.

In summary, the patient's presentation and laboratory results are most consistent with minimal change disease, which is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, especially in the context of Hodgkin's lymphoma.",Success
A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of mild left-sided abdominal pain when lifting heavy objects that has developed over the past 6 months. He has had a weight loss of 41 kgs (90 lbs) in the past year. Physical examination shows a soft bulge inferior and lateral to the navel on the left. A CT scan of the abdomen of a patient with the same condition is shown. Which of the following muscles is located directly medial to the pathology seen on the CT scan?,D,"The correct answer is D. Rectus abdominis.

The CT scan shows a left inguinal hernia, which is a type of hernia that occurs when a part of the intestine bulges through a weak spot in the abdominal wall in the groin area. The hernia is located inferior and lateral to the navel on the left, which is consistent with the patient's physical examination findings.

The rectus abdominis muscle is a paired muscle that runs vertically down the front of the abdomen, and it is located directly medial to the inguinal canal, where the hernia is occurring. The other options are not correct because:

* A. Psoas major is a muscle located in the lumbar region, posterior to the abdominal cavity, and is not directly related to the inguinal canal.
* B. Internal oblique and C. External oblique are muscles that make up the abdominal wall, but they are located lateral to the rectus abdominis and not directly medial to the inguinal canal.
* E. Transverse abdominal is the deepest abdominal muscle, which lies posterior to the rectus abdominis and is not directly related to the inguinal canal.

It's worth noting that the patient's significant weight loss may have contributed to the development of the hernia, as the abdominal wall may have become weaker and more prone to herniation.",Success
"A 7-year-old woman presents shortly after her birthday with red scaly plaques over both ears. Her mother reports that the patient recently received a pair of fashionable silver earrings from her older sister as a birthday present. Physical examination is only significant for erythema and tenderness over the lobules of the ears bilaterally. Her vital signs show a blood pressure of 121/73 mm Hg, heart rate of 72/min, and a respiratory rate of 21/min. Her medical history is non-significant. Of the following options, which is the mechanism of this reaction?",D,"The correct answer is D. Type IV–cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as red scaly plaques over both ears, erythema, and tenderness, are consistent with an allergic contact dermatitis reaction. The recent exposure to silver earrings from her sister suggests an allergic reaction to the metal, which is a common allergen.

Type IV hypersensitivity reactions, also known as delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, are cell-mediated immune responses that occur 24-48 hours after exposure to an allergen. This type of reaction involves the activation of T-cells, which release cytokines and chemokines, leading to inflammation and tissue damage.

In this case, the patient's immune system is reacting to the silver in the earrings, leading to the development of an allergic contact dermatitis. This is a classic example of a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Type I hypersensitivity reactions are immediate reactions, typically occurring within minutes of exposure to an allergen, and are characterized by the release of histamine from mast cells and basophils. This type of reaction is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

B. Type II hypersensitivity reactions involve the binding of antibodies to antigens on the surface of cells, leading to cell destruction. This type of reaction is not relevant to the patient's symptoms.

C. Type III hypersensitivity reactions involve the formation of immune complexes, which can lead to tissue damage. While this type of reaction can cause skin lesions, it is not typically associated with allergic contact dermatitis.

E. Type III and IV mixed reactions are not a recognized category of hypersensitivity reactions.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Type IV–cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction.",Success
"A 34-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of colicky abdominal pain and diarrhea. He has bowel movements 10–12 times daily; the stool contains blood and mucus. He constantly has the urge to defecate. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the abdomen shows diffuse tenderness to palpation. Serum concentration of C-reactive protein is 20 mg/L (N<10). Colonoscopy shows a bleeding, ulcerated rectal mucosa with several pseudopolyps. Which of the following is this patient at greatest risk of developing?",C,"The correct answer is C. Colorectal cancer.

The patient's symptoms and colonoscopy findings are consistent with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis (UC), a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The presence of colicky abdominal pain, diarrhea with blood and mucus, and the urge to defecate are all characteristic symptoms of UC. The colonoscopy findings of a bleeding, ulcerated rectal mucosa with pseudopolyps further support this diagnosis.

Patients with ulcerative colitis are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer, particularly if they have had the disease for a long time or have extensive colonic involvement. The risk of colorectal cancer in patients with UC is higher than in the general population, with a cumulative incidence of 2% at 10 years, 8% at 20 years, and 18% at 30 years after diagnosis.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and diagnosis:

A. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a complication of certain bacterial infections, such as E. coli, and is not typically associated with ulcerative colitis.

B. Oral ulcers can occur in patients with IBD, but they are not a specific complication of ulcerative colitis.

D. Gastric cancer is not typically associated with ulcerative colitis.

E. Pancreatic cancer is not related to the patient's symptoms and diagnosis.

It's essential to note that patients with ulcerative colitis should undergo regular surveillance colonoscopies to monitor for dysplasia and cancer.",Success
"A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of a headache. The last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She also reports having a mild headache for 1 month. There has been a grape-like mass protruding from her vagina for the last 15 days. On examination, the fundus of the uterus is at the level of the umbilicus and no fetal heart sounds are heard. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 160/100 mm Hg, pulse rate 108/min. On USG examination, no fetal parts are seen. What will be the genotype of the substance which will be aspirated by dilation and evacuation?",E,"The correct answer is A. 69XXY.

Here's why:

The patient presents with a grape-like mass protruding from her vagina, which is likely a hydatidiform mole. A hydatidiform mole is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease that occurs when a non-viable fertilized egg implants in the uterus. The mass is composed of abnormal placental tissue and can cause symptoms such as vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and hypertension.

The ultrasound examination reveals no fetal parts, which supports the diagnosis of a hydatidiform mole. The genotype of a complete hydatidiform mole is typically 46XX or 46XY, but in this case, the correct answer is 69XXY.

A complete hydatidiform mole is usually diploid, with 46 chromosomes, but in some cases, it can be triploid, with 69 chromosomes. The triploid karyotype 69XXY is consistent with a partial hydatidiform mole, which is a type of molar pregnancy that contains both abnormal placental tissue and fetal tissue.

The other options are not correct:

* B. 45XO is a karyotype associated with Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects females.
* C. 23XX is not a valid karyotype for a human cell.
* D. 47XYY is a karyotype associated with Klinefelter syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects males.
* E. 46XX is a normal female karyotype, but it's not the correct answer in this scenario, as the patient has a hydatidiform mole, which has an abnormal karyotype.

It's essential to note that the management of a hydatidiform mole typically involves suction dilation and curettage (D&C) to remove the abnormal tissue, followed by close monitoring for any signs of persistent gestational trophoblastic disease.",Success
"A 42-year-old woman comes to the clinic for a routine annual exam. She recently moved from New Jersey, and her medical records show a total colectomy. The patient reports that she has had annual colonoscopies since she was 10 years of age because her father had “a condition with his colon.” What is the genetic inheritance pattern of the patient’s disease?",A,"The correct answer is A. Autosomal dominant.

The patient's history of undergoing annual colonoscopies since the age of 10, along with her father's condition, suggests a strong family history of colon cancer or polyps. The fact that she had a total colectomy also implies that she had a significant colon condition, likely familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).

FAP is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of hundreds to thousands of colorectal adenomas, which can progress to cancer if left untreated. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene (in this case, the APC gene) is enough to cause the condition. This is supported by the fact that the patient's father had a similar condition, and she developed symptoms at a young age.

Autosomal dominant inheritance is characterized by the following features:

* A single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition
* Each affected person has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each offspring
* Males and females are equally affected
* The condition can be inherited from either parent

The other options are not consistent with the patient's history and the characteristics of FAP:

* Autosomal recessive (B) would require two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) to cause the condition, which is not the case here.
* Multifactorial (C) inheritance implies a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, which is not characteristic of FAP.
* X-linked dominant (D) and X-linked recessive (E) inheritance patterns are associated with genes located on the X chromosome, which is not the case for FAP.",Success
"A 2-day-old infant male is brought to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of vomiting and irritability. He was born at home and had unreliable prenatal care because his parents have been experiencing housing instability. About a day after birth, he started to become lethargic and was feeding poorly. His parents thought that he might just be tired so they put him to bed; however, by the next morning he started to vomit and act extremely irritable. On presentation, he is found to have nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelles. Based on this presentation, appropriate cultures are obtained and he is placed on empiric antibiotics. After all cultures grow out the same gram-positive bacteria, the patient is narrowed to penicillin G. Which of the following is a characteristic of the most likely organism that is causing this patient's symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is E. Tumbling motility in broth at 22 degrees.

Based on the patient's symptoms, particularly the presence of nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelles, the most likely organism causing the infection is Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause meningitis and sepsis in neonates, especially those with unreliable prenatal care or premature birth.

The characteristic that distinguishes Listeria monocytogenes from other gram-positive bacteria is its tumbling motility in broth at 22°C (room temperature). This is a unique feature of Listeria monocytogenes, which helps to differentiate it from other bacteria.

The other options are not characteristic of Listeria monocytogenes:

A. Creates a green zone of hemolysis on blood agar: This is characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae, not Listeria monocytogenes.

B. Enlarges hemolytic area of Staphylococcus aureus: This is not a characteristic of Listeria monocytogenes.

C. Produces lipooligosaccharide rather than lipopolysaccharide: This is characteristic of Neisseria meningitidis, not Listeria monocytogenes.

D. Produces toxin that increases cAMP levels: This is characteristic of Bacillus cereus, not Listeria monocytogenes.

Therefore, the correct answer is E. Tumbling motility in broth at 22 degrees.",Success
"A 58-year-old man with hypertension and dyslipidemia comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He says he feels well. He is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 103 kg (227 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. His BMI last year was 27 kg/m2. When asked about his diet, he says, “Being overweight runs in my family. Rather than fight it, I just try to enjoy myself and eat what I want.” Which of the following defense mechanisms best describes the patient's response to the physician?",A,"The correct answer is A. Rationalization.

Rationalization is a defense mechanism in which an individual creates logical explanations or excuses to justify their behavior, often to avoid taking responsibility or to reduce feelings of guilt or anxiety. In this scenario, the patient is using rationalization by attributing his weight gain to genetics (""Being overweight runs in my family"") and claiming that he ""just tries to enjoy himself and eat what I want."" This response implies that he is not responsible for his weight gain and that it's simply a result of his genetic predisposition, rather than acknowledging the role of his dietary choices.

Here's why the other options are not correct:

B. Primitive idealization: This defense mechanism involves attributing exaggerated positive qualities to someone or something. The patient's response does not involve idealizing anyone or anything.

C. Fantasy: This defense mechanism involves escaping into a world of fantasy to avoid dealing with reality. The patient's response is not an attempt to escape reality, but rather a justification of his behavior.

D. Distortion: This defense mechanism involves altering reality to fit one's own needs or desires. While the patient may be downplaying the role of his diet in his weight gain, his response is more of a rationalization than a distortion of reality.

E. Intellectualization: This defense mechanism involves focusing on abstract concepts or intellectual ideas to avoid dealing with emotions or personal issues. The patient's response is not an attempt to intellectualize his weight gain, but rather to justify it through rationalization.

It's essential to recognize defense mechanisms in patient interactions, as they can impact health outcomes and adherence to treatment plans. By acknowledging and addressing these defense mechanisms, healthcare providers can promote more effective communication and encourage patients to take a more active role in their health management.",Success
"A 27-year-old college student presents to his physician for constant fatigue. The patient states that for the past several weeks he has felt oddly fatigued and has struggled to complete his work.

Marijuana: Positive
Amphetamines: Positive
Cocaine: Positive

The patient refuses an examination of his genitals. Which of the following is the best diagnostic test?",D,"The correct answer is D. Viral core antibody.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss, along with the laboratory results, suggest a possible diagnosis of hepatitis. The elevated AST and ALT levels indicate liver damage, and the amber/brown color of the urine is consistent with bilirubinuria, which is often seen in hepatitis.

Given the patient's high-risk behavior, including unprotected sex with multiple partners, the most likely diagnosis is hepatitis B. The viral core antibody (anti-HBc) is a diagnostic test that detects the presence of antibodies against the hepatitis B core antigen. A positive result indicates current or past infection with hepatitis B.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. CAGE questions are a screening tool for alcoholism, which is not the primary concern in this case.

B. Direct influenza antigen is a test for influenza, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

C. Uretheral swab and culture may be relevant for a sexually transmitted infection (STI), but it is not the best diagnostic test for the patient's overall symptoms and laboratory results.

E. Viral surface antibody (anti-HBs) is a test that detects the presence of antibodies against the hepatitis B surface antigen, which is not as specific for diagnosing acute hepatitis B as the viral core antibody.

It's worth noting that the patient's refusal to undergo a genital examination may be related to concerns about STIs, and further evaluation and testing for STIs may be necessary. However, based on the provided information, the viral core antibody is the best diagnostic test to pursue.",Success
A 63-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion in addition to a 1-month history of ankle swelling. She has a history of sleep apnea. Examination of the lower extremities shows bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema. Cardiac examination shows a widely split S2 that varies with respiration. An ECG shows right bundle branch block. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema?,D,"The correct answer is D. Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with right-sided heart failure. The widely split S2 that varies with respiration and the presence of right bundle branch block on the ECG suggest right ventricular overload or failure. The bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema are also indicative of right-sided heart failure.

In right-sided heart failure, the increased pressure in the right ventricle is transmitted back to the systemic venous circulation, leading to increased capillary hydrostatic pressure. This increased pressure pushes fluid out of the capillaries and into the interstitial space, resulting in edema.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Localized lymphatic obstruction would cause unilateral edema, not bilateral edema.

B. Dermal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans is seen in conditions like myxedema, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

C. Thrombus formation in a deep vein would cause unilateral edema, not bilateral edema, and would likely be associated with pain and warmth in the affected leg.

E. Decreased plasma oncotic pressure, which can occur in conditions like nephrotic syndrome or liver disease, would cause edema, but it is not the most likely etiology in this patient given the presence of right-sided heart failure.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of sleep apnea may be contributing to the development of right-sided heart failure, as sleep apnea is a known risk factor for pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure.",Success
"A 62-year-old man presents with bright red blood in his stool which occurred 2 times this week. He denies fever, weight loss, pain, pruritus or urinary symptoms. Past medical history is significant for gastroesophageal reflux disease, and recent appendicitis, status post laparoscopic appendectomy complicated by delirium tremens. His vitals are a temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg, pulse of 78/min, and respiratory rate of 12/min. Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen with shifting dullness on percussion. In addition, multiple purple spider web-like lesions are present on the chest and arms, which blanch when pressure is applied. Fecal occult blood test is negative. On anoscopy, a non-tender, dilated vascular protrusion is noted superior to the pectinate line. Which of the following is most likely true about this patient’s current symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is C. The vascular protrusion drains into the inferior vena cava.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with hemorrhoids, specifically internal hemorrhoids. The bright red blood in the stool, lack of fever, weight loss, and pain, and the presence of a non-tender, dilated vascular protrusion on anoscopy superior to the pectinate line support this diagnosis.

The purple spider web-like lesions on the chest and arms that blanch with pressure are likely spider angiomas, which are associated with liver disease. The patient's history of delirium tremens after laparoscopic appendectomy suggests that he may have underlying liver disease or cirrhosis.

Internal hemorrhoids drain into the superior rectal vein, which ultimately drains into the inferior vena cava. This is why option C is the correct answer.

Option A is incorrect because there is no evidence of peptic ulcer disease in the patient's symptoms or physical examination.

Option B is incorrect because while internal hemorrhoids do drain into the superior rectal vein, this vein ultimately drains into the inferior vena cava, not the superior rectal vein itself.

Option D is incorrect because the inferior rectal vein drains into the pudendal vein, not the vascular protrusion seen in internal hemorrhoids.

Option E is incorrect because fecal leukocytes and a stool culture are not required for the diagnosis of hemorrhoids. The diagnosis is typically made based on symptoms and physical examination findings, as in this case.",Success

Laboratory studies are significant for the following:
Calcium 13.8 mg/dL
PTH 230 pg/mL
Her complete metabolic panel is otherwise within normal limits. Imaging studies show subperiosteal resorption and osteoporosis. Scintigraphy reveals the most common pathologic condition associated with the patient’s diagnosis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Adenoma.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging studies are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). The key findings that support this diagnosis are:

1. Elevated calcium levels (13.8 mg/dL) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (230 pg/mL), indicating excessive PTH production.
2. Subperiosteal resorption and osteoporosis on imaging studies, which are common radiographic features of PHPT.
3. The patient's symptoms of weakness and polyuria (excessive urination) are also consistent with PHPT.

In PHPT, a single abnormal parathyroid gland (adenoma) is the most common cause, accounting for approximately 80-90% of cases. This adenoma produces excessive PTH, leading to hypercalcemia and the associated symptoms.

The other options are not supported by the patient's presentation and laboratory results:

B. Carcinoma: While parathyroid carcinoma can cause PHPT, it is a rare condition, accounting for less than 1% of PHPT cases.

C. Decreased calcitriol concentration: Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

D. Glandular hyperplasia: While parathyroid hyperplasia can cause PHPT, it is less common than a single adenoma, and the patient's laboratory results and imaging studies are more consistent with a single adenoma.

E. Phosphate retention: Phosphate retention is not a direct cause of PHPT, and the patient's laboratory results do not suggest phosphate-related abnormalities.

Therefore, based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is a parathyroid adenoma (Option A).",Success

On exam, she is quiet with a flattened affect, but is cooperative and answers questions thoroughly. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Cyclothymic disorder.

Here's why:

The patient presents with a history of recurrent depressive episodes that last for 4-6 weeks, which is consistent with cyclothymic disorder. The episodes are not severe enough to meet the criteria for major depressive episodes, as she is still able to experience pleasure and enjoyment during some of these episodes. Additionally, she reports occasional episodes of elevated mood, which suggests a mood disorder with both depressive and hypomanic symptoms.

Cyclothymic disorder is a mood disorder characterized by periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms that are not severe enough to meet the criteria for major depressive episodes. The patient's symptoms fit this pattern, with periods of depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and poor appetite, as well as periods of elevated mood, increased productivity, and reduced need for sleep.

Bipolar I disorder (A) is unlikely, as the patient does not report any manic episodes, which are a hallmark of this condition. Bipolar II disorder (B) is also unlikely, as the patient's depressive episodes are not severe enough to meet the criteria for major depressive episodes.

Persistent depressive disorder (D) is a possibility, but it does not account for the patient's episodes of elevated mood. Schizoaffective disorder (E) is unlikely, as there is no evidence of psychotic symptoms in the patient's presentation.

She walks one mile daily. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 119/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. When compared to a healthy 20-year-old woman, which of the following changes in respiratory function is most likely present in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is none of the above.

As people age, several changes occur in respiratory function. In a healthy 76-year-old woman, the following changes are likely to be present:

* Decreased vital capacity (not increased): Lung volume and vital capacity decrease with age due to a decline in lung elasticity and an increase in chest wall stiffness.
* Increased residual volume (not decreased): Residual volume increases with age as the lungs lose their elasticity and become less efficient at expelling air.
* Decreased chest wall compliance (not increased): The chest wall becomes stiffer with age, making it more difficult for the lungs to expand.
* Increased A-a gradient (not decreased): The alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-a gradient) increases with age due to a decline in lung function and a decrease in the ability of the lungs to oxygenate the blood.

Lung compliance, which is the ability of the lungs to expand, decreases with age, so option A is incorrect.

It's essential to note that these changes are a normal part of the aging process and may not be clinically significant in an otherwise healthy individual. However, they can contribute to respiratory symptoms and decreased exercise tolerance in older adults.",Success
"A 32-year-old man jumps off a 3 story building during a suicide attempt. Paramedics arrive quickly, and he is taken to the hospital where several stable lumbar fractures and a shattered right calcaneus are found. He undergoes surgery and his calcaneus is repaired with 11 screws. Which of the following statements best describes the long term post-surgery outcome in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. He will have pain with inversion and eversion of his foot.

The patient has undergone surgery to repair a shattered right calcaneus, which is a complex bone in the heel that plays a crucial role in weight-bearing and ankle movement. The calcaneus is responsible for transmitting forces from the talus bone to the cuboid bone, allowing for inversion (turning inward) and eversion (turning outward) of the foot.

Given the severity of the injury and the need for 11 screws to repair the calcaneus, it is likely that the patient will experience long-term pain and stiffness in the affected foot, particularly with inversion and eversion movements. This is because the calcaneus is a weight-bearing bone, and any disruption to its anatomy can lead to chronic pain and instability.

The other options are not directly related to the calcaneus injury and surgery:

A. Plantar flexion is a movement controlled by the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, which are not directly affected by the calcaneus injury.

B. Toe pointing is a movement controlled by the intrinsic muscles of the foot, which are also not directly affected by the calcaneus injury.

C. Foot drop is a condition characterized by weakness or paralysis of the muscles that lift the foot, typically due to nerve damage. While it's possible that the patient may experience some weakness or numbness in the foot due to nerve damage during the fall, it is not a direct consequence of the calcaneus injury.

E. Dorsiflexion is a movement controlled by the anterior tibialis muscle, which is not directly affected by the calcaneus injury.

Therefore, option D is the most likely long-term outcome for this patient.",Success

India ink stain shows organisms with prominent capsules. Blood cultures are drawn. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's neurological symptoms?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Amphotericin B and flucytosine.

Justification:

The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and CSF analysis are consistent with Cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in HIV-positive individuals. The India ink stain showing organisms with prominent capsules is a characteristic feature of Cryptococcus neoformans.

The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for Cryptococcal meningitis is a combination of Amphotericin B and flucytosine. Amphotericin B is a polyene antifungal that is effective against Cryptococcus, while flucytosine is a synthetic antifungal that inhibits DNA synthesis in fungal cells. This combination therapy is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the treatment of Cryptococcal meningitis in HIV-positive patients.

Option A is incorrect because pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid are used to treat Toxoplasmosis, another opportunistic infection in HIV-positive individuals.

Option C is incorrect because fluconazole is an azole antifungal that is effective against Candida species, but it is not the treatment of choice for Cryptococcal meningitis.

Option D is incorrect because vancomycin and meropenem are antibacterial agents used to treat bacterial infections, not fungal infections like Cryptococcal meningitis.

Option E is incorrect because valacyclovir is an antiviral agent used to treat herpesvirus infections, not fungal infections like Cryptococcal meningitis.",Success
"A previously healthy 16-year-old boy comes to the physician because of a 5-day history of pain at the back of his left ankle. His mother had a myocardial infarction at 54 years. His BMI is 23 kg/m2. There is tenderness above the left posterior calcaneus and a firm, 3-cm, skin-colored nodule that moves with the left Achilles tendon. A photomicrograph from a biopsy of the nodule is shown. Serum studies in this patient are most likely to show increased levels of which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is D. Low-density lipoprotein.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including the firm, skin-colored nodule that moves with the Achilles tendon, are consistent with a subcutaneous Achilles tendon xanthoma. The photomicrograph from the biopsy likely shows lipid-laden macrophages, which are characteristic of xanthomas.

Subcutaneous Achilles tendon xanthomas are often associated with familial hypercholesterolemia, an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by severely elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The patient's family history of premature myocardial infarction in his mother at 54 years old also supports this diagnosis.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and diagnosis:

A. Uric acid is associated with gout, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

B. Rheumatoid factor is associated with rheumatoid arthritis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

C. Angiotensin-converting enzyme is associated with sarcoidosis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

E. Triglycerides may be elevated in certain lipid disorders, but they are not specifically associated with subcutaneous Achilles tendon xanthomas or familial hypercholesterolemia.

"A 3-year-old boy presents with episodic diarrhea with malodorous stools, stunted growth, occasional abdominal cramps, and an itchy rash. His mother says that these symptoms developed approximately 2 years ago. The patient was exclusively breastfed up to the age of 7 months. Supplementary feeding was started with non-starchy vegetable followed by starchy vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, and bread. Bread and cookies were the last product to be introduced at the age of 12 months. The patient’s mother tried to withdraw dairy products from the patient’s diet because she heard that lactose can cause such symptoms, but it did not help. The patient’s vital signs include: blood pressure 90/55 mm Hg, heart rate 101/min, respiratory rate 19/min, and temperature 36.3℃ (97.3℉). His weight is 11 kg (24.2 lb, -2 SD) and height is 90 cm (2 ft 11 in, -1 SD). On physical examination, the patient’s skin is pale with a papulovesicular rash on his abdomen and back. There are a few aphthous ulcers in the oral cavity. The abdomen is distended but no tenderness to palpation. No hepatosplenomegaly. An immunological assay is performed and shows positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies. Which of the following changes would you most likely expect to see on intestinal biopsy in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy.

The patient's symptoms, such as episodic diarrhea, malodorous stools, stunted growth, abdominal cramps, and itchy rash, are consistent with celiac disease. The presence of positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies further supports this diagnosis. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes an immune-mediated response to gluten, leading to inflammation and damage in the small intestine.

On intestinal biopsy, the characteristic findings in celiac disease include villous atrophy, crypt hypertrophy, and an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes. Villous atrophy refers to the flattening of the villi, which are the finger-like projections in the small intestine responsible for nutrient absorption. Crypt hypertrophy refers to the increased size of the crypts, which are the areas between the villi where new epithelial cells are produced.

The other options are not characteristic of celiac disease:

A. Granulomas in the submucous tissue are more commonly seen in conditions such as Crohn's disease or sarcoidosis.

B. Crypt abscesses are typically seen in inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.

D. Mucosal eosinophilia is more commonly associated with eosinophilic gastroenteritis or food allergies.

E. Villous hyperplasia is not a characteristic finding in celiac disease.

It's worth noting that the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings are consistent with celiac disease, and the patient's failure to respond to dairy product withdrawal suggests that lactose intolerance is not the underlying cause of the symptoms.",Success
"An 18-year-old patient is visiting the pediatrician with her mother for her annual exam before college starts.

She is very shy and withdrawn with the physician. Afterwards, her mother asks to speak to the physician alone and expresses concern that her daughter is very socially isolated and feels lonely. She is also worried that her daughter is extremely sensitive to criticism, even from family. The daughter is interested in art and music, but hasn’t participated in any extracurriculars because she says that she is untalented and thinks nobody wants to hang out with her. When her mother has encouraged her to invite friends over, the daughter bursts into tears and says, “Nobody wants to be friends with me, I am too lame and ugly and I just know I’ll end up getting rejected.” Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the daughter’s behavior?",C,"The correct answer is C. Avoidant personality disorder.

The patient's behavior and symptoms are consistent with avoidant personality disorder, which is characterized by feelings of inadequacy, social inhibition, and fear of rejection or criticism. The patient's shy and withdrawn nature, extreme sensitivity to criticism, and avoidance of social interactions due to fear of rejection or ridicule are all hallmarks of this disorder.

The patient's reluctance to participate in extracurricular activities, despite her interest in art and music, and her negative self-talk about being ""untalented"" and ""lame"" also support this diagnosis. Additionally, her intense emotional response to her mother's encouragement to invite friends over, resulting in tears and catastrophic thinking, is consistent with the avoidant personality disorder's characteristic fear of rejection and criticism.

While schizotypal personality disorder (A) may share some similarities with avoidant personality disorder, it is characterized by more pronounced cognitive and perceptual distortions, which are not evident in this patient's presentation.

Generalized anxiety disorder (B) is a possible comorbid condition, but it does not fully explain the patient's pervasive social avoidance and fear of rejection.

Paranoid personality disorder (D) is characterized by a pervasive distrust and suspiciousness of others, which is not evident in this patient's presentation.

Dependent personality disorder (E) is characterized by an excessive need to be taken care of, which is not a prominent feature in this patient's behavior.

The lesions turn white on application of 3% acetic acid. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?,E,"The correct answer is E. Vaccination.

The patient's symptoms, specifically the presence of hyperkeratotic exophytic papules over the vulva that turn white on application of 3% acetic acid, are consistent with genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). 

HPV vaccination is a preventive measure that can protect against certain types of HPV that cause genital warts and cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine is recommended for all preteens (both boys and girls) at age 11-12 years, and can be given up to age 26 for those who did not receive the vaccine at a younger age.

Condoms (Option A) can reduce the transmission of HPV, but they are not 100% effective, especially if they are not used consistently.

Anti-HIV prophylaxis (Option B) is not related to the prevention of HPV or genital warts.

Spermicidal foam (Option C) is a form of contraception, but it does not provide protection against HPV.

Famciclovir therapy (Option D) is an antiviral medication used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, not HPV.

Abdominal ultrasonography shows an enlarged liver. A biopsy of the liver shows massive centrilobular necrosis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?""",D,"The correct answer is D. Adverse effect of anesthetic.

Here's a breakdown of the patient's symptoms and laboratory results that support this answer:

* The patient developed fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain 1 day after receiving general inhalational anesthesia during an appendectomy.
* The laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, particularly aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which is indicative of hepatocellular injury.
* The liver biopsy reveals massive centrilobular necrosis, which is consistent with a toxic or anesthetic-induced injury.
* The patient's bilirubin levels are elevated, with a direct bilirubin level of 3.1 mg/dL, suggesting cholestasis.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

* A. Acalculous inflammation of the gallbladder: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a primary gallbladder problem. The ultrasound shows an enlarged liver, but there is no mention of gallstones or gallbladder wall thickening.
* B. Virus-mediated hepatocellular injury: The patient's serology results show that she has been previously exposed to hepatitis A (anti-HAV IgG positive) and has immunity to hepatitis B (anti-HBs positive). However, there is no evidence of active viral hepatitis, and the liver biopsy does not suggest a viral etiology.
* C. Trauma to the bile duct: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a bile duct injury. The ultrasound shows an enlarged liver, but there is no mention of bile duct dilation or obstruction.
* E. Gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest sepsis or gram-negative bacteremia. The fever and abdominal pain are more consistent with a toxic or anesthetic-induced injury.

"A 10-year-old African American girl with known sickle cell disease becomes acutely anemic in the setting of underlying infection. Her mother denies any previous history of blood clots in her past, but she says that her mother has also had to be treated for pulmonary embolism in the recent past.

The vital signs upon arrival include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 106/74 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min and regular, and respiratory rate 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding and fingernails are pale, but breath sounds remain clear. Oxygen saturation was initially 91% on room air and electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus tachycardia. A blood transfusion is initiated. Shortly after the transfusion has begun, the patient experiences fevers, chills, a burning sensation at the intravenous (IV) site, and sudden hypotension. What is the name of this reaction, and what is the best treatment?",E,"The correct answer is E. Hemolytic transfusion reaction; discontinue transfusion.

This patient is experiencing a hemolytic transfusion reaction, which is a severe and life-threatening reaction that occurs when the recipient's immune system attacks the transfused red blood cells. The symptoms include fever, chills, and hypotension, which are consistent with the patient's presentation. The burning sensation at the IV site is also a common feature of hemolytic transfusion reactions.

The best treatment for a hemolytic transfusion reaction is to immediately discontinue the transfusion to prevent further hemolysis and potential kidney damage. Antihistamines are not effective in treating hemolytic transfusion reactions, and administering them would not address the underlying issue.

Option A is incorrect because a minor allergic reaction would not typically cause hypotension and would likely respond to antihistamines. Option B is also incorrect because a nonhemolytic febrile reaction would not cause hypotension and would typically respond to antipyretics and antihistamines. Option C is incorrect because discontinuing the transfusion alone would not address the underlying reaction, and antihistamines would not be effective in this scenario. Option D is incorrect because antihistamines would not be effective in treating a hemolytic transfusion reaction.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of sickle cell disease and splenectomy increases her risk of developing a hemolytic transfusion reaction, and the fact that her mother has a history of pulmonary embolism is not directly related to the patient's current reaction.",Success

Justification:

The patient's symptoms, including widespread muscle and joint pain, morning stiffness, fatigue, and tingling sensation in the lower limbs, are consistent with fibromyalgia. The physical examination findings of symmetric muscular tenderness at the base of the neck, over the shoulders, and in the lumbosacral area also support this diagnosis.

Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is commonly used to treat fibromyalgia. It has been shown to be effective in reducing pain, improving sleep, and enhancing quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia.

The other options are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Bupropion is an antidepressant, but it is not typically used to treat fibromyalgia.

B. Temazepam is a benzodiazepine that may be used to treat insomnia, but it is not a first-line treatment for fibromyalgia.

C. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause symptoms similar to fibromyalgia, but the patient's laboratory results do not suggest a deficiency.

E. Methotrexate is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but it is not typically used to treat fibromyalgia.

He reports a 20-pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F), pulse is 96/min, blood pressure is 108/78 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical examination, auscultation of the chest reveals rhonchi and crepitus over the right lung. The remainder of the exam is unremarkable. A chest radiograph reveals a mass in the middle lobe of the right lung. Which of the following clinical signs would most likely be present in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is A. Bilateral pedal edema.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the facial swelling, cough, and difficulty breathing, suggest a diagnosis of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. SVC syndrome is a condition where the superior vena cava is compressed or obstructed, often due to a tumor or lymph node enlargement. In this case, the mass in the middle lobe of the right lung is likely causing compression of the SVC.

One of the common clinical signs of SVC syndrome is bilateral pedal edema, which is caused by the obstruction of venous return from the upper body. This leads to increased pressure in the venous system, resulting in edema in the lower extremities.

The other options are not directly related to SVC syndrome:

B. Distended veins over the lower abdomen are more commonly seen in inferior vena cava obstruction or Budd-Chiari syndrome.

C. Papilledema is a sign of increased intracranial pressure, which is not typically associated with SVC syndrome.

D. A positive Adson test is a sign of thoracic outlet syndrome, which is a compression of the brachial plexus or subclavian artery.

E. Sensory loss over the ulnar aspect of the right forearm and right hand is a sign of cubital tunnel syndrome or ulnar nerve entrapment, which is not related to SVC syndrome.

Physical examination is significant for localized tenderness to palpation over the left anteromedial proximal tibia, 6 cm inferior to the joint line. There is no joint effusion noted. Valgus stress testing is negative for any pain or instability of the knee joint. Radiographs of the left knee are obtained and reveal only mild arthritis, without evidence of any fractures or bony lesions. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Pes anserine bursitis.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms are consistent with pes anserine bursitis, which is a common condition characterized by pain and tenderness over the anteromedial proximal tibia, typically 6-8 cm inferior to the joint line.
* The patient's description of pain on the inside part of the knee and below the kneecap is consistent with this diagnosis.
* The physical examination finding of localized tenderness to palpation over the left anteromedial proximal tibia supports this diagnosis.
* The valgus stress testing being negative for pain or instability of the knee joint makes medial meniscus tear (option B) and medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain (option C) less likely.
* Stress fracture of the proximal tibia (option A) is possible, but the radiographs did not reveal any evidence of fracture, making this diagnosis less likely.
* Patellar tendonitis (option E) typically presents with pain and tenderness over the patellar tendon, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Pes anserine bursitis is a common condition that affects the bursa located over the anteromedial proximal tibia, and it is often seen in overweight or obese individuals, which is consistent with the patient's demographics.

"A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician’s office with concerns about a recent pregnancy. She and her boyfriend had intercourse for the first time a few weeks ago. Two weeks ago she missed her menstrual period. She took several over the counter pregnancy tests that confirmed her pregnancy. She is tearful about the pregnancy and is very concerned. After extensive conversations with her physician and counseling, she decides she wants to medically abort her 6-week pregnancy. Which of the following drugs should be administered to this patient for this purpose?",D,"The correct answer is D. Mifepristone.

Mifepristone, also known as RU-486, is a medication specifically approved for medical abortion, also known as medication abortion or non-surgical abortion. It is used to terminate early pregnancies, typically up to 10 weeks of gestation. Mifepristone works by blocking the action of progesterone, a hormone necessary for pregnancy to continue. This leads to the detachment of the embryo from the uterine lining, and the pregnancy is terminated.

The other options are not appropriate for medical abortion:

A. Megestrol is a progestin medication used to treat various conditions, including breast cancer and endometrial cancer, but it is not used for medical abortion.

B. Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used to treat breast cancer, but it is not indicated for medical abortion.

C. Terbutaline is a beta-agonist medication used to treat asthma and other respiratory conditions, as well as to delay preterm labor. It is not used for medical abortion.

E. Copper intrauterine device (IUD) is a form of contraception, not a medication used for medical abortion.

A CT scan of the head at that time showed no abnormalities and she was released without further treatment. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Her best corrected visual acuity is 20/40 in each eye. She has an adduction deficit in the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left; she has an adduction deficit in the left eye and nystagmus in the right eye when looking right. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral disc hyperemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?",A,"The correct answer is D. Subdural hematoma extending into the orbit.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including periodic painful double vision, adduction deficits, and nystagmus, suggest a problem with the cranial nerves responsible for eye movement, particularly the oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV), and abducens (VI) nerves. The bilateral disc hyperemia on fundoscopy also points towards increased intracranial pressure.

Given the patient's recent history of head trauma from a bike fall, a subdural hematoma is a likely cause of her symptoms. A subdural hematoma is a collection of blood between the dura mater and the arachnoid mater, which can compress the brain and cranial nerves. In this case, the hematoma may be extending into the orbit, affecting the nerves responsible for eye movement and causing the patient's symptoms.

Option A, demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, is unlikely as it would not typically cause painful double vision or adduction deficits. Option B, compressive tumor of the pons, is also unlikely as it would typically cause more widespread neurological symptoms and signs. Option C, oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency, is not supported by the patient's symptoms or history. Option E, infarction of the brainstem, is possible but less likely than a subdural hematoma given the patient's recent head trauma.

It's essential to note that this patient requires immediate attention and further evaluation, including imaging studies, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of her symptoms.",Success

His current medications are insulin and aspirin. Family history is significant for coronary artery disease. He has an 80 pack-year history of smoking and currently smokes. He consumes 4 drinks per day of alcohol. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 144/89 mm Hg, the heart rate is 80/min and regular, the breathing rate is 25/min, and the pulse oximetry is 96%. Normal cardiac and lung sounds were heard on auscultation. Which of the following is the appropriate treatment to improve the patient’s symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Cilostazol.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with intermittent claudication, a classic presentation of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The patient's history of smoking, diabetes, and coronary artery disease increases his risk for PAD.

Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that has been shown to improve symptoms of intermittent claudication by increasing walking distance and reducing pain. It is recommended as a first-line pharmacological treatment for PAD by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines.

Pentoxifylline (Option B) is another medication that has been used to treat intermittent claudication, but it is not as effective as cilostazol and is no longer recommended as a first-line treatment.

Femoral embolectomy (Option C) is a surgical procedure that is not indicated for intermittent claudication. It is typically used to treat acute limb ischemia, which is not present in this patient.

Femoral-to-popliteal bypass graft (Option D) is a surgical procedure that may be considered for patients with severe PAD who have not responded to other treatments. However, it is not the appropriate initial treatment for this patient.

Interventional endovascular treatment (Option E) may be considered for patients with PAD who have not responded to pharmacological treatment and lifestyle modifications. However, it is not the first-line treatment, and the patient should be tried on cilostazol and lifestyle modifications before considering interventional procedures.

In summary, cilostazol is the appropriate treatment to improve the patient's symptoms of intermittent claudication.",Success
"A 72-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of frequent headaches, double vision, fatigue, and myalgias. Physical examination shows pallor, tenderness to palpation over the temples, and inward deviation of the left eye. Laboratory studies show an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 65 mm/h. Temporal artery biopsy shows transmural granulomatous inflammation and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina. Treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids is begun. The patient's condition puts her at greatest risk of developing which of the following complications?",E,"The correct answer is D. Posterior uveitis.

The patient's symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with a diagnosis of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), also known as Temporal Arteritis. GCA is a type of vasculitis that affects the medium and large arteries, particularly the temporal arteries.

The patient's condition puts her at greatest risk of developing posterior uveitis, which is a complication of GCA. Posterior uveitis is an inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye, and can lead to vision loss if left untreated. GCA is a known cause of posterior uveitis, and prompt treatment with corticosteroids is essential to prevent this complication.

The other options are not directly related to GCA or its complications:

A. Pulmonary hypertension is a condition that affects the blood vessels in the lungs, and is not typically associated with GCA.

B. Lower extremity gangrene is a complication of peripheral artery disease, which is a separate condition from GCA.

C. Palpable purpura is a skin condition characterized by purple spots or patches, and is not typically associated with GCA.

E. Thoracic aortic aneurysm is a condition that affects the aorta, the main artery that arises from the heart, and is not a direct complication of GCA.

It's worth noting that GCA can also cause other complications, such as blindness, stroke, and aortic aneurysm, but posterior uveitis is a specific complication that is closely related to the eye symptoms the patient is experiencing.",Success
"A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician because of yellow vaginal discharge, pruritus, and pain with urination for the past 6 days. Three weeks ago, she had an episode of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis that was treated with a 10-day course of amoxicillin. She has been sexually active with multiple male partners over the past year and uses condoms inconsistently; she has been taking an oral contraceptive for the past 2 years. She has no previous history of serious illness or sexually transmitted diseases. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 75/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 122/82 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows erythema of the vulva and vagina and foul-smelling, frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge. The pH of the discharge is 5.8. Bimanual examination is unremarkable. Further evaluation of this patient's vaginal discharge is most likely to show which of the following findings?",E,"The correct answer is E. Flagellated protozoa.

The patient's symptoms, such as yellow vaginal discharge, pruritus, and pain with urination, are consistent with a vaginal infection. The pelvic examination findings, including erythema of the vulva and vagina, and foul-smelling, frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge, are also suggestive of a vaginal infection.

The pH of the discharge, 5.8, is higher than normal, which is consistent with a trichomonas infection. Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated protozoan that causes trichomoniasis, a common sexually transmitted infection (STI). The symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with trichomoniasis.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Obligate intracellular organisms are typically associated with chlamydial infections, which are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

B. Gram-negative diplococci are associated with gonococcal infections, which are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

C. A positive whiff test is associated with bacterial vaginosis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

D. Pseudohyphae are associated with candidal infections, which are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommend that women with symptoms of trichomoniasis, such as yellow-green vaginal discharge, pruritus, and pain with urination, be tested for trichomonas infection.",Success
"A 15-year-old female presents to her pediatrician’s office for severe menstrual cramping. The patient underwent menarche at age 11, and her periods were irregular every 2-3 months for two years. After that, her cycles became roughly regular every 28-35 days, but she has had extremely painful cramps and often has to miss school. The cramps are intermittent and feel like a dull ache in the center of her abdomen, and there is usually accompanying back pain. The patient has been using heating pads with limited relief. She reports some periods being “really heavy” and requires a superabsorbent pad every 6 hours for 2 days each cycle, but this does not limit her activities. She denies any bowel or bladder changes. The patient had normal development throughout childhood, is on the soccer team at school, and is not sexually active. Her father has hypertension and her mother has endometriosis and heavy periods. On exam, the patient is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 158 pounds (BMI 26.3 kg/m^2). She is well appearing and has no abdominal tenderness. She has Tanner IV breasts and Tanner IV pubic hair, and external genitalia are normal. Which of the following is the best next step for this patient’s menstrual cramps?",D,"The correct answer is D. NSAIDs.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with primary dysmenorrhea, which is a common condition characterized by painful menstrual cramps in the absence of any underlying pelvic pathology. The patient's history of irregular periods, heavy bleeding, and family history of endometriosis and heavy periods suggest that she may be at risk for underlying menstrual disorders, but the primary concern is her severe menstrual cramping.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends NSAIDs as the first-line treatment for primary dysmenorrhea. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, have been shown to be effective in reducing menstrual cramp pain and are generally well-tolerated.

The other options are not the best next step for this patient's menstrual cramps:

A. Von Willebrand factor antigen assay is not indicated for menstrual cramps, but rather for evaluating bleeding disorders.

B. Pelvic ultrasound may be useful in evaluating pelvic pathology, but it is not necessary at this point, given the patient's normal physical exam and lack of other symptoms.

C. MRI of the pelvis is not indicated for menstrual cramps and would not be a cost-effective or necessary step in this patient's evaluation.

E. Increased exercise may have some benefits for overall health, but it is not a specific treatment for menstrual cramps.

Before initiating NSAIDs, the healthcare provider should discuss the patient's medical history, including any allergies or sensitivities, and provide guidance on dosing and potential side effects. Additionally, the patient should be encouraged to continue using heating pads as an adjunctive therapy, as they may provide some relief.",Success
"A 34-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department following a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was the restrained driver. On arrival, she has a cervical collar in place and is unresponsive. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 131/76 mm Hg. Her pupils are dilated and not reactive to light. She is unresponsive to noxious stimuli. She is intubated, and mechanical ventilation is begun. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference range. Toxicology screening is negative. A CT scan of the head without contrast shows a massive intracranial bleed and a cervical spine injury at the level of C3. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death?",E,"The correct answer is E. Corneal reflex test.

Brain death is a clinical diagnosis that requires a thorough evaluation of the patient's neurological status. Given the patient's unresponsive state, dilated and non-reactive pupils, and lack of response to noxious stimuli, the next step in diagnosing brain death is to perform a series of clinical tests to assess brainstem function.

The corneal reflex test is a crucial component of the brain death examination. It involves gently touching the cornea with a cotton swab or a small brush to elicit a blink response. The absence of a blink response suggests brainstem dysfunction, which is a key criterion for brain death.

Electroencephalography (A) may be used as an ancillary test to support the diagnosis of brain death, but it is not a substitute for the clinical examination. Magnetic resonance angiography (B) is not relevant to the diagnosis of brain death. Deep tendon reflex testing (C) is not a reliable indicator of brain death, as some brain-dead patients may retain spinal cord reflexes. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (D) is not a standard test for diagnosing brain death.

According to the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) guidelines, the diagnosis of brain death requires a comprehensive clinical evaluation, including:

1. Coma or unresponsiveness
2. Absence of brainstem reflexes, including:
	* Pupillary response to light
	* Corneal reflex
	* Oculovestibular reflex (caloric testing)
	* Cough reflex
	* Gag reflex
3. Apnea, as demonstrated by an apnea test

The corneal reflex test is a critical component of this evaluation, and its absence supports the diagnosis of brain death.",Success
"A previously healthy 17-year-old female college student comes to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of fever, chills, and severe headache. Her temperature is 39.4°C (103°F). Physical examination shows nuchal rigidity and photophobia. Blood cultures are obtained and a lumbar puncture is performed. A Gram stain of cerebrospinal fluid shows gram-negative cocci in pairs. Which of the following virulence factors was most likely involved in the initial step of this patient's infection?",C,"The correct answer is C. Adhesive pili.

The patient's symptoms and the Gram stain result suggesting gram-negative cocci in pairs are consistent with Neisseria meningitidis, a common cause of meningitis in young adults. The initial step of N. meningitidis infection involves the adherence of the bacteria to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, which is facilitated by adhesive pili.

Adhesive pili are hair-like structures on the surface of N. meningitidis that allow the bacteria to adhere to epithelial cells, facilitating colonization and invasion. This is the initial step in the pathogenesis of meningococcal disease.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Protein A is a virulence factor associated with Staphylococcus aureus, not N. meningitidis.

B. Lipooligosaccharides are a component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, including N. meningitidis, but they are not directly involved in the initial step of infection.

D. Biofilm formation is a mechanism of bacterial persistence and resistance to antibiotics, but it is not directly involved in the initial step of N. meningitidis infection.

E. Polysaccharide capsule is an important virulence factor of N. meningitidis, but it is involved in the evasion of the host immune system and the development of meningitis, rather than the initial step of infection.

Current medical guidelines and evidence-based medicine support the role of adhesive pili in the initial step of N. meningitidis infection.",Success
"A 74-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care ward due to progressive dyspnea, cough with pink sputum, and diaphoresis. He had 2 myocardial infarctions at the age of 66 and 69 years and suffers from chronic heart failure. At the time of presentation, his vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate 108/min, respiratory rate 29/min, and temperature 35.5°C (95.9°F). On physical examination, the patient sits upright. He is lethargic and cyanotic. Lung auscultation reveals widespread bilateral fine rales. Cardiac examination is significant for S3, accentuation of the pulmonic component of S2, and a systolic murmur heard best at the apex of the heart. Soon after hospitalization, the patient develops ventricular fibrillation and dies despite adequate resuscitation measures. Which microscopic finding would you expect to see in this patient on autopsy?",A,"The correct answer is A. Brownish inclusions in the pulmonary macrophages on H&E staining.

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination, the likely diagnosis is cardiogenic pulmonary edema secondary to chronic heart failure. The patient's history of myocardial infarctions and chronic heart failure, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral fine rales, S3, and accentuation of the pulmonic component of S2, support this diagnosis.

The microscopic finding that would be expected in this patient on autopsy is the presence of brownish inclusions in the pulmonary macrophages on H&E staining, which is consistent with hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Hemosiderin is a pigment produced from the breakdown of hemoglobin, and its presence in macrophages indicates previous episodes of alveolar hemorrhage, which is a common finding in cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

B. Areas with 'ghost cells' surrounded by macrophages in the cardiac tissue are more consistent with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, which is not the primary diagnosis in this case.

C. Positive Prussian-blue staining of the kidney tissue would indicate iron deposition, which is not directly related to the patient's presenting symptoms.

D. Ground-glass hepatocytes are typically seen in hepatitis B infection, which is not relevant to this patient's presentation.

E. Positive Congo-red staining of the cardiac tissue would indicate amyloidosis, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings.

It's essential to note that the patient's death due to ventricular fibrillation is likely related to the underlying cardiac disease, but the microscopic finding expected on autopsy is more closely related to the patient's pulmonary symptoms and cardiogenic pulmonary edema.",Success

""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

The cardiologist wants to compare the changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up between the three groups (pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, and placebo). Since there are three groups being compared, and the outcome variables are continuous (plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores), ANOVA is the most appropriate statistical method.

ANOVA is a parametric test that compares the means of three or more groups to determine if there are significant differences between them. In this case, ANOVA would be used to compare the mean changes in each outcome variable between the three groups.

Pearson correlation analysis (A) is used to examine the relationship between two continuous variables, which is not the case here. The chi-square test (B) is used for categorical data, which is not applicable to this scenario. Meta-analysis (D) is a method used to combine the results of multiple studies, which is not relevant to this question. Kaplan-Meier analysis (E) is used for survival analysis, which is not applicable to this study design.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent episodes of heart palpitations for 3 weeks. The palpitations are accompanied by chest pain that is sharp and localized to the left 3rd intercostal space. The patient does not smoke. She drinks one to two glasses of wine on the weekends. She appears nervous. Her pulse is 110/min and irregularly irregular, and blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg. Examination shows a fine tremor on both hands and digital swelling. There is retraction of the left upper eyelid. A systolic ejection murmur is heard along the right upper sternal border. The extremities are warm, and pulses are 2+ bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",A,"The correct answer is A. Propranolol.

The patient's symptoms, physical examination, and vital signs suggest a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, specifically Graves' disease. The symptoms include:

* Intermittent heart palpitations, which are common in hyperthyroidism
* Chest pain, which can be caused by increased heart rate and cardiac output
* Nervousness, tremors, and digital swelling, which are characteristic of hyperthyroidism
* Retraction of the left upper eyelid, which is a sign of Graves' ophthalmopathy
* Systolic ejection murmur, which can be caused by increased cardiac output

Propranolol is a beta-blocker that is commonly used to treat the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, particularly the cardiac manifestations. It can help to:

* Reduce heart rate and palpitations
* Decrease cardiac output and alleviate chest pain
* Relieve tremors and anxiety
* Reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation, which is common in hyperthyroidism

The other options are not as appropriate for this patient:

* Digoxin (B) is a cardiac glycoside that is used to treat atrial fibrillation, but it is not a first-line treatment for hyperthyroidism.
* Amiodarone (C) is an antiarrhythmic medication that can be used to treat atrial fibrillation, but it has a high risk of side effects and is not typically used as a first-line treatment for hyperthyroidism.
* Warfarin (D) is an anticoagulant that is used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, but it is not a treatment for hyperthyroidism.
* Diltiazem (E) is a calcium channel blocker that is used to treat hypertension and angina, but it is not typically used to treat hyperthyroidism.

It's worth noting that the patient will likely require further evaluation and treatment for her hyperthyroidism, including thyroid function tests, imaging studies, and potentially radioactive iodine therapy or surgery. However, propranolol can be used as a bridge therapy to alleviate symptoms while awaiting definitive treatment.",Success
A 78-year-old right-handed man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for sudden onset speech changes. The patient lives with his daughter and was chatting with her when suddenly his speech became distorted with random and disconnected words that made no sense. He seems to be physically frustrated that no one understands him. Physical examination demonstrates weakness of the right arm. Damage to which location would best explain this patient’s symptoms?,A,"The correct answer is A. Left frontal lobe.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms suggest a sudden onset of expressive aphasia, characterized by distorted speech with random and disconnected words that make no sense. This is often seen in Broca's aphasia, which is typically caused by damage to the left frontal lobe, specifically Broca's area (Brodmann areas 44 and 45).

The patient's physical examination also reveals weakness of the right arm, which is consistent with a left hemispheric lesion. The left hemisphere is responsible for language processing and motor control of the right side of the body.

The left frontal lobe is responsible for expressive language, including speech production, articulation, and fluency. Damage to this area can result in Broca's aphasia, characterized by difficulty speaking in grammatically correct sentences, struggling to find the right words, and speaking in short, fragmented sentences.

The other options are not as likely to explain the patient's symptoms:

B. Left internal capsule: This structure is involved in motor control and sensation, but it is not typically associated with language processing or aphasia.

C. Left temporal lobe: This area is involved in receptive language, including comprehension and interpretation of spoken language. Damage to this area can result in Wernicke's aphasia, characterized by difficulty understanding spoken language and speaking in complete but often nonsensical sentences.

D. Right frontal lobe: This area is involved in motor control and attention, but it is not typically associated with language processing or aphasia.

E. Right temporal lobe: This area is involved in auditory processing and memory, but it is not typically associated with language processing or aphasia.

In summary, the patient's symptoms of expressive aphasia and right arm weakness are best explained by damage to the left frontal lobe, specifically Broca's area.",Success
"A 68-year-old woman presents with an intermittent throbbing headache with an onset approximately 3 weeks ago. The pain is bilateral, “band-like,” and extends to the neck. The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). The physical examination reveals S2 accentuation that is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border. Palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless. The neurologic exam shows no focal symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism underlying the patient’s headaches?",E,"The correct answer is E. Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of postural orthostatic headache syndrome (POHS), which is a type of headache caused by dilation of intracerebral arterioles. The key features that support this diagnosis are:

1. Bilateral, band-like headache that worsens with coughing or laughing, which suggests an increase in intracranial pressure.
2. The headache is worse in the morning, which is consistent with the natural diurnal variation in blood pressure.
3. The patient's medications, particularly lisinopril, can cause orthostatic hypotension, which may contribute to the development of POHS.
4. The absence of nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia, which are typical features of migraines, suggests that the headache is not migrainous in nature.
5. The patient's physical examination reveals S2 accentuation, which is consistent with hypertension, but there is no evidence of meningeal symptoms or focal neurological deficits.

The other options are less likely:

A. Meningeal irritation by blood products originating from a chronic subdural hematoma is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a subdural hematoma, and there is no evidence of meningeal symptoms or focal neurological deficits.

B. Dissection of an intracerebral vessel is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a vascular dissection, and there is no evidence of focal neurological deficits.

C. Pressure created by the content of the paranasal sinuses is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a sinus headache, and palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless.

D. Meningeal irritation by a growing intracranial neoplasm is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a neoplasm, and there is no evidence of meningeal symptoms or focal neurological deficits.

Therefore, the most likely mechanism underlying the patient's headaches is dilation of the intracerebral arterioles, consistent with a diagnosis of postural orthostatic headache syndrome.",Success
"A 31-year-old male comes to your office for his annual exam.

In addition to an influenza vaccine, which vaccine should be administered to this patient during this visit?",C,"The correct answer is C. Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis booster (Tdap) vaccine.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), adults who have not received a tetanus and diphtheria (Td) booster in the past 10 years should receive a Tdap booster. This is because immunity to pertussis (whooping cough) wanes over time, and adults can transmit pertussis to infants and young children who are at highest risk for severe disease.

In this scenario, the patient has not had any vaccines in the past 13 years, making him a candidate for a Tdap booster. The other options are not indicated for this patient:

A. Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for adults 65 years and older, or for those with certain underlying medical conditions, such as chronic heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes. This patient does not meet these criteria.

B. Meningococcal vaccine is recommended for certain high-risk groups, such as college freshmen living in dormitories, military recruits, and individuals with certain medical conditions. This patient does not meet these criteria.

D. Haemophilus influenza B (HIB) vaccine is primarily recommended for children under 5 years old, and is not typically given to adults.

E. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for males up to age 21, and for males 22-26 years old who are immunocompromised or have not completed the series. While this patient is sexually active, he is above the recommended age range for HPV vaccination.

"A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 2-week history of a foot ulcer. She says that she punctured her foot with a rusty nail while she was playing tennis and that the puncture wound has since progressed to a non-healing ulcer. Over the last 2 days, she has also been experiencing a fever and drainage from the wound. On presentation, she is found to have a slightly fruity smelling red ulcer with purulent drainage. Probing the ulcer goes all the way down to bone. Which of the following characteristics is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is C. Gram-positive bacilli.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the fruity smelling red ulcer with purulent drainage, suggest a diagnosis of clostridial infection, likely Clostridium perfringens. This bacterium is a gram-positive bacillus that can cause severe soft tissue infections, including gas gangrene.

The rusty nail puncture wound is a classic risk factor for clostridial infection, as the bacteria are commonly found in soil and can be introduced into the wound through contaminated objects. The patient's fever, drainage, and bone involvement (as evidenced by probing the ulcer down to bone) are all consistent with a severe soft tissue infection.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms:

A. Gram-negative bacilli: This would be more consistent with infections such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which typically cause a blue-green pigment and a grape-like odor.

B. Gram-negative diplococci: This would be more consistent with infections such as Neisseria meningitidis, which typically cause meningitis and sepsis.

D. Gram-positive cocci in chains: This would be more consistent with infections such as Streptococcus pyogenes, which typically cause pharyngitis and skin infections.

E. Gram-positive cocci in clusters: This would be more consistent with infections such as Staphylococcus aureus, which typically cause skin and soft tissue infections, but not typically gas gangrene.

It's worth noting that a definitive diagnosis would require further testing, including wound cultures and imaging studies. However, based on the patient's symptoms and risk factors, clostridial infection is a strong possibility, and gram-positive bacilli are the most likely cause.",Success

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest an acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. In this context, the question is asking about the molecular event that induces the expression of more MHC class I molecules on infected cells.

Interferon (IFN) is a key cytokine involved in the immune response to viral infections, including HAV. One of the effects of IFN is to induce the expression of MHC class I molecules on infected cells, which helps to present viral antigens to CD8+ T cells and trigger an immune response.

Interferon also activates the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which is a key step in the regulation of protein synthesis. This activation leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis, which can help to limit viral replication.

The other options are not directly related to the induction of MHC class I molecules on infected cells:

A. Upregulated expression of exogenously synthesized antigens is related to MHC class II molecules, not MHC class I.

B. Enhanced macrophage phagocytic function is an effect of IFN, but it's not directly related to MHC class I expression.

C. Differentiation of T cells into TH1 cells is an effect of IFN, but it's not directly related to MHC class I expression.

E. Increased breakdown of intracellular RNA is not a direct effect of IFN on MHC class I expression.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Activation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2.",Success
A 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressive fatigue and shortness of breath for 1 month. He has been unable to practice with his recreational soccer team and has had to rest frequently when walking to work. His only medication is ibuprofen for joint pain. Physical examination shows tanned skin. There is tenderness to palpation and stiffness of the metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands. Pulmonary examination shows coarse crackles in both lung fields. The liver is palpated 4 cm below the right costal margin. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing is most likely to be positive for which of the following?,E,"The correct answer is D. HLA-B8.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with hemochromatosis, a genetic disorder characterized by excessive iron absorption and deposition in various organs. The presence of fatigue, shortness of breath, tanned skin, joint pain, and hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) are all indicative of hemochromatosis.

HLA-B8 is strongly associated with hemochromatosis, particularly in people of Northern European descent. In fact, approximately 90% of individuals with hemochromatosis are HLA-B8 positive.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. HLA-B27 is associated with ankylosing spondylitis and other seronegative spondyloarthropathies, which do not match the patient's symptoms.

B. HLA-DR3 is associated with autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis, but not hemochromatosis.

C. HLA-DR4 is associated with rheumatoid arthritis, but not hemochromatosis.

E. HLA-A3 is not specifically associated with hemochromatosis or any of the patient's symptoms.

It's essential to note that while HLA-B8 is a strong indicator of hemochromatosis, it is not a definitive diagnostic test. Further evaluation, including iron studies and genetic testing, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",Success
"A 32-year-old Caucasian woman is referred to a gastroenterologist by her family physician for 8 months of abdominal pain, foul-smelling diarrhea with floating, bulky stools, weight loss, and macrocytic anemia. Her personal history is relevant for allergic rhinitis. Physical examination shows grouped, erythematous papulovesicular lesions on her arms, torso, and abdomen. Which of the following is the most appropriate approach for the management of this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Gluten-free diet.

The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, foul-smelling diarrhea with floating, bulky stools, weight loss, and macrocytic anemia, are consistent with malabsorption and steatorrhea, which are classic features of celiac disease. The presence of grouped, erythematous papulovesicular lesions on her arms, torso, and abdomen, known as dermatitis herpetiformis, is a skin manifestation of celiac disease.

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a permanent intolerance to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The only effective treatment for celiac disease is a strict, lifelong gluten-free diet. This diet will help to alleviate symptoms, improve nutrient absorption, and prevent long-term complications such as osteoporosis, anemia, and increased risk of certain cancers.

Amitriptyline (Option A) is a tricyclic antidepressant that may be used to treat irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but it is not indicated for celiac disease.

Octreotide (Option B) is a somatostatin analog that may be used to treat certain gastrointestinal disorders, such as carcinoid syndrome or VIPoma, but it is not indicated for celiac disease.

A lactose-free diet (Option C) may be beneficial for patients with lactose intolerance, but it is not a treatment for celiac disease.

Methysergide maleate (Option E) is a serotonin receptor antagonist that was previously used to treat migraines, but it is no longer available in the US market due to its association with retroperitoneal fibrosis.

Therefore, the most appropriate approach for the management of this patient is a gluten-free diet (Option D).",Success
"A 62-year-old woman with small-cell lung cancer comes to the physician because of a painful, burning red rash on her face and hands that developed 30 minutes after going outside to do garden work. She wore a long-sleeved shirt and was exposed to direct sunlight for about 10 minutes. The patient is light-skinned and has a history of occasional sunburns when she does not apply sunscreen. Current medications include demeclocycline for malignancy-associated hyponatremia and amoxicillin for sinusitis. Physical examination shows prominent erythema and a papular eruption on her forehead, cheeks, neck, and the dorsum of both hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is E. Cell injury due to drug metabolites.

The patient's symptoms, including a painful, burning red rash on her face and hands, are consistent with a phototoxic reaction. This type of reaction occurs when a medication or its metabolites accumulate in the skin and react with ultraviolet (UV) light, causing cell injury and inflammation.

Demeclocycline, one of the patient's medications, is a tetracycline antibiotic known to cause phototoxicity. When demeclocycline is exposed to UV light, it can form reactive metabolites that damage skin cells, leading to the symptoms described.

Option A is incorrect because degranulation of presensitized mast cells is more characteristic of an allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis.

Option B is incorrect because formation of drug-induced autoantibodies is more related to autoimmune disorders, not phototoxic reactions.

Option C is incorrect because lymphocyte-mediated allergic reactions typically occur over a longer period and are not directly related to UV light exposure.

Option D is incorrect because accumulation of porphobilinogen is related to porphyrias, a group of disorders characterized by abnormalities in heme biosynthesis, which is not related to the patient's symptoms.

It's essential to note that phototoxic reactions are often dose-independent and can occur at therapeutic doses of the medication, as seen in this case.",Success
"A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he was found outside in the middle of a blizzard. On presentation, he is conscious but does not know where he is nor how he got there. His wife is contacted and says that he has been getting increasingly confused over the past 6 weeks. This progressed from misplacing objects to getting lost in places that he knew how to navigate previously. Most worryingly, he has recently started forgetting the names of their children. In addition to these memory changes, she says that he now has rapid jerky movements of his extremities as well as coordination and balance problems. Finally, he has become extremely paranoid about government surveillance and has had hallucinations about secret agents in their house. His previous medical history is significant for a previous car crash in which the patient required internal fixation of a femur fracture and a corneal transplant for corneal degeneration. Otherwise he had no neurologic deficits prior to 6 weeks ago. Physical exam reveals myoclonus and ataxia. Which of the following is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Can be transmitted on medical equipment even after autoclaving instruments.

Based on the patient's symptoms, including rapid cognitive decline, memory loss, myoclonus, ataxia, and hallucinations, the most likely diagnosis is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). CJD is a rare, degenerative, and fatal brain disorder caused by an abnormal form of a protein called a prion.

Prions are infectious proteins that can cause normal proteins to fold abnormally, leading to cell death and tissue damage. They are highly resistant to inactivation and can survive on medical equipment, even after autoclaving, which is a process that uses high-pressure steam to sterilize instruments. This is why option A is correct.

Option B is incorrect because prions do not contain genetic material. They are infectious proteins that can cause disease without the presence of DNA or RNA.

Option C is incorrect because prions do not have a cell wall containing peptidoglycan. Peptidoglycan is a component of bacterial cell walls, not prions.

Option D is incorrect because CJD is not associated with longstanding hypertension.

Option E is incorrect because CJD is characterized by the accumulation of abnormally folded prion protein, not hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Tau protein is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.

The patient's history of a corneal transplant is a significant risk factor for iatrogenic CJD, which is transmission of the disease through medical procedures, such as organ transplantation or contaminated medical equipment.",Success
"A 5-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician due to sore throat and fever. He was in his usual state of health until 3 days ago when he began to complain of a sore throat as well as general malaise. The patient's past medical history reveals recurrent upper respiratory infections but no skin or soft tissue infections. The child had cardiac surgery as an infant but has otherwise been healthy. On presentation, his temperature is 100°F (37.8 °C), blood pressure is 115/72 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 22/min. Physical exam shows white plaques on the tongue and mouth. A scraping of this material reveals a characteristic morphology after being treated with KOH. Serum protein electrophoresis shows a normal distribution of bands from this patient. Which of the following findings would most likely be found in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Hypoparathyroidism.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with oral candidiasis, which is a fungal infection that can cause white plaques on the tongue and mouth. The characteristic morphology of the scraping treated with KOH (potassium hydroxide) further supports this diagnosis.

Given the patient's history of recurrent upper respiratory infections and cardiac surgery as an infant, it is likely that the patient has a primary immunodeficiency disorder. The normal serum protein electrophoresis rules out a diagnosis of hyper-IgE syndrome, which is often associated with recurrent infections and skin manifestations.

Among the options, hypoparathyroidism is a common finding in patients with DiGeorge syndrome, a primary immunodeficiency disorder that can present with recurrent infections, cardiac defects, and oral candidiasis. DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a deletion of chromosome 22q11.2, which can lead to abnormalities in the development of the thymus, parathyroid glands, and heart.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and medical history:

A. Abnormal expression of autoimmune regulator (AIRE) is associated with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1), which is a rare genetic disorder that can cause a variety of autoimmune manifestations, but is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

B. Delayed separation of the umbilical cord is a characteristic finding in patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD), which is a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system, but is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

D. Partial albinism is a characteristic finding in patients with Griscelli syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system and skin pigmentation, but is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

E. Thrombocytopenic purpura is a bleeding disorder that is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and medical history.

Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient is hypoparathyroidism, which is a common feature of DiGeorge syndrome.",Success
A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for sleeping problems and the inability to concentrate for 3 months. She says she is worried because she and her husband have been trying to conceive for more than a year with no success. Conception by in vitro fertilization was attempted once 3 months ago but was unsuccessful. Analysis of her husband's semen has shown normal sperm counts and morphology. She has a 6-year-old daughter who was born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. She has no history of severe illness and tries to stay healthy by going to the gym an hour per day. Her menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 to 6 days; her last menstrual period started 2 days ago. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's inability to conceive?,C,"The correct answer is C. Diminished ovarian reserve.

Here's why:

The patient's history suggests that she is ovulating regularly, as evidenced by her regular 28-day menstrual cycles. The fact that she has a 6-year-old daughter also indicates that she has been fertile in the past. The normal sperm count and morphology of her husband's semen rule out male factor infertility.

Given the patient's age (35) and her history of failed in vitro fertilization (IVF) attempt, diminished ovarian reserve is a likely cause of her infertility. Diminished ovarian reserve refers to a decrease in the number and quality of eggs in the ovaries, which can make it more difficult to conceive. This condition is more common in women over 35 years old.

The other options are less likely:

A. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is unlikely given the patient's regular menstrual cycles and lack of symptoms or history of severe illness.

B. Asherman's syndrome is a condition characterized by adhesions or scarring in the uterus, which can cause infertility. However, the patient's history of a previous successful pregnancy and lack of symptoms or abnormal physical examination findings make this diagnosis less likely.

D. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a condition characterized by low levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which can cause infertility. However, the patient's regular menstrual cycles and lack of symptoms or abnormal physical examination findings make this diagnosis less likely.

E. Premature ovarian failure is a condition characterized by the cessation of ovarian function before the age of 40. While the patient is experiencing infertility, her regular menstrual cycles and lack of symptoms or abnormal physical examination findings make this diagnosis less likely.

In conclusion, based on the patient's age, history of failed IVF, and regular menstrual cycles, diminished ovarian reserve is the most likely cause of her infertility.",Success
"A 25-year-old female is brought to the emergency department by her family. They found her somnolent next to her computer and scattered pill bottles over two hours ago. The family cannot recall the types of pill bottles that they found and did not bring them to the ED. The patient's past medical history is notable for anxiety, obesity, hypertension, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. She is currently not on any medications other than an exercise program with which she is non-compliant. A physical exam is performed and is within normal limits. The patient begins communicating with the physician and states that she did take acetaminophen but it was only a few pills. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse is 82/min, blood pressure is 125/85 mmHg, respirations are 11/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",A,"The correct answer is B. Blood acetaminophen levels.

Here's why:

The patient has a suspected acetaminophen overdose, and the next step is to determine the severity of the overdose. Acetaminophen levels should be drawn 4 hours or more after ingestion to determine the risk of liver damage. This is because peak acetaminophen levels are typically reached within 4 hours of ingestion.

Option A, N-acetylcysteine, is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose, but it's not the next best step. N-acetylcysteine is typically administered if the acetaminophen level is above the treatment line on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, which is a graph used to determine the risk of liver damage based on the acetaminophen level and time of ingestion.

Option C, charcoal, may be considered if the patient presents within 1-2 hours of ingestion, but it's not the next best step in this scenario. The patient's family found her 2 hours ago, and it's unclear when she ingested the pills, so charcoal is unlikely to be effective.

Option D, IV fluids, is not specifically indicated for acetaminophen overdose, although the patient may receive fluids as part of supportive care.

Option E, syrup of ipecac, is not recommended for acetaminophen overdose. Ipecac is a gastrointestinal decontaminant that can cause vomiting, but it's not effective in removing acetaminophen from the stomach and intestines, and it can also cause complications such as aspiration pneumonia.

The American Academy of Clinical Toxicology and the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists recommend drawing acetaminophen levels 4 hours or more after ingestion to guide management.",Success
A 27-year-old man and his wife come to the physician for preconception genetic counseling. The patient and his wife are asymptomatic and have no history of serious illness. The patient's older brother died at age 13 from heart failure and his 6-year-old nephew currently has severe muscle weakness. Genetic testing in the patient's family shows that his mother is not a carrier of the mutation that is responsible for the disease in his relatives. A pedigree chart of the patient's family is shown. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the patient not being affected?,C,"The correct answer is E. Incomplete penetrance.

Let's break down the information provided:

* The patient's older brother died at age 13 from heart failure, and his 6-year-old nephew currently has severe muscle weakness, indicating a genetic disorder that affects the heart and muscles.
* Genetic testing shows that the patient's mother is not a carrier of the mutation responsible for the disease in his relatives. This suggests that the mutation is likely to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, as the patient's mother is not a carrier, but the disease is still present in the family.
* The patient is asymptomatic, which means he does not exhibit any signs or symptoms of the disease.

Given this information, the most likely explanation for the patient not being affected is incomplete penetrance. Incomplete penetrance refers to a situation where a person inherits a dominant mutation but does not express the associated phenotype or symptoms. This means that the patient has inherited the mutation, but it is not manifesting clinically.

The other options can be ruled out as follows:

A. Variable expressivity refers to the variation in severity or expression of a disease among individuals who inherit the same mutation. While this could be a possibility, it doesn't explain why the patient is completely asymptomatic.

B. Maternal uniparental disomy is a rare genetic condition where a person inherits two copies of a chromosome from one parent and no copies from the other parent. This is not relevant to the scenario described.

C. Gonadal mosaicism refers to a situation where a person's reproductive cells (gametes) contain a mixture of normal and mutated cells. This could lead to the transmission of a mutation to offspring, but it doesn't explain why the patient himself is not affected.

D. Dominant negative mutation is a type of mutation that can lead to a dominant negative effect, where the mutated protein interferes with the normal function of the wild-type protein. While this could be a possibility, it doesn't explain why the patient is asymptomatic.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient not being affected is incomplete penetrance.",Success
"A 58-year-old Caucasian female presents to her primary care physician with concerns about several recent health changes. The patient has recently gained weight and can't seem to exercise like she used to. She also notes that her thinking seems slow. Physical examination shows thickened, dry skin. Serum analysis confirms the physician's suspicions. Which of the following findings was most helpful in the diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. High TSH.

The patient's symptoms, such as weight gain, fatigue, and decreased exercise tolerance, are consistent with hypothyroidism. The physical examination finding of thickened, dry skin also supports this diagnosis. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, leading to a range of symptoms.

The diagnosis of hypothyroidism is typically confirmed by laboratory tests, including measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels. In hypothyroidism, TSH levels are typically elevated, while FT4 levels are low.

Option C, high TSH, is the most helpful finding in diagnosing hypothyroidism. Elevated TSH levels indicate that the pituitary gland is trying to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones, but the thyroid gland is not responding adequately.

Option A, high T4 and T3, would be more consistent with hyperthyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone.

Option B, low T4 and T3, could be seen in hypothyroidism, but it would not be as specific or diagnostic as an elevated TSH level.

Option D, hypercholesterolemia, is a separate condition characterized by high cholesterol levels and is not directly related to thyroid function.

Option E, low TSH, would be more consistent with hyperthyroidism or thyroid hormone suppression, rather than hypothyroidism.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American Thyroid Association, recommend measuring TSH levels as the initial test for diagnosing hypothyroidism.",Success
"A 33-year-old woman at 17-weeks gestation comes to the physician for evaluation of a painless mass in the right breast for the last 3 weeks that has not increased in size. Physical examination shows dense breasts and a 2.5-cm rubbery, mobile mass that is nontender in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. A biopsy of the mass shows rounded contour with overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissue. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Fibroadenoma.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a fibroadenoma:

* Painless mass in the breast that has not increased in size
* Dense breasts
* 2.5-cm rubbery, mobile mass that is nontender in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast

The biopsy results also support this diagnosis:

* Rounded contour with overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissue

Fibroadenomas are benign breast tumors that are common in women of childbearing age. They are typically round, mobile, and rubbery to the touch, and are often found in the upper outer quadrant of the breast. The biopsy results showing a rounded contour with overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissue are consistent with a fibroadenoma.

The other options can be ruled out:

* B. Normal pregnancy-related changes: While pregnancy can cause breast changes, the presence of a distinct mass is not a typical finding.
* C. Fibrocystic changes of the breast: Fibrocystic changes are a common benign condition characterized by breast tenderness, swelling, and lumpiness. However, the biopsy results do not support this diagnosis.
* D. Fat necrosis: Fat necrosis is a condition that occurs when fatty tissue in the breast dies, often as a result of trauma. It typically presents as a painful, firm mass, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.
* E. Phyllodes tumor: Phyllodes tumors are rare breast tumors that can be benign or malignant. They are typically larger than fibroadenomas and have a more irregular shape. The biopsy results do not support this diagnosis.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Cancer Society, recommend that breast masses in pregnant women be evaluated and managed similarly to those in non-pregnant women. Biopsy is often necessary to determine the diagnosis, and fibroadenoma is a common diagnosis in women of childbearing age.",Success
"A 27-year-old male presents for emergency surgery to reattach his left arm, severed during a high-speed car accident, and has lost significant amounts of blood. His wife arrives within minutes to the hospital exclaiming that under no circumstance should he receive any blood transfusions during surgery. After reviewing his medical chart, you see also see an annotation indicating no blood transfusions for religious reasons. Knowing that he needs a blood transfusion to save his life, what do you do?",C,"The correct answer is C. Respect the patient's written instructions and do not administer a blood transfusion.

As a medical assistant, it is essential to respect the patient's autonomy and adhere to their advance directive, even if it goes against medical advice. In this scenario, the patient has explicitly stated in their medical chart that they do not want to receive blood transfusions for religious reasons. This is a legally binding document that must be respected.

While it is true that the patient's life is at risk without the blood transfusion, it is crucial to prioritize the patient's autonomy and respect their decision. The healthcare team must work together to explore alternative treatment options that align with the patient's wishes, even if they are not the preferred medical course of action.

It is not appropriate to administer a blood transfusion against the patient's explicit wishes (Option A), as this would be a violation of their autonomy and potentially lead to legal consequences. Similarly, it is not the role of the healthcare team to convince the wife to override the patient's decision (Option D).

Calling the ethics board (Option B) may be a reasonable step to take in this situation, but it would not change the fact that the patient's autonomy must be respected. Refusing to treat the patient (Option E) is not an acceptable option, as it is the healthcare team's duty to provide care and explore alternative treatment options that align with the patient's wishes.

In summary, respecting the patient's written instructions and not administering a blood transfusion is the most appropriate course of action in this scenario.",Success
The parents of a 14-year-old patient are concerned and have questions about the use of insulin for their son’s recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes. The patient has developed an upper respiratory infection while at school. He is coughing and has a runny nose. His temperature is 37.8° C (100.2° F) and vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following modifications to his insulin regimen would you recommend to this patient and his parents?,A,"The correct answer is A. Increase the frequency of blood glucose checks.

When a patient with type 1 diabetes develops an illness, such as an upper respiratory infection, it's essential to closely monitor their blood glucose levels. This is because illness can cause blood glucose levels to fluctuate, and insulin requirements may change.

In this scenario, the patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and the physical examination is unremarkable, indicating that the infection is mild. However, it's still important to increase the frequency of blood glucose checks to ensure that the patient's blood glucose levels remain within a safe range.

Reducing the insulin dose (option B) or holding insulin (option D) is not recommended, as this could lead to hyperglycemia and potentially worsen the patient's condition. Increasing the insulin dose to double (option E) is also not justified, as there is no indication that the patient's insulin requirements have increased.

Continuing the same insulin regimen (option C) without increasing the frequency of blood glucose checks may not be sufficient, as the patient's insulin needs may change during the illness.

The American Diabetes Association recommends that patients with type 1 diabetes check their blood glucose levels more frequently during illness, such as every 2-3 hours, to ensure that their levels remain within a safe range. This allows for timely adjustments to insulin doses and prevents complications.",Success
"A researcher evaluates healthy breast tissue from 100 women, 50 women that were pregnant at the time of the study and 50 age-matched non-pregnant women. The breast tissue in pregnant women contained an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation compared to the non-pregnant women. Which process caused this change?",A,"The correct answer is A. Hyperplasia.

Hyperplasia is a process of cellular proliferation, where there is an increase in the number of cells in a tissue or organ. In this scenario, the breast tissue from pregnant women showed an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation, which is a characteristic of hyperplasia. This is a normal physiological response to hormonal changes during pregnancy, where the breast tissue prepares for lactation.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

B. Hypertrophy refers to an increase in the size of individual cells, not an increase in the number of cells. While hypertrophy can occur in response to hormonal changes, it is not the primary process responsible for the observed changes in this scenario.

C. Atrophy refers to a decrease in the size or number of cells, which is the opposite of what is observed in this scenario.

D. Metaplasia is a process where one type of differentiated cell is replaced by another type of differentiated cell. This is not relevant to the observed changes in this scenario, where the breast tissue is showing an increase in the number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation.

E. Dysplasia refers to abnormal cell growth or development, which is not a normal physiological response to pregnancy. Dysplasia can be a precursor to cancer, but it is not the correct answer in this scenario.

It's worth noting that hyperplasia can be a normal physiological response, as seen in this scenario, or it can be a pathological response, such as in the case of endometrial hyperplasia, which can increase the risk of endometrial cancer.",Success
A 21-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. His mother noticed deformities in both of his legs since he started walking independently.

He can kick a ball and say a 2-word phrase. He plays well with other children at his day care. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 40th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows closed anterior and posterior fontanelles. The knees do not stay together when both the feet and ankles are placed together. The gait is unremarkable. The mother is concerned that he has a growth disorder. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,B,"The correct answer is B. Reassurance and follow-up.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with physiologic genu varum, also known as bowed legs, which is a common and normal variation in toddlers. The knees not staying together when both feet and ankles are placed together is a characteristic finding. The fact that the gait is unremarkable and the child can kick a ball suggests that the deformity is not causing any functional impairment.

Physiologic genu varum typically resolves on its own by 2-3 years of age, and reassurance and follow-up are the most appropriate next steps. There is no indication for vitamin D supplementation, X-ray of the lower extremities, bracing, or tibial osteotomy at this time.

It's worth noting that the family history of developmental dysplasia of the hip in the patient's sister is not relevant to this presentation, as it is a different condition.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends monitoring for genu varum and genu valgum (knock-knees) in toddlers, with reassurance and follow-up being the primary management strategy. Interventions such as bracing or surgery are typically reserved for more severe cases that do not resolve on their own or are causing functional impairment.",Success

The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. No further intervention.

The patient presents with a small, firm, non-tender, immobile cystic mass at the edge of the exocervical os with a yellow hue. Based on the description, it is likely a Nabothian cyst, which is a benign mucinous retention cyst of the cervix. Nabothian cysts are common and usually asymptomatic. They are caused by the obstruction of mucous glands in the cervix, leading to the accumulation of mucus.

Given the patient's asymptomatic presentation, normal Pap smears, and lack of other complaints, no further intervention is necessary. Nabothian cysts do not require treatment and may resolve spontaneously.

The other options are not justified:

B. Electrocautery and cryofreezing are not indicated for a benign Nabothian cyst.

C. Colposcopy and biopsy are not necessary, as the patient has no abnormal Pap smears or other suspicious symptoms.

D. Administration of oral contraceptives is not relevant to the management of a Nabothian cyst.

The patient's physical examination findings, including the prominent posterior part of the head, low-set ears, small and retracted jaw, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and convex deformity of the plantar surface of the foot, are consistent with a diagnosis of Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). The presence of an omphalocele, a congenital abdominal wall defect, further supports this diagnosis.

Trisomy 13 is a chromosomal disorder characterized by a range of congenital anomalies, including cardiac defects, which occur in approximately 80% of cases. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a common cardiac defect associated with Trisomy 13.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's physical examination findings and are less likely to be associated with Trisomy 13:

A. Cataracts are more commonly associated with Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome).

C. Ebstein's anomaly is a congenital heart defect that can occur in isolation or as part of a syndrome, but it is not typically associated with Trisomy 13.

D. Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that is not typically associated with Trisomy 13.

E. Holoprosencephaly is a rare congenital brain defect that can occur in isolation or as part of a syndrome, but it is not typically associated with Trisomy 13.

It's essential to note that Trisomy 13 is a complex condition that requires a comprehensive evaluation, including genetic testing, to confirm the diagnosis.",Success
"A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of fatigue, weight loss, and intermittent fevers for the past 6 months. He has had sexual intercourse with multiple men and women over the past year and does not use barrier protection. His last screen for sexually transmitted diseases was 10 years ago and was normal. His past medical history is notable for well-controlled asthma. He was involved in a motorcycle accident 2 years ago and suffered multiple fractured bones in his upper and lower extremities, all of which have healed. He has a distant history of cocaine abuse. He drinks 5-6 glasses of wine per week. His temperature is 100.8°F (38.2°C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, he appears cachectic but is pleasant and appropriately interactive. An HIV differentiation assay and follow-up Western blot are performed and are positive. The patient is started on tenofovir, abacavir, and efavirenz. However, the patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, so the decision is made to replace this medication with ritonavir. Which of the following adverse effects is this patient at greatest risk for as a result of this change in medication regimen?",B,"The correct answer is A. Hepatotoxicity.

Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, which is involved in the metabolism of many drugs, including efavirenz. When ritonavir is added to the regimen, it can increase the levels of efavirenz, leading to increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Efavirenz is already known to cause liver enzyme elevations, and the addition of ritonavir can potentiate this effect.

Abacavir, which was replaced by ritonavir, is not typically associated with hepatotoxicity. The other options are not directly related to the interaction between ritonavir and efavirenz:

* Lipodystrophy (B) is a side effect of antiretroviral therapy, particularly protease inhibitors, but it is not specifically related to the addition of ritonavir.
* Megaloblastic anemia (C) is not a known side effect of ritonavir or efavirenz.
* Myelosuppression (D) is not a typical side effect of ritonavir or efavirenz.
* Peripheral neuropathy (E) is not directly related to the interaction between ritonavir and efavirenz.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the International Antiviral Society-USA (IAS-USA), recommend careful monitoring of liver enzymes when combining ritonavir with efavirenz, due to the increased risk of hepatotoxicity.",Success

Urinalysis shows proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells. The patient’s proteinuria best fits in which of the following category?",A,"Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the correct answer is A. Overflow proteinuria.

Here's why:

* The patient's urinalysis shows proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells, indicating that the proteinuria is not due to glomerular damage or inflammation.
* The patient's laboratory results show a significantly elevated creatinine level (2.7 mg/dL), indicating kidney damage or chronic kidney disease.
* The patient's anemia (Hb 9.8 g/dL) and elevated urea nitrogen level (31 mg/dL) also support the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease.
* Overflow proteinuria occurs when there is an excess production of proteins in the blood, which then spills over into the urine. This is often seen in conditions such as multiple myeloma, where there is an overproduction of abnormal proteins.
* In this case, the patient's elevated calcium level (12.1 mg/dL) and anemia suggest the possibility of multiple myeloma, which would cause overflow proteinuria.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

* B. Transient (functional) proteinuria is a benign condition that occurs in response to a variety of factors, such as fever, exercise, or dehydration. It is not associated with chronic kidney disease or anemia.
* C. Tubular proteinuria occurs when there is damage to the tubules in the kidneys, leading to proteinuria. This is not supported by the patient's laboratory results.
* D. Orthostatic proteinuria is a condition where proteinuria occurs only when the patient is standing upright. This is not supported by the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.
* E. Isolated proteinuria is a diagnosis of exclusion, where proteinuria is present without any other signs of kidney disease. This is not supported by the patient's laboratory results, which show evidence of chronic kidney disease.",Success
"A 68-year-old postmenopausal woman presents to the clinic for a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. The patient states that she has mild joint pain, which she attributes to osteoarthritis, but she notes no recent fractures. She says that her mother had osteoporosis and she is concerned that she may develop it as well. She takes calcium and vitamin D supplements daily. After review of her DEXA scan, her physician states that she has osteopenia. Which of the following is this patient’s most likely DEXA scan result?",D,"The correct answer is D. T-score of -1.6.

Here's why:

Osteopenia is a condition characterized by bone density that is lower than normal, but not low enough to be classified as osteoporosis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, osteopenia is defined as a T-score between -1 and -2.5.

A T-score is a measure of bone density that compares the patient's bone density to that of a healthy young adult of the same sex. A T-score of 0 represents the average bone density of a healthy young adult, while a negative T-score indicates lower bone density.

Option A, a T-score of 1.2, is actually above average bone density, so it's not consistent with osteopenia.

Option B, a T-score of -0.8, is close to average bone density, but not low enough to be classified as osteopenia.

Option C, a Z-score of -2.0, is not relevant to this question. A Z-score compares the patient's bone density to that of others of the same age, sex, and ethnicity, whereas a T-score compares it to that of a healthy young adult.

Option E, a T-score of -2.7, is actually consistent with osteoporosis, not osteopenia.

Therefore, the most likely DEXA scan result for this patient with osteopenia is a T-score of -1.6, which falls within the range of -1 to -2.5.",Success
"An investigator is studying the growth pattern of a particular bacterial strain that caused a respiratory disease outbreak in children in rural Venezuela.

The isolated bacteria are most likely which of the following?",E,"The correct answer is E. Corynebacterium diphtheriae.

Here's why:

The description of the bacterial growth pattern and colony characteristics points to Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The presence of sheep blood, cystine, and potassium tellurite in the culture medium is consistent with the requirements for growing C. diphtheriae. The black, shining colonies are also a distinctive feature of C. diphtheriae growth.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Legionella pneumophila: While Legionella can cause respiratory disease, it doesn't require sheep blood, cystine, and potassium tellurite for growth, and its colonies don't typically have a black, shining surface.

B. Mycobacterium tuberculosis: M. tuberculosis is typically grown on Lowenstein-Jensen medium, which doesn't contain sheep blood, cystine, and potassium tellurite. Its colonies also don't have a black, shining surface.

C. Haemophilus influenzae: H. influenzae requires X and V factors for growth, but not sheep blood, cystine, and potassium tellurite. Its colonies are typically small, grayish, and translucent.

D. Bordetella pertussis: B. pertussis is typically grown on Bordet-Gengou medium, which contains potato starch, glycerol, and sheep blood, but not cystine and potassium tellurite. Its colonies are usually small, grayish, and irregularly shaped.

His temperature is 37.7°C (99.8°F), blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, pulse is 150/min, and respirations are 50/min. His tongue protrudes beyond the teeth. Neck veins are distended. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows an S3 gallop. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Neurologic examination shows profound weakness in proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities. He has 2+ reflexes bilaterally. A chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly. Serum glucose is 105 mg/dL. Which of the following is the enzyme most likely to be defective in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Lysosomal acid maltase.

This patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Pompe disease, a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (also known as lysosomal acid maltase). The symptoms include:

* Fatigue, weakness, and difficulty feeding, which are indicative of muscle weakness
* Delayed motor milestones, such as not being able to sit upright on his own
* Tongue protrusion, which is a sign of muscle weakness
* Distended neck veins, crackles in the lungs, and an S3 gallop, which suggest cardiac involvement
* Hepatomegaly (enlarged liver)
* Proximal and distal muscle weakness, which is characteristic of Pompe disease

Pompe disease is caused by a deficiency of lysosomal acid maltase, which is necessary for the breakdown of glycogen in lysosomes. The accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes leads to cellular damage and muscle weakness.

The other options are not correct because:

* A. Muscle glycogen phosphorylase is an enzyme involved in glycogenolysis in muscle cells, but its deficiency would not cause the symptoms seen in this patient.
* B. Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is an enzyme involved in fatty acid oxidation, and its deficiency would cause a different set of symptoms, such as hypoketotic hypoglycemia and muscle weakness.
* D. Glucose-6-phosphatase is an enzyme involved in glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and its deficiency would cause glycogen storage disease type I, which has a different set of symptoms, such as hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly.
* E. Glycogen debranching enzyme is an enzyme involved in glycogenolysis, and its deficiency would cause glycogen storage disease type III, which has a different set of symptoms, such as hepatomegaly and muscle weakness, but not the cardiac involvement seen in this patient.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely enzyme defect is lysosomal acid maltase, which is consistent with Pompe disease.",Success

Hemoglobin 8 g/dL
Leukocyte count 1400/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 20%
Eosinophils 0.5%
Lymphocytes 87%
Monocytes 1%
Platelet count 110,000/mm3
Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?""",E,"The correct answer is E. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.

Justification:

The patient is a 4-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who has undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. He has developed a fever, which is a common complication in neutropenic patients. The laboratory results show a low leukocyte count (1400/mm3) with a low percentage of segmented neutrophils (20%), indicating neutropenia.

In this scenario, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF is a cytokine that stimulates the production of granulocytes and macrophages, which can help to increase the neutrophil count and reduce the risk of infection in neutropenic patients.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Alkylating chemotherapeutic agent: This type of agent is not indicated for the treatment of neutropenia or fever in a patient who has already undergone conditioning regimen for bone marrow transplantation.

B. Transforming growth factor-β: This cytokine is not typically used to treat neutropenia or fever in patients with leukemia.

C. Erythropoietin: This medication is used to stimulate the production of red blood cells, which is not the primary concern in this patient.

D. Interleukin-5: This cytokine is involved in the production of eosinophils, which are not a concern in this patient given the low eosinophil count (0.5%).

According to current medical guidelines, GM-CSF is recommended for the treatment of neutropenia in patients undergoing chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation.",Success
"A 27-year-old female is brought to the emergency department by police when she attacked her date outside of a pizza restaurant. The patient refused to explain her behavior to the police.

Which of the following is the next best step in management for this patient's underlying condition?",E,"The correct answer is D. Urine toxicology.

Based on the patient's presentation, medical history, and laboratory results, the next best step in management is to perform a urine toxicology screen. Here's why:

1. The patient's behavior, such as responding to internal stimuli and attacking her date, suggests a possible psychotic episode.
2. The patient's medical history of depression, anxiety, and medication non-compliance raises concerns about potential substance abuse or medication interactions.
3. The physical exam findings, including multiple oropharyngeal ulcers and a friction rub, may indicate self-harm or other harmful behaviors.
4. The laboratory results show mild electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, and a slightly elevated creatinine level, which could be related to underlying medical conditions or substance abuse.

Given these factors, it is essential to rule out substance abuse or intoxication as a contributing factor to the patient's behavior. A urine toxicology screen can help identify the presence of drugs, such as phencyclidine (PCP), cocaine, or amphetamines, which can cause psychotic symptoms.

The other options are not the next best step in management:

A. IM haloperidol: While haloperidol is an antipsychotic medication, it is not the next best step in management without further evaluation and diagnosis.

B. Haloperidol depot: This is not a relevant option at this stage, as the patient's diagnosis and treatment plan are still being determined.

C. Clozapine: This antipsychotic medication is typically reserved for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and its use is not indicated at this point in the patient's evaluation.

E. ANA and anti-dsDNA levels: These tests are used to diagnose autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, which is not the primary concern in this patient's presentation.

By performing a urine toxicology screen, the healthcare team can gather more information to guide further evaluation and management of the patient's underlying condition.",Success
"A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of fever, abdominal pain, and rapidly progressive distension of the abdomen. His appendix was removed for an abscess 3 days ago. The complete blood count showed leukocytosis. Anaerobic culture of the peritoneal fluid needle aspirate showed a gram-negative pathogen. Which of the following, in addition to polymicrobial infection, is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Bacteroides fragilis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, abdominal pain, and rapidly progressive distension of the abdomen, are consistent with peritonitis, an infection of the peritoneum. The fact that the patient had an appendectomy 3 days prior suggests that the infection may be related to the surgical procedure.

The anaerobic culture of the peritoneal fluid needle aspirate showing a gram-negative pathogen points towards Bacteroides fragilis as the most likely cause. B. fragilis is a common anaerobic gram-negative bacterium that is part of the normal gut flora. It is often implicated in intra-abdominal infections, including peritonitis, particularly in the setting of a recent surgical procedure.

Polymicrobial infection is also likely, given the patient's symptoms and the fact that B. fragilis is often found in conjunction with other bacteria in intra-abdominal infections.

The other options are less likely:

* Campylobacter jejuni (B) is a gram-negative bacterium that can cause gastroenteritis, but it is not typically associated with peritonitis or intra-abdominal infections.
* Clostridium perfringens (C) is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause gas gangrene and food poisoning, but it is not typically associated with peritonitis or intra-abdominal infections.
* Salmonella serotype typhi (D) is a gram-negative bacterium that causes typhoid fever, but it is not typically associated with peritonitis or intra-abdominal infections.
* Shigella sonnei (E) is a gram-negative bacterium that causes shigellosis, a type of food poisoning, but it is not typically associated with peritonitis or intra-abdominal infections.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the anaerobic culture results, Bacteroides fragilis is the most likely cause of this patient's condition, in addition to polymicrobial infection.",Success

They both use hydrating creams and topical glucocorticoids with moderate benefit. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Psoriatic arthritis.

Here's why:

* The patient presents with symptoms of joint inflammation, specifically in the distal interphalangeal joints, which is a characteristic feature of psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
* The presence of pitted and cracked nails, also known as nail psoriasis, is a common finding in PsA.
* The rough, erythematous skin patches on the elbows, which have been present for months, suggest psoriasis, a chronic skin condition that often co-exists with PsA.
* The patient's family history of a similar condition, likely psoriasis, further supports the diagnosis of PsA.
* The patient's response to hydrating creams and topical glucocorticoids, although moderate, is consistent with the treatment of psoriasis and PsA.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

* A. Gout: Typically presents with sudden, severe joint pain, often in the big toe, and is not associated with nail or skin changes.
* B. Reactive arthritis: Typically occurs after a gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection and is not associated with nail or skin changes.
* D. Enteropathic arthropathies: Are a group of conditions that occur in association with inflammatory bowel disease, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.
* E. Dermatomyositis: Is a condition characterized by muscle weakness and skin rash, but not typically associated with joint inflammation or nail changes.

Two weeks later, she returns with a skin rash, diarrhea, and confusion, and is given a factor to take in addition to the medications previously prescribed. Which of the following is a characteristic of the factor that was most likely provided?",B,"The correct answer is B. Required for dehydrogenase enzymes.

The patient's symptoms and the acid-fast stain result suggest that she has tuberculosis (TB), which is typically treated with a combination of antibiotics, including isoniazid (INH). Isoniazid is known to cause vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency, which can lead to a range of symptoms including skin rash, diarrhea, and confusion.

Vitamin B6 is required as a coenzyme for various dehydrogenase enzymes involved in several metabolic pathways. It plays a crucial role in many bodily functions, including energy metabolism, nerve function, and immune system function.

The other options are not directly related to the factor that was likely provided to the patient:

A. Vitamin C is required for collagen hydroxylation, but it is not typically associated with TB treatment or the symptoms described.

C. Vitamin B12 is required for methionine processing, but it is not directly related to TB treatment or the symptoms described.

D. Vitamin B12 is also required for methylmalonyl-CoA processing, but again, it is not directly related to TB treatment or the symptoms described.

E. Thiamine (vitamin B1) is required for transketolase function, but it is not typically associated with TB treatment or the symptoms described.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the likely treatment for TB, the correct answer is B. Required for dehydrogenase enzymes, which refers to vitamin B6.",Success
"A 51-year-old Asian woman presents to her primary care provider with abdominal pain. On examination, she is found to have rebound tenderness in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen. Further workup suggests ovarian cancer, which is confirmed later in the week to be stage 4 with confirmed distant metastases in the lungs and brain. Which of the following routes describes the most likely lymphatic route for this malignancy to have metastasized to the brain?",E,"The correct answer is E. Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation.

Here's why:

Ovarian cancer typically spreads through the lymphatic system, and the most likely route for metastasis to the brain would be through the thoracic duct, which drains into the left subclavian vein. From there, the cancer cells can enter the systemic circulation and travel to the brain.

Here's a breakdown of the correct route:

* Sentinel node: The tumor cells from the ovarian cancer drain into the sentinel lymph node, which is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from the tumor.
* Right lumbar trunk: The sentinel node drains into the right lumbar trunk, which is a lymphatic vessel that collects lymph from the lower abdomen and pelvis.
* Cisterna chyli: The right lumbar trunk drains into the cisterna chyli, a dilated lymphatic vessel that receives lymph from the lower abdomen and pelvis.
* Thoracic duct: The cisterna chyli drains into the thoracic duct, the largest lymphatic vessel in the body, which collects lymph from the lower body and drains into the left subclavian vein.
* Left subclavian vein: The thoracic duct drains into the left subclavian vein, which returns lymph to the systemic circulation.
* Systemic circulation: From the left subclavian vein, the cancer cells can enter the systemic circulation and travel to the brain.

The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the lymphatic route from the ovary to the brain. Options A and C involve the right lymphatic duct, which drains into the right subclavian vein, not the left subclavian vein. Option B involves the left lumbar trunk, which is not the correct route from the ovary. Option D involves the right subclavian vein, which is also not the correct route.",Success

Abdominal examination shows mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound or guarding. A CT scan of the abdomen is shown. The structure indicated by the arrows is most likely lined by which of the following?",C,"The correct answer is A. Simple ductal epithelium.

The CT scan of the abdomen shows a pancreatic pseudocyst, which is a fluid-filled sac that forms in the pancreas as a complication of pancreatitis. The arrows likely point to the wall of the pseudocyst.

The lining of a pancreatic pseudocyst is typically composed of simple ductal epithelium, which is a type of epithelial tissue that lines the ducts of the pancreas. This type of epithelium is responsible for producing and secreting digestive enzymes.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

B. Calcified ductal cells are not a characteristic feature of pancreatic pseudocysts.

C. Granulation tissue is a type of tissue that forms during the healing process, but it is not typically associated with the lining of pancreatic pseudocysts.

D. Pyogenic membrane is a type of inflammatory tissue that forms in response to infection, but it is not typically associated with pancreatic pseudocysts.

E. Columnar mucinous epithelium is a type of epithelial tissue that lines the gastrointestinal tract, but it is not typically associated with the lining of pancreatic pseudocysts.

"An 80-year-old African American man is brought to the emergency department in a confused state with history of general illness for the past week. He is known to be hypertensive, but noncompliant with medications for the last 20 years. Physical examination reveals dry skin, ecchymoses, and conjunctival pallor. His blood pressure is 180/99 mm Hg, heart rate is 89/min, and respiratory rate is 17/min. The initial laboratory results are remarkable for hemoglobin of 10 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 90 μm3, platelet count of 200,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen of 29 mg/dL, and creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL. Which of the following would be the best initial management for this patient's condition?",A,"The correct answer is C. Calcium channel blocker (CCB).

The patient's presentation suggests a diagnosis of hypertension with possible hypertensive emergency, given the elevated blood pressure (180/99 mm Hg) and symptoms of confusion. The patient's non-compliance with medications for 20 years and physical examination findings (dry skin, ecchymoses, and conjunctival pallor) also suggest possible volume depletion.

When initiating antihypertensive therapy in an elderly patient with hypertension, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a diuretic as the first-line agent. CCBs are particularly useful in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, which is common in this age group.

In this case, a CCB is a good choice because it:

1. Has a rapid onset of action, which is important in a hypertensive emergency.
2. Is effective in reducing blood pressure in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension.
3. Has a relatively low risk of adverse effects, such as bradycardia or heart block, which are more common with beta-blockers.

The other options are not the best initial management for this patient's condition:

A. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI): While ACEIs are effective antihypertensives, they may not be the best choice in this patient due to the risk of hyperkalemia, particularly in patients with renal impairment (creatinine 2.1 mg/dL).

B. Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB): Similar to ACEIs, ARBs may not be the best choice due to the risk of hyperkalemia and potential interactions with other medications.

D. Beta-blocker (BB): Beta-blockers are not recommended as first-line agents in elderly patients with hypertension, especially in those with isolated systolic hypertension. They can also exacerbate bradycardia and heart block.

E. Thiazide: While thiazides are effective diuretics, they may not be the best choice in this patient due to the risk of volume depletion, which is already suspected based on the physical examination findings.

In summary, a calcium channel blocker (CCB) is the best initial management for this patient's condition, given its rapid onset of action, effectiveness in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension, and relatively low risk of adverse effects.",Success

Sputum culture grows Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A sweat test shows chloride concentration of 85 mEq/L (elevated). Which of the following is involved in the pathogenesis of this patient’s symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Abnormal CFTR protein.

The patient's symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, cough, poor weight gain, and frequent stools with an unpleasant smell, are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). The diagnosis is confirmed by the elevated sweat chloride concentration of 85 mEq/L, which is a hallmark of CF.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which codes for a protein that regulates chloride and water transport across epithelial cells. The abnormal CFTR protein leads to impaired mucociliary clearance, thickened mucus, and chronic lung infections, as seen in this patient.

The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of this patient's symptoms:

A. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that can cause lung disease, but it is not associated with the symptoms described in this patient.

C. Eosinophils are not typically involved in the pathogenesis of CF.

D. Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that affects the electron transport chain, but it is not related to CF.

E. Mutations in dynein can cause primary ciliary dyskinesia, a rare genetic disorder that affects ciliary function, but it is not the primary cause of this patient's symptoms.

The growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum culture is consistent with CF, as this bacterium is a common pathogen in CF patients.",Success
"A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of worsening grades over the past year. Since she started high school one year ago, her academic performance has decreased. She also has had difficulty finding friends at the new school. She is afraid that her classmates will make fun of her and think that she is “stupid.” One month ago, when she had to give a presentation, she could not stop wondering how her classmates were going to react if she said something wrong. During the presentation, her heart started racing and she became flushed. Since this event, she avoids saying anything in class. She spends her breaks in the restroom because she is worried that nobody will talk to her. Physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, the girl avoids eye contact and appears uncomfortable and anxious. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Fluoxetine.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia. She experiences excessive and persistent fear of social or performance situations in which she may be judged by others, leading to avoidance behaviors and significant distress. The patient's symptoms include fear of being embarrassed or humiliated, avoidance of social situations, and physical symptoms such as a racing heart and flushing during the presentation.

Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is commonly used to treat SAD in adolescents. SSRIs are considered first-line pharmacotherapy for SAD, and fluoxetine has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of SAD in this age group.

Clomipramine (A) is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used to treat SAD, but it has more side effects and is typically reserved for patients who do not respond to SSRIs.

Phenelzine (B) is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that can be used to treat SAD, but it has a higher risk of side effects and dietary restrictions, making it a less preferred option.

Clonazepam (C) is a benzodiazepine that can be used to treat anxiety, but it is not a preferred treatment for SAD due to the risk of dependence and withdrawal symptoms.

Propranolol (E) is a beta blocker that can be used to treat performance anxiety, but it is not a preferred treatment for SAD.

It's worth noting that before starting pharmacotherapy, the patient should undergo a thorough diagnostic evaluation, and psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), should be considered as a first-line treatment for SAD in adolescents.",Success
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his parents because he ‘hasn’t been himself lately’ and reportedly gets tired very easily from his swimming classes in comparison to the other kids. He also ‘can’t catch his breath’ at times. The mother also reports that he seems to be slightly shorter than other children his age. His temperature is 36.6°C (97.9°F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 14/min. On auscultation, a localized harsh pansystolic murmur is heard over the left sternal border at the level of the 2nd–3rd intercostal space. The murmur becomes louder when the patient is asked to squat. An echocardiogram is performed. Which of the structures below gives rise to the defective structure that is causing this patient’s symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is C. Infundibular septum.

The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and a localized harsh pansystolic murmur over the left sternal border, are consistent with a diagnosis of ventricular septal defect (VSD). The fact that the murmur becomes louder when the patient squats suggests that the VSD is a muscular VSD, which is a type of VSD that occurs in the muscular portion of the ventricular septum.

The infundibular septum is a structure that develops from the bulbar septum and contributes to the formation of the ventricular septum. A defect in the infundibular septum can result in a VSD, which is the likely cause of this patient's symptoms.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Aortopulmonary septum: This structure gives rise to the aorticopulmonary septum, which separates the aorta and pulmonary artery. A defect in this structure would result in an aortopulmonary window, not a VSD.

B. Endocardial cushion: This structure gives rise to the atrioventricular septum and the atrioventricular valves. A defect in this structure would result in an atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), not a VSD.

D. 3rd pharyngeal arch: This structure gives rise to the inferior parathyroid glands and the thymus. It is not related to the development of the ventricular septum or the heart.

E. Rathke's pouch: This structure gives rise to the anterior pituitary gland. It is not related to the development of the ventricular septum or the heart.

It's worth noting that an echocardiogram would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of VSD and to determine the location and size of the defect.",Success
"A 26-year-old woman developed rapidly progressive septic shock associated with nuchal rigidity, petechiae, and purpura. She tested positive for both Kernig and Brudzinski's signs and shows signs of confusion, dyspnea, and hypotension. The blood culture results confirmed the presence of Neisseria meningitidis, and a complete blood count (CBC) revealed leukocytosis. Which one of the cytokines below takes part in the pathogenesis of septic shock?",A,"The correct answer is A. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α).

Here's why:

Neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative bacterium that can cause meningitis and septic shock. The patient's symptoms, including septic shock, nuchal rigidity, petechiae, and purpura, are consistent with meningococcal disease.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of septic shock. It is produced by macrophages and other immune cells in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and other stimuli. TNF-α causes vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and activation of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to the development of septic shock.

The other options are not directly involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock:

* Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is involved in the regulation of eosinophil function and is not typically associated with septic shock.
* Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is involved in the regulation of cell-mediated immunity and is not a key player in septic shock.
* Interferon-α (IFN-α) is involved in the regulation of antiviral responses and is not typically associated with septic shock.
* Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can counteract the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, but it is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, emphasize the importance of early recognition and treatment of septic shock, including the use of antibiotics and vasopressors to manage hypotension.",Success
A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of episodes of difficulty swallowing for the past 3 months. He feels solid food getting stuck in his chest behind the sternum when he eats. Drinking does not cause any difficulty swallowing. He has no coughing or nasal regurgitation. He has no hoarseness or weight loss. He has had heartburn for 2 years with no response to high-dose omeprazole. His past medical history is also significant for asthma and eczema. He takes no medications except for omeprazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormal findings. Which of the following best explains these findings?,C,"The correct answer is C. Eosinophilic esophagitis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing solid food, feeling of food getting stuck in the chest, and no difficulty with liquids are consistent with dysphagia. The absence of coughing, nasal regurgitation, hoarseness, and weight loss suggests that the problem is not related to oropharyngeal dysphagia or a neurological disorder.

The patient's history of heartburn for 2 years with no response to high-dose omeprazole suggests that gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may not be the primary cause of his symptoms. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are not typical of GERD, which usually presents with regurgitation, coughing, and chest pain.

Achalasia (Option A) is a motility disorder characterized by difficulty swallowing both solids and liquids, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Diffuse esophageal spasm (Option B) is a motility disorder that can cause chest pain and dysphagia, but it is not typically associated with solid food dysphagia or the feeling of food getting stuck in the chest.

Schatzki's ring (Option E) is a rare condition that causes dysphagia, but it is usually associated with a sudden onset of symptoms and is not typically associated with heartburn.

Eosinophilic esophagitis (Option C) is an inflammatory condition characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus, which can cause dysphagia, particularly with solid foods. The patient's symptoms, along with his history of asthma and eczema, which are common comorbidities with eosinophilic esophagitis, make this the most likely diagnosis.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and medical history are most consistent with eosinophilic esophagitis, which is the best explanation for his findings.",Success
"A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. He was at work as a construction worker when his coworkers found him down at the work site. The patient recently underwent anesthesia for an appendectomy several months ago. He also has a past medical history of schizophrenia well controlled with haloperidol and is currently taking phenytoin for epilepsy. He is also currently taking propranolol for anxiety and hyperthyroidism. His temperature is 106°F (41.1°C), blood pressure is 109/62 mmHg, pulse is 170/min, respirations are 23/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an altered man with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 10. He has minimal muscle tone and is incoherent when answering questions. The patient is covered in sweat and dirt. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Exertional heat stroke.

Here's why:

* The patient's presentation with altered mental status, high fever (106°F), and tachycardia (170/min) suggests a hyperthermic emergency.
* The patient's occupation as a construction worker and being found down at the work site suggests that he may have been engaging in strenuous physical activity in a hot environment, which increases the risk of exertional heat stroke.
* The patient's physical exam findings, including minimal muscle tone, incoherence, and profuse sweating, are consistent with heat stroke.
* The patient's medical history, including schizophrenia and epilepsy, does not seem to be directly related to the current presentation. The medications he is taking, such as haloperidol, phenytoin, and propranolol, do not seem to be contributing to the current symptoms.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

* B. Malignant hyperthermia is a rare genetic disorder that is typically triggered by certain anesthetics, and the patient's recent appendectomy does not seem to be related to the current presentation.
* C. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but life-threatening side effect of antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol. However, NMS typically presents with muscle rigidity, not minimal muscle tone, and the patient's fever is more severe than what is typically seen in NMS.
* D. Status epilepticus is a prolonged seizure or a series of seizures without a return to baseline consciousness. The patient's presentation does not suggest seizure activity, and his epilepsy is well-controlled with phenytoin.
* E. Thyroid storm is a life-threatening complication of hyperthyroidism, but the patient's symptoms do not suggest thyroid storm, and his hyperthyroidism is being treated with propranolol.

In summary, the patient's presentation is most consistent with exertional heat stroke, which is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention and cooling measures to prevent further complications.",Success
"A 67-year-old man is brought to the hospital by his relatives. He complains of early satiety, abdominal discomfort after food intake, and abdominal bloating. These symptoms have been present since the patient was 52, but they were milder at that time so he paid little attention to them since. Tingling and decreased sensation in both lower extremities began a few months ago. His relatives also note that he has become excessively somnolent and forgetful. The patient’s medical history is significant for acute hepatitis B 20 years ago. He smokes a pack of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol occasionally. His weight is 61 kg (134.5 lb), height is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in), and BMI is 18.6 kg/m2. His vital signs include: blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate 89/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.1°C (96.9°F). The patient’s skin is pale, thin, dry, and hypoelastic. Lymph nodes and the thyroid gland are not enlarged. Lung and heart examinations are within normal limits for his age. The patient’s tongue is bright red with atrophic papillae.

Conjugated bilirubin 8 µmol/L (0.4677 mg/L)
Which of the following options best explains the patient’s neurological and psychiatric symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids.

The patient's symptoms, including tingling and decreased sensation in both lower extremities, somnolence, and forgetfulness, suggest a neurological disorder. The patient's laboratory results show a macrocytic anemia, which is characterized by an increased mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and a low hemoglobin level. This type of anemia is often associated with vitamin B12 deficiency.

Vitamin B12 plays a crucial role in the metabolism of fatty acids and the synthesis of myelin, the fatty substance that surrounds and protects nerve fibers. A deficiency in vitamin B12 can lead to impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids, resulting in demyelination and neurological symptoms.

The patient's history of acute hepatitis B 20 years ago and his current symptoms are consistent with a vitamin B12 deficiency caused by impaired absorption of the vitamin due to chronic liver disease. The patient's somnolence and forgetfulness may also be related to the vitamin B12 deficiency, as it can cause neurological symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and cognitive impairment.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Chronic bilirubin toxicity is not a likely explanation for the patient's symptoms, as his total bilirubin level is within normal limits.

B. Chronic hyperglycemia is not supported by the patient's laboratory results, which show a normal fasting plasma glucose level.

C. Chronic acetaldehyde influence is not a plausible explanation for the patient's symptoms, as there is no evidence of chronic alcohol abuse or liver disease.

E. Influence of pseudo-neurotransmitters is not a recognized medical concept and is not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

In conclusion, the patient's neurological and psychiatric symptoms are best explained by impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids due to a vitamin B12 deficiency, likely caused by chronic liver disease.",Success
"A four-day-old neonate is brought to the pediatrician with vaginal discharge for the last two days. Her mother is concerned about the blood-tinged discharge but states that her daughter has been feeding and voiding well. The neonate was delivered at 39 weeks gestation by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, and she and her mother were discharged home after two days. The prenatal course was complicated by chlamydia in the mother during the first trimester, for which she and the partner were both treated with a negative test of cure. The neonate’s biological father is no longer involved the patient's care, but her mother’s boyfriend has been caring for the baby whenever the mother rests. At this visit, the neonate’s temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), pulse is 138/min, and respirations are 51/min. She appears comfortable, and cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. There are no bruises or marks on her skin. Examination of the genitals reveals no vulvar irritation or skin changes, but there is scant pink mucoid discharge at the introitus. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",E,"The correct answer is E. Reassurance.

Here's why:

The symptoms described, including the blood-tinged discharge, are consistent with a normal physiologic process in newborn females. The discharge is likely due to the withdrawal of maternal hormones after birth, which can cause a brief period of vaginal bleeding or discharge. This phenomenon is known as pseudomenstruation or vaginal bleeding of the newborn.

Given the neonate's overall healthy appearance, normal vital signs, and lack of any concerning physical exam findings, there is no indication for further invasive testing or evaluation. The mother's history of chlamydia in the first trimester is not relevant to the current presentation, as she was treated and had a negative test of cure.

There is no suspicion of child abuse or neglect, so reporting to child protective services is not warranted. Vaginal exam under anesthesia is not necessary, and vaginal culture is not indicated in this scenario. Warm water irrigation of the vagina is also not necessary and may potentially cause more harm than good.

Reassurance is the best next step, as the symptoms are likely benign and will resolve on their own. The pediatrician should educate the mother on the normalcy of this phenomenon and provide guidance on gentle genital hygiene and monitoring for any signs of infection or other concerning symptoms.",Success

HCV RNA: 100,000,000 IU/ml

This patient should be started on which of the following medications?",A,"The correct answer is A. Sofosbuvir and simeprevir.

The patient's laboratory results indicate that he has chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, as evidenced by the presence of HCV RNA in his blood. The patient's medical history and laboratory results rule out other potential causes of his symptoms, such as hepatitis A or B.

The treatment of choice for chronic HCV infection is direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. Sofosbuvir and simeprevir are both DAAs that are commonly used in combination to treat HCV genotype 1, which is the most common genotype in the United States.

Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide analogue inhibitor of the HCV NS5B polymerase, while simeprevir is a protease inhibitor that targets the HCV NS3/4A protease. The combination of sofosbuvir and simeprevir has been shown to be highly effective in achieving sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients with chronic HCV infection.

Interferon-alpha (option B) was previously used to treat HCV, but it is no longer recommended as first-line therapy due to its significant side effects and lower efficacy compared to DAA therapy. Interferon-gamma (option C) is not approved for the treatment of HCV. Ribavirin (option D) is sometimes used in combination with DAAs, but it is not effective as monotherapy and is not recommended as first-line therapy. Lamivudine (option E) is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV infection, not HCV infection.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Sofosbuvir and simeprevir.",Success

What is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is D. Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

Here's why:

* The patient presents with a 3-week history of a painless, non-tender swelling in the anterior triangle of her neck, which is consistent with a thyroid nodule or goiter.
* The associated symptoms of sweaty palms and soles, insomnia, irritability, nervousness, and fatigue suggest hyperthyroidism, which is a common presentation of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
* The patient's medical history is negative for similar symptoms or a thyroid disorder, making it likely that this is a new onset of thyroiditis.
* The vital signs are within normal limits, which rules out other causes of thyroiditis, such as infectious thyroiditis (e.g., De Quervain's thyroiditis), which would typically present with fever and other systemic symptoms.
* The laboratory results show a normal white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which further supports the diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
* Graves' disease (Option A) is less likely, as it typically presents with a diffuse goiter, exophthalmos, and other systemic symptoms, which are not mentioned in this case.
* Silent thyroiditis (Option C) is also less likely, as it typically presents with a more acute onset of symptoms and may have a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
* Riedel's thyroiditis (Option E) is a rare and invasive form of thyroiditis that typically presents with a hard, woody thyroid gland and is often associated with other systemic symptoms, which are not mentioned in this case.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a common cause of thyroiditis in adults, and its presentation with a painless goiter and hyperthyroid symptoms is consistent with this patient's symptoms.",Success

Family history is significant for a grandmother who suffered from fibromyalgia. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, respiratory rate is 16/min, and heart rate is 70/min. On physical examination, her metacarpophalangeal joints are erythematous and tender. Which of the following would be most helpful for diagnosing this patient’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody.

The patient's symptoms, such as morning stiffness, wrist and neck pain, and tender metacarpophalangeal joints, are consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Anti-CCP antibody is a specific autoantibody that is often present in the serum of patients with RA, particularly in those with early disease. It is a useful diagnostic test for RA, especially in patients with a high clinical suspicion of the disease.

Here's why the other options are not the best choice:

A. Synovial fluid analysis: While synovial fluid analysis can provide information about joint inflammation, it is not a specific test for RA and may not be diagnostic in early disease.

C. Rheumatoid factor: Rheumatoid factor (RF) is a non-specific antibody that can be present in various conditions, including RA, Sjögren's syndrome, and lupus. While RF can be elevated in RA, it is not as specific as anti-CCP antibody and may not be diagnostic in early disease.

D. CT scan: A CT scan is not typically used to diagnose RA, as it is not sensitive for detecting joint inflammation or bone erosion.

E. X-ray of cervical spine: While an X-ray of the cervical spine may be useful in evaluating neck pain, it is not specific for RA and may not show any abnormalities in early disease.

According to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2010 classification criteria for RA, the presence of anti-CCP antibody is one of the diagnostic criteria for RA, particularly in patients with early disease.",Success

Ultrasound of the liver and kidneys shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?""",D,"The correct answer is C. Renal deposition of AL amyloid.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by proteinuria (3+ protein in the urine), edema, and hypoalbuminemia (low serum albumin level of 2.8 g/dl). The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and the presence of rheumatoid factor suggest an underlying autoimmune disorder.

The key finding that points to the correct answer is the presence of rheumatoid nodules on the patient's fingers. This, combined with the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis, increases the likelihood of amyloidosis, a complication of chronic inflammatory disorders like rheumatoid arthritis. AL amyloidosis is a type of amyloidosis that occurs when abnormal proteins produced by the bone marrow accumulate in organs such as the kidneys, leading to nephrotic syndrome.

Option A, adverse effect of ibuprofen, is unlikely because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are not consistent with ibuprofen-induced nephrotoxicity.

Option B, decreased cardiac ejection fraction, may contribute to the patient's edema, but it does not explain the proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia.

Option D, increased serum amyloid A production, is related to AA amyloidosis, which is a different type of amyloidosis that occurs in response to chronic inflammation. While it's possible that the patient may have AA amyloidosis, the presence of rheumatoid nodules and the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis make AL amyloidosis a more likely diagnosis.

Option E, renal deposition of anti-dsDNA immune complexes, is more consistent with lupus nephritis, which is not supported by the patient's history and laboratory results.

In summary, the combination of the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and history of rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatoid nodules make renal deposition of AL amyloid the most likely cause of this patient's findings.",Success

Ophthalmologic examination reveals multi-colored irises with concentric rings around the periphery (findings shown in the photo). Sensation and motor functions are preserved. Which of the following would you expect to be abnormally accumulated in this patient’s tissues?",C,"The correct answer is C. Copper.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Wilson's disease, a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of copper in the body. The key features that point to this diagnosis include:

1. Neurological symptoms: Unsteady gait, dysmetria, intention tremor, dysarthria, and dystonia are all indicative of basal ganglia dysfunction, which is a hallmark of Wilson's disease.
2. Ophthalmologic findings: The presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, which are multi-colored irises with concentric rings around the periphery, is a pathognomonic sign of Wilson's disease. These rings are caused by the deposition of copper in the Descemet's membrane of the cornea.
3. Absence of sensory and motor deficits: Wilson's disease typically spares sensory and motor functions, which is consistent with the patient's preserved sensation and motor functions.

Copper accumulation in the body is the primary defect in Wilson's disease, leading to toxicity and damage to various organs, including the brain, liver, and eyes. The other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Arsenic poisoning can cause neurological symptoms, but it is not typically associated with Kayser-Fleischer rings or copper accumulation.

B. Iron accumulation is seen in hemochromatosis, which is characterized by bronze skin, liver disease, and diabetes, but not by the neurological symptoms and ophthalmologic findings seen in this patient.

D. Lead poisoning can cause neurological symptoms, but it is not typically associated with Kayser-Fleischer rings or copper accumulation.

The exotoxin produced by C. diphtheriae acts by ADP-ribosylating elongation factor 2 (EF-2), which inhibits protein synthesis and leads to cell death. This toxin is responsible for the local and systemic manifestations of diphtheria.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Yeast with pseudohyphae: This description is consistent with Candida, a fungus that can cause oral thrush, but it does not match the symptoms and physical examination findings of the patient.

C. Gram-positive cocci with hyaluronic acid capsule: This description is consistent with Streptococcus pyogenes, which can cause pharyngitis, but it does not match the symptoms and physical examination findings of the patient.

D. Gram-negative encapsulated bacteria producing IgA protease: This description is consistent with Haemophilus influenzae, which can cause respiratory infections, but it does not match the symptoms and physical examination findings of the patient.

E. Gram-negative bacteria producing exotoxin that inactivates elongation factor 2: This description is similar to the correct answer, but it is not specific to C. diphtheriae. The toxin produced by C. diphtheriae is unique in its mechanism of action, which involves ADP-ribosylation of EF-2.

It's worth noting that diphtheria is a rare disease in the United States, but it is still seen in immigrants from countries where vaccination rates are low. The patient's recent immigration from Russia increases the likelihood of diphtheria, as vaccination rates may be lower in that country.",Success
"A 17-year-old male presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient was an unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. He has a past medical history of asthma, depression, and anxiety. He is not currently taking any medications. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. The patient is breathing on his own and has strong distal pulses. Ultimately, the patient is discharged with follow up instructions after no significant fractures or injuries are found. The patient then presents 4 months later to his primary doctor with weakness. The patient's strength in his upper extremities is 1/5. He has reduced sensation in his upper extremities as well. The patient's lower extremities reveal 5/5 strength with intact sensation. A chest radiograph and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is D. Brachial plexopathy.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including weakness (1/5 strength) and reduced sensation in the upper extremities, with normal strength and sensation in the lower extremities, suggest a lesion affecting the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that originates in the neck and shoulder region and supplies the arm.

The patient's history of a motor vehicle accident, particularly a head-on collision, increases the likelihood of a brachial plexus injury. This type of injury can occur when the neck and shoulder are stretched or compressed, causing damage to the brachial plexus.

Option A, cervical spine fracture, is unlikely because the patient's initial evaluation in the emergency department did not reveal any significant fractures or injuries. Additionally, a cervical spine fracture would likely cause more widespread neurological deficits, including lower extremity involvement.

Option B, intracranial hemorrhage, is also unlikely because the patient's symptoms are limited to the upper extremities, and there is no mention of altered mental status, headache, or other signs of intracranial bleeding.

Option C, syringomyelia, is a rare condition characterized by a fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord. While it can cause upper extremity weakness and sensory deficits, it is less likely in this scenario given the patient's history of trauma and the focal nature of the symptoms.

Option E, conversion disorder, is a psychological condition characterized by physical symptoms without an identifiable organic cause. While the patient has a history of depression and anxiety, the objective findings of weakness and sensory deficits in the upper extremities make a conversion disorder less likely.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and history are consistent with a brachial plexopathy, likely resulting from the motor vehicle accident.",Success
A 62-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the last 15 years. Current medications include glyburide and amlodipine. The physician prescribes a medication that decreases the production of mevalonate. Which of the following changes to the serum is most likely to develop as an adverse effect of the prescribed drug?,A,"The correct answer is A. Increased creatine kinase concentration.

The medication that decreases the production of mevalonate is likely a statin, which is a type of cholesterol-lowering drug. Statins work by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is involved in the production of mevalonate, a precursor to cholesterol.

One of the potential adverse effects of statins is muscle damage, which can lead to an increase in creatine kinase (CK) concentration in the serum. Creatine kinase is an enzyme that is normally found in muscle cells, and elevated levels in the blood can indicate muscle damage or injury.

The other options are not directly related to the adverse effects of statins:

B. Decreased glucose concentration: Statins do not typically affect glucose levels.

C. Increased lactate concentration: Statins are not known to increase lactate levels.

D. Increased triglyceride concentration: While statins can affect lipid profiles, they typically decrease triglyceride levels, not increase them.

E. Increased bradykinin concentration: Statins do not affect bradykinin levels, which are involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and blood pressure regulation.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of smoking and diabetes may increase her risk for cardiovascular disease, which is why the physician may have prescribed a statin in the first place.",Success
"A 21-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of excess hair growth on her face. Menses occur irregularly at 45 to 65-day intervals. She is 159 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 23 kg/m2. Physical examination shows facial acne and growth of coarse dark hair on the face, chest, and lower back. Pelvic examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:
Sodium 141 mEq/L
Potassium 4.2 mEq/L
Glucose 109 mg/dL
Cortisol (1600 h) 4 μg/dL
Prolactin 14 ng/mL
17-hydroxyprogesterone 390 ng/dL (N=20–300 ng/dL)
Testosterone 91 ng/dL (N=8–60 ng/dL)
A urine pregnancy test is negative. This patient's condition is most likely associated with which of the following?""",E,"The correct answer is E. Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex.

The patient's symptoms, including excess hair growth on her face, irregular menses, facial acne, and growth of coarse dark hair on the face, chest, and lower back, are consistent with hirsutism. The laboratory results show elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (390 ng/dL), which is a precursor to cortisol and aldosterone production in the adrenal glands. This suggests that the patient has congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, which is the most common cause of CAH.

In CAH, the adrenal glands produce excessive amounts of androgens, including testosterone, which can cause hirsutism, acne, and irregular menses. The elevated level of testosterone (91 ng/dL) in this patient supports this diagnosis.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Hyperproliferation of theca interna cells is seen in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is a different condition characterized by ovarian cysts, insulin resistance, and androgen excess.

B. Exogenous anabolic steroid use would not explain the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, and there is no indication of steroid use in the question.

C. Compression of the infundibular stalk is related to hyperprolactinemia, which is not seen in this patient (prolactin level is 14 ng/mL, which is within normal limits).

D. Ovarian fibrosis and multiple cystic follicles are features of PCOS, which is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Therefore, the correct answer is E. Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex, which is consistent with congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.",Success
"A 64-year-old man with coronary artery disease and hypertension comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. His blood pressure ranged from 160/100 mm Hg to 150/94 mm Hg on his previous 3 visits over the past 4 months. Current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol. Three weeks ago, he was also started on amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 158/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. Renal duplex ultrasonography shows 90% occlusion of the right renal artery. Decreased renal blood flow is most likely to cause which of the following?",A,"The correct answer is A. Hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells.

Here's why:

The patient has a 90% occlusion of the right renal artery, which leads to decreased renal blood flow. This decrease in blood flow stimulates the juxtaglomerular cells to release renin, an enzyme that converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor that increases blood pressure. As a result, the juxtaglomerular cells undergo hyperplasia (an increase in cell number) to compensate for the decreased blood flow.

The other options are not directly related to decreased renal blood flow:

B. Dilation of efferent arteriole: Decreased renal blood flow would actually cause constriction of the efferent arteriole, not dilation.

C. Mesangial expansion and glomerular basement membrane thickening: These changes are characteristic of glomerulonephritis or glomerulosclerosis, not decreased renal blood flow.

D. Decreased prostaglandin synthesis by macula densa: Prostaglandins are vasodilators that help regulate renal blood flow. Decreased prostaglandin synthesis would actually worsen the decrease in renal blood flow, not be a direct result of it.

E. Decreased reabsorption of bicarbonate at proximal tubule: This is not a direct consequence of decreased renal blood flow. Bicarbonate reabsorption is primarily regulated by the proximal tubule's response to changes in pH and electrolyte balance.

In this scenario, the patient's hypertension is likely exacerbated by the decreased renal blood flow, which stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and increases blood pressure.",Success
"A 65-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband after he found her with nausea, headache, and agitation 1 hour ago. When he left their lakeside cabin 6 hours before to go ice fishing and get more firewood, she did not have any symptoms. She has chronic migraines, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her medications include lisinopril and metformin, but she ran out of her anti-hypertensive medications over the weekend. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 154/92 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. She is confused and oriented only to person and place. She recalls only one of three objects after 5 minutes. Her gait is unsteady. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's current condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

Based on the patient's symptoms, particularly the sudden onset of nausea, headache, and agitation, along with confusion and unsteady gait, the most likely diagnosis is carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. The fact that her husband left her alone in the lakeside cabin with a fire burning suggests a possible source of CO exposure.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the most effective intervention for CO poisoning. CO binds to hemoglobin with high affinity, displacing oxygen and leading to tissue hypoxia. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy accelerates the dissociation of CO from hemoglobin, reducing the half-life of carboxyhemoglobin and promoting oxygen delivery to tissues.

Intravenous nitroprusside (A) is not indicated for CO poisoning. Sumatriptan (B) is a medication used to treat migraines, but it is not effective in treating CO poisoning. 100% oxygen therapy (D) is often used as an initial treatment for CO poisoning, but it is not as effective as hyperbaric oxygen therapy in severe cases. Heliox therapy (E) is not indicated for CO poisoning.

It's worth noting that the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with CO poisoning, and the diagnosis should be confirmed with a carboxyhemoglobin level. However, based on the information provided, hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the most effective intervention.",Success
"A 62-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency room with severe substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, and nausea. Imaging reveals transmural myocardial infarction in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. Which of this patient's coronary arteries is most likely occluded?",E,"The correct answer is A. Left circumflex.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and imaging results suggest a posterior myocardial infarction (MI), which is typically supplied by the left circumflex (LCx) coronary artery. The posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum is a region that is usually perfused by the posterior descending artery (PDA), which is a branch of the LCx.

The LCx artery supplies the lateral and posterior walls of the left ventricle, including the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. Occlusion of the LCx artery can cause a posterior MI, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

The other options are not as likely:

B. Left anterior descending (LAD) artery: The LAD artery supplies the anterior wall of the left ventricle, not the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum.

C. Diagonal perforators: Diagonal perforators are small branches of the LAD artery that supply the anterior wall of the left ventricle, not the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum.

D. Septal perforators: Septal perforators are small branches of the LAD and LCx arteries that supply the septum, but they are not the primary suppliers of the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum.

E. Right main coronary artery: The right main coronary artery supplies the right ventricle and the inferior wall of the left ventricle, not the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum.

Current medical guidelines and evidence-based medicine support the association between the LCx artery and posterior MI. (Source: American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and European Society of Cardiology guidelines on myocardial infarction.)",Success
"A previously healthy, 24-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of loose, nonbloody stools. He also reports abdominal pain, intermittent nausea, and fever. He has not had vomiting, tenesmus, or rectal pain. His vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness of the right lower abdomen without rebound tenderness. Rectal exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 14,800/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 51 mm/h. Test of the stool for occult blood and stool studies for infection are negative. A CT scan of the abdomen shows mural thickening and surrounding fat stranding of discrete regions of the terminal ileum and transverse colon. A colonoscopy is performed and biopsy specimens of the affected areas of the colon are taken. Which of the following findings is most specific for this patient's condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Formation of noncaseating granulomas.

Based on the patient's symptoms and diagnostic results, the most likely diagnosis is Crohn's disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The CT scan findings of mural thickening and surrounding fat stranding of discrete regions of the terminal ileum and transverse colon are consistent with Crohn's disease.

Noncaseating granulomas are a characteristic histopathological feature of Crohn's disease. They are formed by aggregates of macrophages and other immune cells that attempt to contain the inflammation. The presence of noncaseating granulomas in biopsy specimens is a specific finding that supports the diagnosis of Crohn's disease.

Here's why the other options are not correct:

A. Neutrophilic inflammation of the crypts is a nonspecific finding that can be seen in various conditions, including infectious colitis and ulcerative colitis.

B. Neutrophil-rich pseudomembranes are characteristic of Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) colitis, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and diagnostic results.

D. Inflammation limited to the mucosa and submucosa is a feature of ulcerative colitis, which is another type of IBD. While it's possible that the patient has ulcerative colitis, the presence of noncaseating granulomas is more specific for Crohn's disease.

E. Presence of pseudopolyps is a feature of ulcerative colitis, not Crohn's disease.

It's essential to note that a definitive diagnosis of Crohn's disease requires a combination of clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings, as well as ruling out other conditions that may mimic its symptoms.",Success
"A 65-year-old man presents with pain in his left thigh for a week. He describes the pain as dull and constant, boring in nature, and localized deep below the thigh muscle. He says it is worse at night. Physical examination is significant for tenderness and warmth over the anterior aspect of the left thigh. A plain radiograph of the left femur shows increased cortical thickness with widened intercortical space. Laboratory studies show:
Alkaline phosphatase
925 U/L
Serum calcium
9.2 mg/dL
Serum phosphorus 4.4 mg/dL
Findings on bone biopsy are shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Osteitis deformans.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as dull and constant pain in the thigh, worsened at night, and physical examination findings of tenderness and warmth over the anterior aspect of the left thigh, suggest a bone lesion. The radiographic finding of increased cortical thickness with widened intercortical space on the plain radiograph of the left femur is also consistent with a bone lesion.

The laboratory studies show elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, which is a marker of bone turnover. The normal serum calcium and phosphorus levels rule out metabolic bone diseases such as hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism.

The bone biopsy image shows irregularly shaped bone trabeculae with a ""mosaic"" pattern, which is characteristic of Paget's disease, also known as osteitis deformans. This condition is a chronic bone disorder characterized by excessive bone resorption and formation, leading to deformities and pain.

Option A, osteomalacia, is a condition characterized by softening of the bones due to vitamin D deficiency or impaired mineralization. The radiographic findings and biopsy image do not support this diagnosis.

Option B, Ewing's sarcoma, is a type of bone cancer that typically affects children and young adults. The patient's age and the radiographic and biopsy findings do not support this diagnosis.

Option D, osteochondritis dissecans, is a condition that affects the joints, particularly the knee, ankle, and elbow. It is characterized by the separation of a piece of cartilage and bone from the joint surface. The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings do not support this diagnosis.

Option E, osteitis fibrosa cystica, is a condition characterized by the formation of cysts and fibrous tissue in the bone, typically seen in patients with hyperparathyroidism. The normal serum calcium and phosphorus levels rule out this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, radiographic findings, laboratory studies, and biopsy image, the most likely diagnosis is osteitis deformans (Paget's disease).",Success
"A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of severe abdominal pain and vomiting for 8 hours. He has had around 3–4 episodes of greenish colored vomit during this period.

His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 87/min, and blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg. He is diagnosed with acute appendicitis and is taken to the operating room for an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy. The appendix is gangrenous and perforated with purulent fluid in the pelvis. Just after the appendiceal base is ligated, the patient shows muscle rigidity and profuse diaphoresis. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 146/70 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. The end-tidal CO2 is 85 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Dantrolene.

The patient is experiencing symptoms of malignant hyperthermia (MH), a rare but life-threatening medical emergency. The signs and symptoms of MH include:

* Muscle rigidity
* Profuse sweating (diaphoresis)
* Hyperthermia (elevated body temperature)
* Tachycardia (rapid heart rate)
* Hypertension
* Increased end-tidal CO2

The patient's history of taking haloperidol, a neuroleptic medication, increases the risk of developing MH. The trigger for MH in this case is likely the anesthesia used during the laparoscopic appendectomy.

Dantrolene is the specific treatment for malignant hyperthermia. It works by inhibiting the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which helps to reduce muscle contraction and heat production. Dantrolene is administered intravenously, and it is essential to administer it promptly to prevent further complications.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that may be used to treat hypertension or tachycardia, but it is not specific to treating malignant hyperthermia.

C. Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that may be used to treat Parkinson's disease or hyperprolactinemia, but it is not related to the treatment of malignant hyperthermia.

D. Cyproheptadine is an antihistamine that may be used to treat allergic reactions or serotonin syndrome, but it is not related to the treatment of malignant hyperthermia.

E. Surgical embolectomy is a procedure used to remove blood clots from blood vessels, which is not relevant to the treatment of malignant hyperthermia.

In summary, dantrolene is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition, malignant hyperthermia, due to its specific mechanism of action and established efficacy in treating this life-threatening emergency.",Success
"After a T cell progenitor leaves the bone marrow, most of its development takes place in the thymus. It passes through several stages during its maturation. Positive selection is an important process during maturation of T lymphocytes, and it ensures the preservation of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T cells. During which of the following developmental stages does a T cell undergo this process?",C,"The correct answer is C. Double-positive T cell.

Here's why:

Positive selection is a critical process during T cell maturation in the thymus, where T cells that recognize self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are selected to survive and mature. This process ensures that T cells are able to recognize and respond to antigens presented by self-MHC molecules.

The developmental stages of T cell maturation in the thymus are as follows:

1. Double-negative (DN) pro-T cell: This is the earliest stage, where T cell progenitors enter the thymus and begin to express T cell receptors (TCRs).
2. Pre-T cell: At this stage, T cells start to express CD2 and CD7, but not yet CD4 or CD8.
3. Double-positive (DP) T cell: Here, T cells express both CD4 and CD8, and undergo positive selection. This is the stage where T cells that recognize self-MHC molecules are selected to survive and mature.
4. Single-positive (SP) CD4+ or CD8+ T cell: After positive selection, T cells that have recognized self-MHC molecules undergo negative selection, where those that recognize self-antigens are eliminated. The surviving T cells then mature into either CD4+ or CD8+ single-positive T cells.

Therefore, positive selection occurs during the double-positive T cell stage (option C), where T cells that recognize self-MHC molecules are selected to survive and mature.

The other options are incorrect because:

A. Double-negative pro-T cell: This is an earlier stage, before positive selection occurs.

B. Pre-T cell: This stage occurs before the expression of CD4 and CD8, and positive selection has not yet taken place.

D. Single-positive CD4+ T cell: This is a later stage, after positive and negative selection have occurred.

E. Single-positive CD8+ T cell: Similar to option D, this is a later stage, after positive and negative selection have occurred.",Success

He had to take a leave from his army instructor duties as he was not able to handle the familiar settings of practice shooting ranges and sudden loud explosions during battalion training. After refusing to leave his house, he was finally persuaded by his wife to visit your clinic. What is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including upsetting dreams, anxiety, and disturbing flashbacks, are consistent with the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. The patient's history of experiencing traumatic events during his time in Iraq, followed by a delayed onset of symptoms 7 weeks after returning home, is also consistent with PTSD.

The patient's symptoms are not limited to anxiety or fear of loud noises, but rather a complex set of symptoms that include:

* Intrusive symptoms (flashbacks, nightmares)
* Avoidance symptoms (avoiding familiar settings, such as practice shooting ranges)
* Hyperarousal symptoms (intense fear of loud noises)
* Changes in cognition and mood (feeling anxious, unable to handle familiar settings)

These symptoms are characteristic of PTSD, which is a psychiatric disorder that can occur in individuals who have experienced a traumatic event.

Acute stress disorder (Option A) is a possible diagnosis, but it typically occurs within days or weeks of the traumatic event, and the patient's symptoms have persisted for 7 weeks.

Performance anxiety (Option B) is not a likely diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms are not limited to anxiety related to a specific performance or situation.

Schizophrenia (Option C) is not a likely diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms do not include hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized thinking and behavior, which are characteristic of schizophrenia.

Panic attack (Option E) is not a likely diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms are not limited to a single episode of intense fear or discomfort, but rather a complex set of symptoms that have persisted over time.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), PTSD is diagnosed when an individual experiences a traumatic event, followed by symptoms that last for more than 1 month and cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning. The patient's symptoms meet these criteria, making PTSD the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A patient with a1-antitrypsin deficiency is warned by his physician that his increasing dyspnea may be worsened by his continued cigarette smoking. Which of the following factors, released by both neutrophils and alveolar macrophages, is responsible for the patient's condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Elastase.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and liver. Alpha-1 antitrypsin is a protein that inhibits the activity of elastase, a proteolytic enzyme released by neutrophils and alveolar macrophages. Elastase breaks down elastin, a protein that provides elasticity to lung tissue. In the absence of sufficient alpha-1 antitrypsin, elastase is not adequately inhibited, leading to the degradation of elastin and the development of emphysema.

Cigarette smoking worsens the condition by increasing the influx of neutrophils and macrophages into the lungs, which in turn release more elastase, further exacerbating the damage to lung tissue.

The other options are not directly related to the pathophysiology of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency:

A. Major Basic Protein is a protein released by eosinophils, not neutrophils or macrophages, and is involved in parasitic infections and allergic reactions.

B. Antibodies against alpha-3 segment of collagen IV (COL4A3) are associated with Goodpasture's syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the kidneys and lungs.

C. Mucus is a thick, protective substance produced by the respiratory tract, but it is not directly related to the pathophysiology of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

D. Surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins that reduces surface tension in the alveoli, facilitating gas exchange. While surfactant dysfunction can contribute to respiratory distress, it is not directly related to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.",Success
"A 54-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 1 year ago. His only medication is metformin. His serum glucose is 186 mg/dL and his hemoglobin A1c is 7.6%. The physician prescribes an additional antidiabetic drug and counsels the patient on its delayed onset of action. At a follow-up appointment 4 weeks later, the patient reports that his home blood glucose readings have improved. He also mentions that he has had a weight gain of 4 kg (8.8 lb). The patient has most likely been treated with which of the following drugs?",C,"The correct answer is C. Rosiglitazone.

Here's why:

* The patient's hemoglobin A1c is 7.6%, indicating that their diabetes is not well-controlled with metformin alone. The physician adds a second medication to improve glucose control.
* The patient reports improved home blood glucose readings at the 4-week follow-up, suggesting that the additional medication is effective.
* The patient also mentions a weight gain of 4 kg (8.8 lb), which is a common side effect of thiazolidinediones, a class of medications that includes rosiglitazone.

Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that improves insulin sensitivity, leading to improved glucose control. It is known to have a delayed onset of action, taking several weeks to reach its full effect. Weight gain is a common side effect of rosiglitazone, which is consistent with the patient's report.

In contrast, the other options are less likely:

* Empagliflozin (A) is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which typically causes weight loss, not gain.
* Liraglutide (B) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, which also typically causes weight loss.
* Glyburide (D) is a sulfonylurea, which can cause weight gain, but it is not known for its delayed onset of action.
* Sitagliptin (E) is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which is weight-neutral and does not typically cause significant weight gain.

Therefore, based on the patient's response to the additional medication and the reported side effect of weight gain, rosiglitazone is the most likely correct answer.",Success

At the emergency department, she is alert and oriented and is noted to be anorexic. The patient fervently denies being underweight claiming that she is ‘a fatty’ and goes on to refuse any further intravenous fluid and later, even the hospital meals. Which of the following is the best option for long-term management of this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Cognitive-behavioral therapy.

The patient's symptoms and behavior are consistent with anorexia nervosa, a serious eating disorder characterized by a distorted body image and an intense fear of gaining weight. The patient's denial of being underweight, refusal of fluids and meals, and obsessive behavior during cheerleading practice suggest a strong psychological component to her condition.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a recommended treatment approach for anorexia nervosa, as it helps patients identify and challenge negative thought patterns and behaviors associated with the disorder. CBT can be effective in improving eating habits, reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, and promoting a healthier body image.

While in-patient medical therapy (Option B) may be necessary in severe cases of anorexia nervosa, it is not the best long-term management option for this patient. In-patient psychiatric therapy (Option C) may also be beneficial, but CBT is a more targeted and evidence-based approach for treating anorexia nervosa.

Antidepressants (Option D) may be used to treat co-occurring depression or anxiety, but they are not a primary treatment for anorexia nervosa. Appetite stimulants (Option E) are not a recommended treatment for anorexia nervosa, as they may exacerbate the underlying psychological issues driving the patient's behavior.

A 45-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He was diagnosed with HIV 15 years ago. He was taking triple antiretroviral therapy but stopped a few months ago because he was feeling well. He lives in Wyoming. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 47/mm3 (N ≥ 500). The patient currently refuses to restart antiretroviral therapy. Which of the following medication regimens is most appropriate at this time?,D,"The correct answer is D. Trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin.

Justification:

The patient has a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (47/mm3), which indicates immunosuppression. With a history of HIV infection and refusal to restart antiretroviral therapy, the patient is at risk of developing opportunistic infections. The goal is to prevent these infections.

Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (A) are effective against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients. However, this option is incomplete, as it does not cover other potential infections.

Azithromycin and itraconazole (B) are effective against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and fungal infections, respectively. However, this combination does not provide coverage against PCP.

Azithromycin and amphotericin B (C) are not a suitable combination, as amphotericin B is typically used for severe fungal infections, and its use is not justified in this scenario.

Dapsone, pyrimethamine, itraconazole, and azithromycin (E) is an overly broad regimen that includes medications for PCP, toxoplasmosis, and fungal infections. While it covers multiple bases, it is not the most appropriate choice, as it may increase the risk of adverse effects and drug interactions.

The correct answer, D. Trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin, provides coverage against PCP, MAC, and other bacterial infections, making it the most appropriate regimen for this patient at this time.

Note: According to current guidelines, restarting antiretroviral therapy is essential for this patient. However, since the patient refuses, the focus is on preventing opportunistic infections.",Success
"A 32-year-old male presents to the emergency department because of fever and diarrhea. He was in his normal state of health until 2 weeks ago when he went abroad on a vacation. During his trip he went kayaking, visited spas, interacted with local animals, and ate local foods. Since returning he has had 3-day history of fever, cough, headache, and diarrhea. He drinks socially and has a 15-pack-year history of smoking. On presentation his temperature is 102.3°F (39.1°C), blood pressure is 105/62 mmHg, pulse is 91/min, respirations are 18/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Chest exam reveals fine crackles on auscultation. Chest radiograph reveals patchy infiltrates in both lungs and labs reveal mild hyponatremia and mild elevation of AST/ALT levels. The organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following characteristics?",E,"The correct answer is A. Can form an endospore.

Based on the patient's symptoms and travel history, the most likely diagnosis is Legionnaires' disease, a type of pneumonia caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila. Legionella is a gram-negative rod that can form an endospore, which allows it to survive in water and soil for extended periods.

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, cough, headache, and diarrhea, are consistent with Legionnaires' disease. The chest radiograph findings of patchy infiltrates in both lungs also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of visiting spas and interacting with local water sources (kayaking) increases the likelihood of exposure to Legionella-contaminated water.

The other options are not associated with Legionella:

B. Has a rabbit reservoir: This characteristic is associated with Leptospirosis, not Legionnaires' disease.

C. Has no cell wall: This characteristic is associated with Mycoplasma, not Legionnaires' disease.

D. Is more common in parrot owners: This characteristic is associated with Chlamydophila psittaci, which causes psittacosis, not Legionnaires' disease.

E. Is transmitted by air conditioning: While Legionella can be transmitted through contaminated water systems, including air conditioning systems, this is not a characteristic unique to the organism.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), support the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease based on the patient's symptoms and exposure history.",Success
"A 14-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with hand pain after falling from his skateboard one day ago. He reports that he lost his balance while attempting a new trick and fell on his outstretched hands. He has been icing his hand and taking several tablets of ibuprofen every few hours, but the pain and swelling have not improved. The patient reports that he has not been able to use the hand to take notes in school. His past medical history is significant for infectious mononucleosis last year and type 1 diabetes mellitus for which he has an insulin pump. On physical exam, there is mild swelling over the dorsal aspect of the hand and wrist. He has tenderness in the region between the extensor pollicus longus and the extensor pollicus brevis of the right hand.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Radiograph of the wrist.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest a possible fracture or injury to the wrist or hand, particularly in the region between the extensor pollicus longus and extensor pollicus brevis, which is a common location for a fracture of the scaphoid bone. The patient's inability to use his hand and the persistence of pain and swelling despite icing and taking ibuprofen suggest that the injury may be more severe than a simple sprain.

A radiograph (X-ray) of the wrist is the best next step in management because it is a non-invasive, widely available, and cost-effective imaging modality that can help diagnose or rule out a fracture, particularly a scaphoid fracture. The American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria recommend radiographs as the initial imaging study for suspected wrist fractures.

Reassurance and pain management (Option A) may not be sufficient, as the patient's symptoms persist despite self-care measures, and a more serious underlying condition may need to be addressed.

MRI of the wrist (Option C) may be useful for evaluating soft tissue injuries or detecting occult fractures, but it is not the best initial test in this scenario. MRI is typically reserved for cases where the radiograph is negative or equivocal, or when there is a high suspicion of a ligamentous injury.

Thumb spica cast (Option D) or radial gutter cast (Option E) may be treatment options for a confirmed fracture, but they are not the next step in management before a diagnosis is established.

In summary, a radiograph of the wrist is the best next step in management to evaluate the patient's symptoms and determine the presence or absence of a fracture.",Success
"A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of irregular menstrual bleeding. Menses have occurred at 45- to 90-day intervals since menarche at the age of 15 years. Her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. The patient reports that she was too embarrassed to discuss this issue with anyone until now. Over the past two years, she was unable to become pregnant despite having unprotected sexual intercourse with her husband on a regular basis. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 85 kg (187 lb); BMI is 29.4 kg/m2. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows oily skin and severe facial acne. There is abnormal pigmented hair on the upper lip and around both nipples. The patient wishes to have children. In addition to recommending lifestyle modifications, which of the following is the most appropriate step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Clomiphene therapy.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common endocrine disorder characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, infertility, and signs of androgen excess (acne, oily skin, and hirsutism). The patient's BMI is also elevated, which is common in PCOS.

Clomiphene citrate is an oral ovulation inducer that is commonly used as a first-line treatment for infertility in women with PCOS. It works by stimulating ovulation and increasing the chances of conception. Clomiphene is recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Endocrine Society as a primary treatment for ovulation induction in women with PCOS.

In vitro fertilization (IVF) with the patient's egg (Option A) may be considered in the future if clomiphene therapy is unsuccessful, but it is not the most appropriate initial step in management.

Progesterone therapy (Option B) may be used to induce a withdrawal bleed in women with PCOS who have irregular menstrual cycles, but it is not a treatment for infertility.

Bromocriptine therapy (Option C) is used to treat hyperprolactinemia, which is not indicated in this patient.

Leuprolide therapy (Option E) is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist that is used to treat conditions such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids, but it is not a treatment for PCOS or infertility.

Lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss and exercise, are also important in the management of PCOS, but clomiphene therapy is the most appropriate next step in this patient's care.",Success
"A 56-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of nausea and shortness of breath that started while he was at work one hour ago. He also reports lightheadedness that started earlier in the day. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, for which he takes metformin and sitagliptin. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. He appears pale and diaphoretic. A 12-lead ECG is shown. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?",C,"The correct answer is C. Acute inferior myocardial infarction.

The 12-lead ECG is not provided, but based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, an acute inferior myocardial infarction is the most likely underlying cause. The patient's symptoms of nausea, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness are consistent with cardiac ischemia. The patient's pale and diaphoretic appearance also suggests a cardiovascular emergency.

The ECG findings that would support this diagnosis include:

* ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, which are the leads that correspond to the inferior wall of the heart.
* Reciprocal ST-segment depression in leads I and aVL, which is a common finding in inferior myocardial infarction.

The other options are less likely based on the patient's symptoms and medical history:

* A. Viral myocarditis is unlikely to cause the patient's symptoms, especially the shortness of breath and lightheadedness. Myocarditis typically presents with chest pain, fever, and ECG changes that are not specific to a particular region of the heart.
* B. Acute pericarditis typically presents with chest pain that is relieved by sitting up and worsened by lying down, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. The ECG changes in pericarditis are also different from those seen in myocardial infarction.
* D. Saddle pulmonary embolus is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with cardiac ischemia than pulmonary embolism. The ECG changes in pulmonary embolism are also different from those seen in myocardial infarction.
* E. Second-degree AV block is a conduction abnormality that is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. It may be seen in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction, but it is not the primary cause of the patient's symptoms.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, an acute inferior myocardial infarction is the most likely underlying cause of his symptoms.",Success
"A 27-year-old man with a history of cocaine abuse comes to the physician 2 weeks after undergoing successful arthroscopic repair of a torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee. There were no complications. He was discharged with prescriptions for oxycodone and acetaminophen. He complains of severe pain that prevents him from participating in physical therapy and wakes him from sleep. Physical examination of the left knee shows a healing incision; there is no joint effusion, erythema, or evidence of wound dehiscence, and his gait is normal. When the physician recommends switching to ibuprofen for pain, he becomes visibly angry and demands a refill of oxycodone. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient's request?",B,"The correct answer is B. Request further information about which drugs he has taken recently and in the past.

This patient's behavior, such as becoming visibly angry and demanding a refill of oxycodone, raises concerns about potential opioid misuse or addiction. Given his history of cocaine abuse, it's essential to assess his current substance use and risk of opioid addiction.

Requesting further information about his recent and past drug use (Option B) is the most appropriate response. This will help the physician to:

1. Identify any potential red flags for opioid misuse or addiction.
2. Assess the patient's risk of developing opioid use disorder.
3. Develop a more informed plan for pain management that takes into account the patient's substance use history.

Option A is incorrect because prescribing a long-acting opioid without a thorough assessment of the patient's substance use history and risk of addiction is not recommended.

Option C, requesting consent for a urine test, may be a part of the assessment process, but it's not the most appropriate initial response.

Option D, prescribing a short course of oxycodone, may not address the underlying concerns about opioid misuse and may even enable the patient's addiction.

Option E, referring to a substance use counselor, may be a necessary step in the patient's care, but it's not the most immediate response to the patient's request for a refill.

By requesting further information about the patient's drug use history, the physician can make a more informed decision about the patient's pain management and potential need for addiction counseling or treatment.",Success
"An 89-year-old woman sees her neurologist for a follow-up evaluation. Three months ago, she presented with complaints about facial asymmetry. Her daughter has noticed that her mother’s mouth is droops downwards on the right side of her face and that she cannot close her right eye well. The same side also lacks wrinkles on the forehead. Since then, the patient feels like her facial muscles have gotten weaker. She was given a course of corticosteroids, but she has still not recovered fully. Upon being asked to close her eyes, the patient has difficulty doing so and fails to completely close her eyelids. On examination, there is no loss of pain, temperature, or crude or tactile touch sensations in the whole face. The neurological exam is otherwise unremarkable. This patient also has type 2 diabetes mellitus which is well controlled with metformin. The neurologist recommends a therapy that will help relieve her symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely treatment option being prescribed to this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Botox.

The patient's symptoms, including facial asymmetry, drooping of the mouth on the right side, inability to close the right eye, and lack of wrinkles on the forehead, are consistent with a diagnosis of Bell's palsy, a condition that affects the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). The patient's failure to recover fully after a course of corticosteroids suggests that additional therapy is needed to relieve her symptoms.

Botox (botulinum toxin) is a treatment option for Bell's palsy, particularly for patients who have not responded to corticosteroids. Botox can help relax the affected facial muscles, reducing symptoms such as facial weakness, drooping, and eyelid closure difficulties. While Botox is more commonly associated with cosmetic uses, it has been shown to be effective in treating certain neurological conditions, including Bell's palsy.

The other options are not directly related to the treatment of Bell's palsy:

B. Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant medication, which is not typically used to treat Bell's palsy.

C. Vitamin B12 is essential for nerve function, but a deficiency is not directly related to Bell's palsy.

D. Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid, which the patient has already received without full recovery.

E. Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic, which is not indicated for the treatment of Bell's palsy.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms and the need for additional therapy, Botox is the most likely treatment option being prescribed to this patient.",Success
"A 28-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of fever, chills, and generalized weakness. He has no cough. He was treated for a neck abscess 6 months ago.

Transthoracic echocardiography shows multiple vegetations on the tricuspid valve and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Two sets of blood cultures are collected. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Intravenous vancomycin therapy.

This patient presents with a high fever, chills, and generalized weakness, which are indicative of a severe infection. The presence of track marks on both cubital fossae and a history of intravenous drug use suggest that the patient is at high risk for infective endocarditis (IE). The transthoracic echocardiography results showing multiple vegetations on the tricuspid valve and moderate tricuspid regurgitation further support this diagnosis.

The American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend that patients with suspected IE should receive empiric antibiotic therapy as soon as possible, pending blood culture results. Vancomycin is a suitable choice for empiric therapy in this case, as it provides broad-spectrum coverage against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is a common pathogen in IE.

While transesophageal echocardiography (A) may provide more detailed information about the extent of the valvular damage, it is not the most appropriate next step in management. The patient requires immediate antibiotic therapy to treat the underlying infection.

A chest X-ray (C) may be useful in evaluating for potential complications such as septic emboli, but it is not a priority at this point.

A CT pulmonary angiogram (D) is not indicated in this scenario, as there is no suspicion of pulmonary embolism.

Ciprofloxacin (E) is not a suitable choice for empiric therapy in this case, as it does not provide adequate coverage against MRSA and other gram-positive bacteria that are commonly associated with IE.

In summary, the most appropriate next step in management is to initiate intravenous vancomycin therapy to treat the suspected IE.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician because of persistent fatigue for the past 4 months. She has no history of major medical illness. Her temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 121/min, and blood pressure is 120/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae. A peripheral blood smear is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Iron deficiency.

The patient's symptoms of persistent fatigue, pale conjunctivae, and peripheral blood smear findings are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. The blood smear shows microcytic and hypochromic red blood cells, which are characteristic of iron deficiency anemia.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

A. Hereditary spherocytosis: This is a genetic disorder that affects the red blood cell membrane, leading to spherocytosis (abnormally shaped red blood cells). While it can cause anemia, the blood smear would show spherocytes, which are not described in this scenario.

B. Vitamin B12 deficiency: This can cause megaloblastic anemia, characterized by large, immature red blood cells. The blood smear would show macrocytes, not microcytes, and the patient's symptoms would likely include neurological manifestations, such as numbness or tingling in the hands and feet.

C. Pyruvate kinase deficiency: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the enzyme pyruvate kinase, involved in glycolysis. It can cause hemolytic anemia, but the blood smear would show abnormal red blood cell morphology, such as echinocytes or bite cells, which are not described in this scenario.

E. β-thalassemia minor: This is a genetic disorder that affects hemoglobin production, leading to microcytic anemia. While it can cause fatigue, the blood smear would show target cells, which are not described in this scenario.

"A 40-year old man presents to the clinic with vague upper abdominal pain that has been worsening for the last several days. He says that he often gets similar pain but less severe and that it worsens with meals. The pain sometimes radiates to his back. He recently lost 15 kg (33.6 lb) of weight secondary to his lack of appetite since his last visit 2 months ago. He admits to drinking alcohol almost every night since the age of 17. His temperature is 37.0° C (98.6°F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals moderate epigastric tenderness. An abdominal CT scan reveals calcifications as shown by the white arrows. Which of the following organs is affected in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Pancreas.

The abdominal CT scan shows calcifications in the pancreas, which is a characteristic finding in chronic pancreatitis. The patient's symptoms, such as worsening upper abdominal pain that radiates to the back, weight loss, and lack of appetite, are also consistent with chronic pancreatitis. The patient's history of long-term alcohol abuse is a strong risk factor for developing chronic pancreatitis.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings:

B. Jejunum: The jejunum is a part of the small intestine, and calcifications in this area would not typically cause the symptoms described.

C. Duodenum: The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine, and calcifications in this area would not typically cause the symptoms described.

D. Large intestine: The large intestine (colon) is not typically associated with calcifications, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a large intestine disorder.

E. Gallbladder: While the gallbladder can be affected by calcifications (gallstones), the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are not consistent with a gallbladder disorder.

According to the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) guidelines, chronic pancreatitis is a common complication of long-term alcohol abuse, and CT scans are useful in diagnosing the condition. The guidelines recommend that patients with chronic pancreatitis be managed with pain control, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, and lifestyle modifications, including abstinence from alcohol.",Success
"A 36-year-old man presents to his physician for a regular checkup, and he expresses an intent to quit smoking. He is a financial director with a 15-pack-year history of smoking who tried quitting several times. He tried different nicotine replacement products, none of which helped him. The patient has gastrointestinal reflux disease and takes omeprazole. The medical history is significant for a head trauma after which he had two seizure episodes. He does not have a history of any other disorders. Currently, he is not on any antiepileptic medication. He heard from his friend about an antidepressant that efficiently helps with smoking cessation. He would like to try this medication, and asks his physician for an advice. Which of the following statements regarding the use of the mentioned medication is correct?",C,"The correct answer is C. Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and it should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder.

Bupropion is an antidepressant that has been shown to be effective in smoking cessation. However, it has a significant contraindication: it lowers the seizure threshold, making it unsuitable for patients with a history of seizure disorders. In this case, the patient has a history of head trauma and two seizure episodes, which makes bupropion a contraindicated medication for him.

Option A is incorrect because omeprazole does not interfere with bupropion metabolism, and there is no need to adjust the timing of taking these medications.

Option B is incorrect because bupropion can be used as a single agent for smoking cessation, and it does not require the use of nicotine replacement products.

Option D is incorrect because while bupropion may have cardiac side effects, a full cardiac workup is not necessary before prescribing it for smoking cessation.

Option E is incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, the patient's history of seizure disorder is a contraindication for bupropion use.

It's essential to note that the patient's physician should discuss alternative smoking cessation options with him, such as varenicline or counseling, which may be more suitable for his medical history.",Success
"A 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 0, at 22 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department for abdominal pain and heavy vaginal bleeding for 2 hours. She has had no prenatal care.

The uterus is consistent in size with a 20-week gestation. There is blood on the vulva, introitus, and medial aspect of the thighs. Ultrasound shows complete detachment of the placenta from the uterus. Fetal heart tones are absent. An emergent cesarean delivery is performed. Following the procedure, the patient becomes tearful and distraught. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial response by the physician?",A,"The correct answer is A. ""I'm sorry for your loss. This must be a difficult situation for you.""

This response is the most appropriate initial response by the physician for several reasons:

1. Acknowledgment of loss: The physician acknowledges the patient's loss, which is essential in validating her emotions and showing empathy.
2. Empathy: The phrase ""This must be a difficult situation for you"" conveys understanding and compassion, allowing the patient to feel heard and understood.
3. Non-judgmental: This response does not make assumptions or offer unsolicited advice, which can come across as insensitive or dismissive.
4. Open-ended: The response encourages the patient to express her feelings and thoughts, allowing for a more personalized and supportive conversation.

The other options are not ideal for the following reasons:

B. This response minimizes the patient's loss and implies that the next pregnancy will be successful, which may not be the case.

C. While this response acknowledges the loss, it shifts the focus too quickly to ""moving forward,"" which may not be what the patient is ready to discuss.

D. This response comes across as insensitive and dismissive, implying that the physician has seen many similar cases and that the patient will simply ""get through it.""

E. While offering support and resources is important, prescribing medication for anxiety and grief without a thorough assessment and discussion may not be appropriate at this initial stage.

Peripheral blood smear shows red blood cells with increased zones of central pallor and anisocytosis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is E. Iron deficiency.

Here's a breakdown of the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings that support this diagnosis:

1. Fatigue and headache: These are common symptoms of anemia, which can be caused by iron deficiency.
2. Abdominal pain: This could be related to the patient's history of ibuprofen use, which can cause gastrointestinal irritation and bleeding, leading to iron deficiency.
3. Pallor: The patient's conjunctival and mucosal pallor suggest anemia.
4. Peripheral blood smear: The presence of red blood cells with increased zones of central pallor (hypochromia) and anisocytosis (variation in red blood cell size) is consistent with iron deficiency anemia.
5. Dietary history: The patient's diet, which consists mainly of potatoes and lean meats, is deficient in iron-rich foods such as red meat, poultry, and fish.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following:

A. Folic acid deficiency: While folic acid deficiency can cause anemia, it is less likely in this patient, as the peripheral blood smear does not show the characteristic features of megaloblastic anemia, such as macrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils.

B. Intravascular hemolysis: This is unlikely, as there is no evidence of jaundice, dark urine, or a history of hemolytic anemia.

C. Impaired erythropoietin production: This is unlikely, as the patient's kidney function is not mentioned to be impaired, and there is no history of chronic kidney disease, which can lead to impaired erythropoietin production.

D. Vitamin B12 deficiency: While vitamin B12 deficiency can cause anemia, the peripheral blood smear would typically show macrocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils, which are not mentioned in this case.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with iron deficiency anemia, making option E the most likely underlying cause of his symptoms.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. Her younger brother has mild developmental delay, pale complexion, and has to limit his dietary intake of phenylalanine. She has no similar symptoms and is in good health. Her parents are healthy. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother?",A,"The correct answer is A. 67%.

The patient's brother has phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is necessary for the breakdown of phenylalanine, an amino acid found in many protein-rich foods.

As the patient's brother has PKU, we can assume that he is homozygous for the mutated gene (i.e., he has two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent). Since the patient's parents are healthy, they are likely carriers of the mutated gene, meaning they have one normal copy and one mutated copy of the gene.

The patient's risk of being a carrier of the mutated gene can be calculated using the principles of Mendelian inheritance. As the patient's parents are carriers, each has a 50% chance of passing on the mutated gene to their offspring. Since the patient has no symptoms, she is likely not homozygous for the mutated gene (i.e., she doesn't have two copies of the mutated gene). Therefore, her risk of being a carrier is the same as the probability that she inherited the mutated gene from one of her parents.

Using the Punnett square, we can calculate the probability of the patient being a carrier as follows:

* The patient inherits the mutated gene from her mother: 50% (since her mother is a carrier)
* The patient inherits the mutated gene from her father: 50% (since her father is a carrier)
* The patient is a carrier (inherits the mutated gene from either parent): 50% + 50% = 100%
* However, since the patient can inherit the mutated gene from either parent, we need to subtract the probability of inheriting the mutated gene from both parents (which would make her homozygous, not a carrier): 100% - 25% ( probability of inheriting the mutated gene from both parents) = 75%

So, the patient has a 75% chance of being a carrier. However, since the question asks for the most appropriate assessment, and 75% is not an option, we need to consider the closest option. In this case, the closest option is 67%, which is a reasonable approximation of the patient's carrier risk.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. 67%.",Success
"A 23-year-old man presents with swelling of the left knee. He noticed the swelling a day ago while preparing for the college basketball game. He has had approximately 10 different sexual partners in the past 3 months. Synovial fluid tap shows a WBC count of 90,000 cells/mm3. What is the mechanism of action of the drug which is indicated for the treatment of this patient’s most likely condition?",B,"The correct answer is C. Neutrophil migration inhibitor.

Based on the patient's symptoms, particularly the swelling of the left knee and the high WBC count in the synovial fluid, the most likely diagnosis is gonococcal arthritis, which is a complication of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. The patient's history of multiple sexual partners in the past 3 months supports this diagnosis.

The treatment of choice for gonococcal arthritis is ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin. However, the question is asking about the mechanism of action of the drug indicated for this condition.

In gonococcal arthritis, the infection triggers an inflammatory response, leading to the migration of neutrophils into the joint space. The drug of choice for treating this condition is often a corticosteroid, such as prednisone, in addition to antibiotics. Corticosteroids work by inhibiting the migration of neutrophils to the site of inflammation, thereby reducing the inflammatory response and alleviating symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Neutrophil migration inhibitor, which describes the mechanism of action of corticosteroids in treating gonococcal arthritis.",Success
Which of the following patient presentations seen in a pediatric immunology clinic is most consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia?,D,"The correct answer is D. A 9-month-old boy who has had recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia in the past three months.

Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, also known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by the absence or marked decrease of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the blood. It is caused by a mutation in the BTK (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) gene, which is essential for B-cell development.

The presentation that is most consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is option D: a 9-month-old boy who has had recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia in the past three months. This is because:

* Recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia are common infections seen in patients with XLA, due to their inability to produce antibodies against encapsulated bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae.
* The age of presentation is consistent with XLA, which typically becomes apparent in infancy or early childhood, often around 6-9 months of age.
* The other options do not fit the typical presentation of XLA:
	+ Option A suggests a diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia, which is a different primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by progressive neurologic symptoms, telangiectasias, and recurrent infections.
	+ Option B suggests a diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome, which is a congenital disorder characterized by hypocalcemia, immunodeficiency, and cardiac defects.
	+ Option C suggests a diagnosis of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, which is often seen in patients with defects in cell-mediated immunity, such as autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1).
	+ Option E suggests a diagnosis of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections.

In summary, the presentation of recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia in a 9-month-old boy is most consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia.",Success
"A 29-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by a concerned neighbor. The patient appears disheveled, has a flat affect, and appears to be having auditory hallucinations. He is alert and oriented to time, person, and place and has an intact long-term and short-term memory. His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions. Which of the following is a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Affective symptoms.

Based on the patient's symptoms, it appears that he is experiencing a psychotic episode, likely due to an underlying psychiatric condition such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. The patient's sudden change in behavior, flat affect, auditory hallucinations, and grandiose delusions (boasting about himself and suggesting changes to the committee) are all indicative of a psychotic episode.

Affective symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, or mood swings, are often associated with a better prognosis in patients with psychotic disorders. This is because affective symptoms are more responsive to treatment and are often indicative of a more treatable underlying condition.

In contrast, negative symptoms (option E), such as flat affect, social withdrawal, and apathy, are often associated with a poorer prognosis, as they can be more resistant to treatment and may indicate a more severe underlying condition.

Slow onset (option B) is not a predictor of good prognosis, as it can indicate a more insidious and chronic underlying condition.

Being single (option C) is not a relevant predictor of prognosis in this context.

Male sex (option D) is also not a predictor of good prognosis, as the prognosis of psychotic disorders is not significantly influenced by gender.

It's worth noting that a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough medical and psychiatric history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, would be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and to develop an appropriate treatment plan.",Success
A 23-year-old man comes to the clinic for yellowing of his eyes. The patient has been relatively healthy and just recently started “intermittent fasting” to try to lose weight. He recalls a similar episode 4 years ago when he was recovering from an emergency appendectomy. The patient denies smoking but endorses an episode of binge drinking 2 days ago. He is sexually active with both men and women. His physical examination is unremarkable besides scleral icterus. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s symptoms?,C,"The correct answer is C. Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase.

The patient's symptoms, specifically the yellowing of his eyes (scleral icterus), suggest jaundice, which can be caused by elevated bilirubin levels. The patient's history of intermittent fasting, binge drinking, and previous episode of jaundice after an appendectomy are clues to the diagnosis.

The most likely explanation is Gilbert's syndrome, a benign condition characterized by decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, an enzyme involved in bilirubin metabolism. This leads to impaired conjugation of bilirubin, resulting in elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin, which can cause jaundice.

The patient's history of intermittent fasting and binge drinking may have triggered the episode of jaundice, as these activities can increase bilirubin production and reduce UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity. The previous episode of jaundice after an appendectomy suggests that the patient may have a underlying predisposition to Gilbert's syndrome.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and history:

A. Autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of biliary tract (primary sclerosing cholangitis) would likely present with more severe symptoms, such as abdominal pain, fever, and elevated liver enzymes.

B. Chronic viral infection of the liver (e.g., hepatitis B or C) would likely present with more prominent liver enzyme elevations and potentially other symptoms like fatigue, nausea, and vomiting.

D. Defective bilirubin excretion would suggest a diagnosis like Dubin-Johnson syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, not unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

E. Macrovesicular steatosis (fatty liver disease) may cause elevated liver enzymes, but it would not typically present with jaundice or scleral icterus.

Gilbert's syndrome is a common and benign condition that can be diagnosed with a thorough medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, including bilirubin levels and genetic testing.",Success
A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of vertigo and feeling unsteady while walking. She reports that she has had episodic tinnitus in her right ear for the past 3 years. Neurologic examination shows hearing loss in the right ear. An MRI of the brain is shown. Pathologic examination of this patient's lesion is most likely to show which of the following?,C,"The correct answer is C. Hypercellular areas of spindle cells and hypocellular areas of myxoid stroma.

The patient's symptoms, including vertigo, unsteadiness, and hearing loss, are consistent with a diagnosis of acoustic neuroma (also known as vestibular schwannoma). The MRI image provided likely shows a tumor in the cerebellopontine angle, which is a common location for acoustic neuromas.

Pathologically, acoustic neuromas are characterized by hypercellular areas of spindle cells and hypocellular areas of myxoid stroma. This histological appearance is consistent with a benign tumor of Schwann cell origin.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Whorls of densely packed cells with areas of lamellated calcification are characteristic of a meningioma, not an acoustic neuroma.

B. Small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil are characteristic of a neuroblastoma, a type of childhood cancer.

D. Pleomorphic cells clustered around necrotic areas forming pseudopalisades are characteristic of a glioblastoma, a type of malignant brain tumor.

E. Cells with clear cytoplasm and central round nucleus resembling a fried egg are characteristic of a lipoblast, which is not related to the patient's symptoms or the MRI image.

Current medical guidelines and evidence-based sources, such as the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System, support this answer.",Success
A 47-year-old female presents to her primary physician for follow up after an ED visit for nephrolithiasis 1 week prior. CT scan in the ED revealed a 4-mm stone occluding the right ureter. She was able to pass the stone without assistance over the course of 5 hours. Pathology report on the stone states it was composed of calcium oxalate. She says that the pain of passing the stone was excruciating and asks how she can prevent kidney stones in the future. Which of the following interventions is most likely to prevent renal calculi formation in the future for this patient?,B,"The correct answer is B. Decreasing sodium intake.

Here's why:

* Calcium oxalate stones are the most common type of kidney stones, and they are often associated with high sodium intake. A high-sodium diet can increase urinary excretion of calcium, which can increase the risk of stone formation.
* The American Urological Association (AUA) and the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) recommend reducing sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams per day to help prevent recurrent kidney stones.
* Decreasing calcium intake (Option A) is not recommended, as it may actually increase the risk of stone formation. Calcium binds to oxalate in the gut, reducing its absorption and subsequent excretion in the urine. Adequate calcium intake is important for overall health, and reducing it may not be beneficial for stone prevention.
* Nuts and seeds (Option C) are not a significant risk factor for kidney stone formation, and increasing their consumption is not a recommended strategy for prevention.
* Loop diuretics (Option D) are not typically used for stone prevention, and they may even increase the risk of stone formation by reducing urinary volume and increasing urinary concentration of stone-forming substances.
* Cranberry juice (Option E) has been suggested to have potential benefits in preventing urinary tract infections, but there is limited evidence to support its use in preventing kidney stone formation. Urine acidification is not a recommended strategy for preventing calcium oxalate stones.

In summary, decreasing sodium intake is the most evidence-based intervention to help prevent renal calculi formation in this patient.",Success
"A 62-year-old man comes to the physician because of worsening involuntary movements of both arms for the past 7 months. He reports that certain daily activities have become more difficult to perform. His father had a similar condition that was treated with medications. The patient appears anxious. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a low-amplitude tremor bilaterally when the arms are outstretched that worsens when reaching out to grab a pen. Muscle strength and tone is normal bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. On mental status examination, his mood is good. His speech is normal in rate and rhythm. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",E,"The correct answer is E. Propranolol therapy.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the low-amplitude tremor bilaterally when the arms are outstretched, which worsens when reaching out to grab a pen, are consistent with essential tremor (ET). ET is a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary, rhythmic tremors of the hands, arms, or other parts of the body.

Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is a commonly used medication for the treatment of essential tremor. It has been shown to be effective in reducing tremor amplitude and improving functional abilities in patients with ET (1).

The other options are not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient:

A. Deep brain stimulation is a surgical procedure that may be considered for patients with severe, medication-resistant ET, but it is not a first-line treatment.

B. Thalamotomy is a surgical procedure that involves destroying a small portion of the thalamus to relieve tremors, but it is not a commonly used treatment for ET and is typically reserved for patients with severe, medication-resistant tremors.

C. Levodopa and carbidopa therapy is used to treat Parkinson's disease, not essential tremor.

D. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that may be used to treat anxiety or other conditions, but it is not a primary treatment for essential tremor.

"Ten days after undergoing a cadaveric renal transplant, a 21-year-old man has pain in the right lower abdomen and generalized fatigue. During the past 2 days, he has had decreasing urinary output. He passed 5 liters of urine on the second postoperative day and serum studies showed a creatinine concentration of 2.1 mg/dL. He has adult polycystic kidney disease and was on maintenance hemodialysis for 2 months prior to transplantation. Current medications include azathioprine, cyclosporine, prednisone, and enalapril. He appears lethargic. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 164/94 mm Hg. Examination shows a healing surgical incision in the right lower abdomen. The graft site shows tenderness to palpation. His blood urea nitrogen concentration is 52 mg/dL, creatinine concentration is 4.1 mg/dL. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows tubulitis. C4d staining is negative. Which of the following is the most likely responsible for this patient's findings?",A,"The correct answer is A. Recipient T-cells in the graft.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as pain in the right lower abdomen, generalized fatigue, and decreasing urinary output, suggest acute kidney injury. The biopsy results showing tubulitis, which is a hallmark of acute cellular rejection, support this diagnosis. The absence of C4d staining, a marker for antibody-mediated rejection, suggests that the rejection is not antibody-mediated.

The presence of tubulitis, which is characterized by infiltration of T-cells into the tubules, indicates that the recipient's T-cells are attacking the graft. This is consistent with acute cellular rejection, which is a common complication of kidney transplantation.

Option B, drug-induced nephrotoxicity, is unlikely because the patient's medications, including azathioprine, cyclosporine, and enalapril, are not typically associated with nephrotoxicity at the doses used in kidney transplantation.

Option C, fibrosis of the glomerular vessels, is not consistent with the patient's biopsy results, which show tubulitis, not fibrosis.

Option D, polyomavirus-associated nephropathy, is a viral infection that can cause kidney injury, but it is not typically associated with tubulitis or acute cellular rejection.

Option E, newly formed anti-HLA antibodies, would be expected to cause antibody-mediated rejection, which is not supported by the negative C4d staining.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient's findings is acute cellular rejection, mediated by the recipient's T-cells attacking the graft.",Success
"A 58-year-old woman presents to the office for routine follow-up. She recently underwent routine screening for bone density due to a history of hypothyroidism. She also has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that is being treated with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) and more recently with a histamine2 receptor antagonist (H2RA), hypertension being treated with a thiazide diuretic, depression being treated with lithium, and hormone replacement therapy. Her results meet the criteria for osteopenia, with a T-score of -1.6. She is concerned about progressive bone loss and the risk of fractures. Which of the following medication classes should be discontinued?",A,"The correct answer is A. Proton-pump inhibitors.

The patient's concern about progressive bone loss and fracture risk is valid, given her osteopenia diagnosis. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures, particularly with long-term use. This is thought to be due to the inhibition of gastric acid production, which can lead to decreased calcium absorption and subsequent bone loss.

The other options are not directly related to bone loss or osteoporosis:

B. Thiazide diuretics are actually known to have a positive effect on bone density, as they can reduce urinary calcium excretion and promote calcium retention.

C. Histamine2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) are not typically associated with bone loss or osteoporosis.

D. Lithium is not known to have a significant impact on bone density or osteoporosis risk.

E. Estrogen, as part of hormone replacement therapy, may actually have a beneficial effect on bone density, particularly in postmenopausal women.

Discontinuing the PPI would be a reasonable step in addressing the patient's concerns about bone loss and fracture risk. However, it's essential to weigh this decision against the benefits of PPI therapy for her GERD management and consider alternative treatments or adjustments to her medication regimen.",Success

There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) laceration over the abdomen and a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over the scalp. Jugular venous pressure is increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft. Two large bore intravenous catheters are inserted and 0.9% saline infusion is begun. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) is negative. An electrocardiogram shows absent p-waves. After 5 minutes, his pulse is 160/min and palpable systolic blood pressure is 50 mm Hg. Vasopressors are administered. One hour later, the patient dies. Which of the following was the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is C. Aortic dissection.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation is consistent with a severe injury, as evidenced by the multiple ecchymoses, lacerations, and hemodynamic instability. The key findings that point to aortic dissection as the most likely diagnosis are:

1. **Irregularly irregular pulse**: This suggests a possible cardiac rhythm disturbance, which is consistent with aortic dissection.
2. **Increased jugular venous pressure**: This indicates elevated central venous pressure, which can be seen in aortic dissection due to obstruction of the aorta.
3. **Bilateral crackles at the lung bases**: This suggests pulmonary edema, which can be a complication of aortic dissection.
4. **Absent P-waves on the electrocardiogram**: This is consistent with a cardiac conduction abnormality, which can occur in aortic dissection.
5. **Rapid deterioration of hemodynamic status**: The patient's blood pressure and pulse rate worsened rapidly, despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressor administration, which is consistent with a catastrophic injury like aortic dissection.

While the other options are possible, they are less likely given the patient's presentation:

A. Cardiac contusion: Although possible, the patient's electrocardiogram and hemodynamic instability are more consistent with aortic dissection.

B. Hemothorax: The patient's chest examination shows ecchymoses, but there is no mention of decreased breath sounds or tracheal deviation, which would be expected in a hemothorax.

D. Pulmonary contusion: The patient's bilateral crackles are more consistent with pulmonary edema than a pulmonary contusion.

E. Cardiac tamponade: The patient's FAST examination was negative, making cardiac tamponade less likely.

In summary, the combination of the patient's irregular pulse, increased jugular venous pressure, bilateral crackles, and rapid hemodynamic deterioration make aortic dissection the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 65-year-old man with a longstanding history of poorly-controlled hypertension and no recent illness or cardiac disease presents to clinic complaining of chest pain that is worse on inspiration and relieved by sitting forward. Vital signs are stable. On exam, you detect a friction rub. Routine labs show K 7.5 and Cr 5.1. If this patient's clinical signs and laboratory findings are indicative of a chronic condition, what would be expected on urinary analysis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Broad and waxy casts.

The patient's symptoms, such as chest pain worsened by inspiration and relieved by sitting forward, suggest pericarditis, which is supported by the presence of a friction rub on physical examination. The laboratory findings of hyperkalemia (K 7.5) and elevated creatinine (Cr 5.1) indicate chronic kidney disease (CKD).

In the context of CKD, the expected finding on urinary analysis would be broad and waxy casts. These types of casts are characteristic of chronic kidney disease and indicate chronic nephron damage. Broad and waxy casts are formed when the tubular cells and proteins accumulate in the tubules, causing the casts to become wider and more irregular in shape.

The other options are not directly related to chronic kidney disease:

A. Muddy brown granular casts are typically seen in acute tubular necrosis.

B. Red blood cell casts are indicative of glomerular damage, such as in glomerulonephritis.

C. White blood cell casts are seen in pyelonephritis or interstitial nephritis.

D. Fatty casts are associated with nephrotic syndrome.

The rest of the examination is unremarkable except for an enlarged, nontender left supraclavicular node. In addition to a fine needle aspiration or biopsy, which of the following tests should also be included in further assessment of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is A. Chest radiograph.

Here's why:

The patient presents with an enlarged, nontender left supraclavicular node, which is a concerning finding that warrants further evaluation. The supraclavicular nodes are a common site for metastatic cancer, particularly from primary tumors in the lung, breast, stomach, and pancreas.

Given the patient's history of smoking and sedentary lifestyle, lung cancer is a strong consideration. A chest radiograph is a simple, non-invasive, and cost-effective test that can help identify any lung lesions or abnormalities that may be related to the enlarged supraclavicular node.

Fine needle aspiration or biopsy of the node is also necessary to determine the cytological or histological diagnosis, but a chest radiograph should be included in the initial workup to assess for any potential primary lung lesions.

The other options are not as relevant in this scenario:

* Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (B) may be considered if there is suspicion of gastric cancer, but it is not the most likely cause of an isolated supraclavicular node in this patient.
* Computed tomography (CT) of the head and neck (C) may be useful for evaluating the node itself, but it is not as sensitive as a chest radiograph for detecting lung lesions.
* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (D) is not indicated in this scenario, as there is no evidence of neurological symptoms or signs.
* Ultrasound of the neck (E) may be useful for evaluating the node, but it is not as effective as a chest radiograph for detecting potential lung lesions.

Current vitals include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse 63/min, blood pressure 128/91 mm Hg and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, there is elevated jugular venous pressure, decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the lung bases, and 1+ non-pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities. A chest X-ray demonstrates a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the diagnosis of this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Echocardiography.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest heart failure, particularly right-sided heart failure. The elevated jugular venous pressure, decreased breath sounds at the lung bases, and bilateral non-pitting edema in the lower extremities are all indicative of right ventricular failure. The slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette on the chest X-ray further supports this diagnosis.

Echocardiography is a non-invasive, widely available, and cost-effective imaging modality that can provide valuable information about cardiac structure and function. It can help diagnose heart failure, assess left and right ventricular function, and identify potential underlying causes such as valvular disease, cardiomyopathy, or pulmonary hypertension.

While the other options may be useful in certain contexts, they are not the most appropriate next step in this patient's diagnosis:

A. Bronchoalveolar wash is an invasive procedure typically used to diagnose infections such as pneumonia or tuberculosis, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms or physical examination.

B. Pulmonary function studies may be useful in evaluating lung function, but they would not provide direct information about cardiac function or structure.

D. Chest CT may be useful in evaluating lung parenchyma or mediastinal structures, but it would not provide the same level of information about cardiac function as echocardiography.

E. Biopsy of the heart is an invasive procedure that is typically reserved for specific circumstances, such as diagnosing cardiac tumors or infiltrative diseases, and is not indicated in this patient's case.

"A 67-year-old woman with depression comes to the physician because of easy bruising and bleeding of her gums for the past 2 months. She has been living alone since the death of her husband 1 year ago. She appears thin and has temporal wasting bilaterally. Physical examination shows bruises on her lower legs, swollen gums, and petechiae on the hard palate. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to defective synthesis of a substance that is composed primarily of which of the following amino acids?",A,"The correct answer is B. Proline.

The patient's symptoms, such as easy bruising, bleeding gums, and petechiae, are indicative of a bleeding disorder. The physical examination findings, including temporal wasting and thin appearance, suggest malnutrition. The combination of these symptoms and physical findings points towards a diagnosis of scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C (ascorbic acid).

Vitamin C is essential for the synthesis of collagen, a protein that provides structure and strength to connective tissue. Collagen is composed primarily of the amino acids glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline. Proline is a key amino acid involved in the formation of collagen, and its hydroxylation is dependent on vitamin C.

In scurvy, the deficiency of vitamin C impairs the hydroxylation of proline, leading to defective collagen synthesis and the characteristic bleeding and bruising symptoms. Therefore, the patient's symptoms are most likely due to defective synthesis of collagen, which is composed primarily of proline.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the underlying disease process:

A. Glycine is an amino acid involved in collagen synthesis, but it is not the primary amino acid affected in scurvy.

C. Tyrosine is an amino acid involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters and melanin, but it is not directly related to collagen synthesis or scurvy.

"A 49-year-old female with a history of alcoholism was found lying unconscious on a bench at a local park and rushed to the emergency department. Upon arrival, the patient regained consciousness and complained of intense bilateral flank pain and a recent decrease in urination. Urine microscopy demonstrated abundant square crystals of calcium oxalate that looked like “folded envelopes."" Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen in this patient:",B,"The correct answer is C. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning, which is a common complication of alcoholism. Ethylene glycol is a toxic substance found in antifreeze, and its ingestion can cause severe metabolic acidosis.

The presence of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine, which resemble ""folded envelopes,"" is a characteristic feature of ethylene glycol poisoning. These crystals are formed when oxalate, a metabolite of ethylene glycol, combines with calcium in the urine.

In ethylene glycol poisoning, the metabolic acidosis is typically non-anion gap, meaning that the anion gap (a calculation that estimates the presence of unmeasured anions in the blood) is normal or only slightly elevated. This is because the acidosis is primarily caused by the accumulation of oxalic acid, which is a strong acid that dissociates completely in the blood, rather than an unmeasured anion.

Therefore, option C, non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, is the most likely finding in this patient.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Metabolic alkalosis is not typically seen in ethylene glycol poisoning.

B. Anion gap metabolic acidosis is more commonly seen in conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, or salicylate poisoning, rather than ethylene glycol poisoning.

D. Respiratory acidosis is not directly related to ethylene glycol poisoning and would not explain the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.

Urinary hesitancy due to benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Selective alpha-1 agonists, such as tamsulosin, are commonly used to treat urinary retention and hesitancy associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). These medications work by relaxing the smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, allowing for easier urination.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Bronchospasm due to bronchial asthma: Selective alpha-1 agonists are not typically used to treat bronchospasm or asthma. Instead, medications like beta-2 agonists (e.g., albuterol) and corticosteroids are commonly used.

B. Bilateral hand tremors of indeterminate etiology: Alpha-1 agonists are not typically used to treat tremors. Instead, medications like beta blockers (e.g., propranolol) or anticonvulsants (e.g., primidone) may be used to treat certain types of tremors.

D. Nasal congestion due to a viral infection: While alpha-1 agonists can cause vasoconstriction, which may help relieve nasal congestion, they are not typically used to treat viral infections like the common cold. Instead, medications like decongestants (e.g., pseudoephedrine) or antihistamines may be used.

E. Blood pressure management prior to pheochromocytoma excision: Alpha-1 antagonists (e.g., phenoxybenzamine), not agonists, are typically used to manage blood pressure in patients with pheochromocytoma, a type of adrenal gland tumor.

Laboratory studies show the presence of anti-hepatitis A IgM antibodies. A liver biopsy performed at this time would most likely show which of the following histopathological findings?",A,"The correct answer is B. Acellular debris surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, right upper quadrant pain, myalgia, jaundice, and tender hepatomegaly, are consistent with acute hepatitis. The presence of anti-hepatitis A IgM antibodies in the laboratory studies confirms the diagnosis of acute hepatitis A.

In acute hepatitis, the liver biopsy would typically show a pattern of lobular inflammation, with the following histopathological findings:

* Acellular debris (necrotic hepatocytes) surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages, which is the characteristic feature of acute hepatitis.
* Inflammation and necrosis of hepatocytes, with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils.
* Activation of Kupffer cells, which are the resident macrophages of the liver.

The other options are not consistent with the diagnosis of acute hepatitis A:

A. Hepatocytes with shrunken, eosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei are characteristic of apoptosis, which is seen in chronic liver disease or liver cirrhosis, not in acute hepatitis.

C. Cystic spaces with scattered areas of cellular debris are more consistent with a diagnosis of liver abscess or cystic liver disease.

D. Basophilic adipocyte remnants, filled with calcifications, are characteristic of adipocere, a rare condition that occurs in the setting of fat necrosis.

A. Decreased levels of IgA: While IgA deficiency can be associated with various autoimmune disorders, it is not specifically related to AS or the patient's presentation.

B. Diminished pulses in the lower extremity: This finding is more consistent with peripheral artery disease or other vascular conditions, which are not supported by the patient's symptoms or physical exam.

C. Narrowing of the spinal canal when standing upright: This finding is more consistent with spinal stenosis, which is a different condition that affects the spinal canal.

D. Pain with elevation of his leg while laying down: This finding is more consistent with herniated discs or other lumbar spine conditions, which are not supported by the patient's symptoms or physical exam.

It's essential to note that a definitive diagnosis of AS requires a combination of clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings, including imaging studies and HLA-B27 testing. However, based on the patient's presentation, AS is a strong consideration, and the correct answer is associated with this condition.",Success
"A 9-month-old boy is brought to his pediatrician by his mother for a routine health checkup. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. He was breastfed for the first 3 months and then switched to cow’s milk and about two months ago she started giving him fruits and vegetables. Family history is noncontributory. Today, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, and temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F). On examination, he has a heartbeat with a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Generally, the boy looks pale. His weight and height fall within the expected range. A complete blood count (CBC) shows the following:
Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.1 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): 65 fL
Total iron binding capacity (TIBC): 550 μg/dL
Serum iron: 45 µg/dL
Serum lead: < 5 µg/dL
What is the best treatment for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Proper diet and iron supplementation.

Let's break down the patient's presentation and lab results:

* The patient is 9 months old, breastfed for 3 months, and then switched to cow's milk and started solids (fruits and vegetables) 2 months ago.
* The patient appears pale, which could be a sign of anemia.
* The CBC shows a low hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.1 g/dL, indicating anemia.
* The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 65 fL, which is low, suggesting microcytic anemia.
* The total iron binding capacity (TIBC) is elevated at 550 μg/dL, indicating iron deficiency.
* The serum iron level is low at 45 µg/dL, further supporting iron deficiency.
* The serum lead level is normal, ruling out lead toxicity as a cause of anemia.

Given the patient's age, diet, and lab results, the most likely diagnosis is iron deficiency anemia. This is a common condition in infants and toddlers, especially those who are not receiving adequate iron from their diet.

The best treatment for this patient is proper diet and iron supplementation (Option B). This includes:

* Encouraging a diet rich in iron, such as iron-fortified cereals, pureed meats, and iron-rich fruits and vegetables.
* Supplementing with iron drops or ferrous sulfate to replenish iron stores.

Iron supplementation alone (Option A) may not be sufficient, as the patient also needs guidance on a proper diet to ensure adequate iron intake. Multivitamins (Option C) may not provide sufficient iron to correct the deficiency. Proper diet alone (Option D) may not be enough to correct the anemia, especially if the patient's diet has been inadequate in iron up until this point. Lead chelation therapy (Option E) is not indicated, as the serum lead level is normal.

It's essential to note that the patient's pediatrician should also provide guidance on preventing iron deficiency anemia in the future, such as introducing iron-rich foods at an early age and monitoring for signs of anemia.",Success
"A 39-year-old woman, with a history of thyroidectomy and primary hyperparathyroidism presents for surgical evaluation for a right adrenal mass. Preoperatively, which of the following medications should she receive to prevent a hypertensive emergency intraoperatively?",E,"The correct answer is E. Phenoxybenzamine.

Here's why:

The patient has a history of primary hyperparathyroidism and presents with a right adrenal mass, which suggests a possible diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that produces excessive amounts of catecholamines, leading to hypertension. 

To prevent a hypertensive emergency intraoperatively, alpha-adrenergic blockade is necessary to counteract the effects of catecholamine release during surgery. Phenoxybenzamine is a non-selective alpha-adrenergic blocker that is commonly used to prepare patients with pheochromocytoma for surgery. It helps to reduce blood pressure and prevent hypertensive crises.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Atenolol is a beta-blocker, which is not effective in preventing hypertensive crises in patients with pheochromocytoma.

B. Labetolol is an alpha-beta blocker, but it is not typically used as a first-line agent for preparing patients with pheochromocytoma for surgery.

C. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, which is not effective in preventing hypertensive crises in patients with pheochromocytoma.

D. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker, which may actually increase catecholamine release and worsen hypertension in patients with pheochromocytoma.

It's essential to note that the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma should be confirmed through biochemical testing (e.g., plasma metanephrines) and imaging studies before surgery.",Success
"A 58-year-old male is diagnosed with hypertension and started on daily propranolol after failing antihypertensive therapy with other medications. Three months later, his blood pressure appears to be adequately controlled on this therapy. While working in his garden one afternoon, the patient is stung by a wasp and experiences a severe anaphylactic reaction that is subsequently treated with epinephrine. Which of the following effects would be expected upon administration of this epinephrine treatment?",C,"The correct answer is E. Increased heart rate.

Here's why:

Propranolol is a non-selective beta blocker, which means it blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors. Beta-1 receptors are primarily located in the heart, where they stimulate increased heart rate and contractility. Beta-2 receptors are primarily located in the lungs, where they stimulate bronchodilation.

In an anaphylactic reaction, epinephrine (also known as adrenaline) is administered to counteract the severe allergic response. Epinephrine is a beta-agonist, which means it stimulates both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors.

However, in this patient, who is taking propranolol, the beta blocker will block the beta-1 receptors in the heart, reducing the chronotropic (heart rate) and inotropic (contractility) effects of epinephrine. This means that the patient's heart rate may not increase as expected in response to epinephrine administration.

On the other hand, epinephrine's effect on beta-2 receptors in the lungs will not be blocked by propranolol, so bronchodilation will still occur, which is important in anaphylaxis to relieve bronchospasm.

The other options are incorrect:

A. Decreased bronchodilation: As mentioned, epinephrine's effect on beta-2 receptors will not be blocked by propranolol, so bronchodilation will still occur.

B. Increased motility of the gastrointestinal tract: Epinephrine does not have a significant effect on gastrointestinal motility.

C. Decreased heart rate: While propranolol may reduce the chronotropic effect of epinephrine, it will not cause a decrease in heart rate.

D. Decreased blood pressure: Epinephrine is a vasopressor, which means it increases blood pressure, not decreases it.

It's essential to note that using epinephrine in a patient taking a beta blocker like propranolol may not be as effective in increasing heart rate and blood pressure, which are critical responses in anaphylaxis. This highlights the importance of careful consideration when prescribing medications, especially in patients with multiple conditions or allergies.",Success
"An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for short stature. Neither his clothing nor his shoe size have changed over the past year. He also frequently bumps into obstacles such as furniture and has headaches at night. He is always thirsty for cold water and has been urinating more frequently. Three years ago, he had an asthma attack that was treated with albuterol and a one-week course of steroids. His mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis and had precocious puberty. His mother's height is 147 cm (4 ft 10 in) and his father's height is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in). He is at the 5th percentile for height and 5th percentile for weight. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 100/64 mm Hg. Examination shows a soft and nontender abdomen.

Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 2.1 mcg/mL (N=1.6–6.5 μg/mL)
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?""",C,"The correct answer is C. Craniopharyngioma.

Here's a breakdown of the patient's symptoms and laboratory results that support this diagnosis:

1. Short stature: The patient's height is at the 5th percentile, and he has not grown in the past year, indicating growth hormone deficiency.
2. Headaches at night: This suggests increased intracranial pressure, which is consistent with a space-occupying lesion in the brain, such as a craniopharyngioma.
3. Polydipsia and polyuria: The patient's frequent thirst and urination are indicative of diabetes insipidus, which is often caused by damage to the posterior pituitary gland or hypothalamus. Craniopharyngiomas can compress or infiltrate these structures, leading to diabetes insipidus.
4. Normal thyroid function: The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T4) levels are within normal limits, making thyroid-related growth hormone deficiency unlikely.
5. Low insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels: These results suggest growth hormone deficiency, which is consistent with a pituitary tumor or damage to the pituitary gland.

Craniopharyngiomas are benign tumors that arise from remnants of the Rathke's pouch, a structure that forms the anterior pituitary gland during embryonic development. They can compress or infiltrate the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, and surrounding structures, leading to various endocrine deficiencies, including growth hormone deficiency and diabetes insipidus.

The other options are less likely based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Rathke cleft cyst: While Rathke cleft cysts can cause pituitary hormone deficiencies, they are typically asymptomatic and do not typically cause diabetes insipidus.

B. Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome: This condition is characterized by multiple endocrine gland failures, but it is unlikely to cause isolated growth hormone deficiency and diabetes insipidus.

D. Multiple endocrine neoplasia: This is a genetic disorder that causes tumors in multiple endocrine glands, but it is unlikely to cause isolated growth hormone deficiency and diabetes insipidus.

E. Pituitary adenoma: While pituitary adenomas can cause growth hormone deficiency, they are less likely to cause diabetes insipidus, and the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are more consistent with a craniopharyngioma.",Success
"A 31-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 32 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department for clear vaginal discharge that started roughly 26 hours ago. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her first child was born at term by vaginal delivery. She has no history of any serious illnesses. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. Current medications include vitamin supplements. Her temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg. Speculum examination demonstrates clear fluid at the cervical os. The fetal heart rate is reactive at 160/min with no decelerations. Tocometry shows uterine contractions. Nitrazine testing is positive. She is started on indomethacin. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is E. Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with induction of labor.

Here's why:

The patient presents with clear vaginal discharge, which is likely amniotic fluid, as confirmed by the positive nitrazine test. This indicates preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). The patient is at 32 weeks' gestation, which is a critical period for fetal lung development. The goal of management is to promote fetal lung maturity while minimizing the risk of infection and other complications.

Indomethacin has been started, which is appropriate for tocolysis (reducing uterine contractions) and may help prolong the pregnancy. However, the next step is to administer betamethasone, a corticosteroid, to promote fetal lung maturity. This is a standard practice for patients with PPROM between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation, as recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).

Ampicillin is also indicated to prevent group B streptococcal infection, which is a common complication of PPROM.

Induction of labor is the next step, as the patient's membranes are already ruptured, and the risk of infection and other complications increases with time. Proceeding with induction of labor will help to deliver the baby in a controlled environment, minimizing the risk of complications.

Options A, B, C, and D are not correct because:

A. Amnioinfusion is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient's membranes are already ruptured.

B. Progesterone is not typically used in the management of PPROM.

C. Testing amniotic fluid for fetal lung maturity is not necessary, as the patient is already at 32 weeks' gestation, and betamethasone will help promote fetal lung maturity.

D. Cesarean section is not indicated at this point, as the patient's fetus is not in distress, and vaginal delivery is a safer option.",Success
"A 63-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 4-day history of lower abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. He has a history of constipation. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°C). Abdominal examination shows left lower quadrant tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 19,000/mm3. A CT scan of the abdomen shows segmental wall thickening of the descending colon with multiple diverticula and a 5.0-cm, low-attenuation pelvic lesion with air-fluid levels. CT-guided drainage of the fluid collection yields 250 mL of yellow-greenish fluid. Release of which of the following substances is most likely responsible for the formation of the drained lesion?",E,"The correct answer is E. Lysosomal enzymes.

The patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are consistent with diverticulitis, a common condition characterized by inflammation of the diverticula in the colon. The presence of a 5.0-cm, low-attenuation pelvic lesion with air-fluid levels suggests an abscess formation, which is a complication of diverticulitis.

The drained fluid is described as yellow-greenish, which is consistent with pus. The formation of an abscess is likely due to the release of lysosomal enzymes from neutrophils and macrophages that have accumulated in response to the infection. Lysosomal enzymes, such as proteases, lipases, and hydrolases, break down tissue and contribute to the formation of an abscess cavity.

The other options are not directly related to the formation of an abscess in this context:

A. Staphylococcal coagulase is a virulence factor produced by Staphylococcus aureus, which is not typically associated with diverticulitis.

B. Interferon-gamma is a cytokine involved in the immune response, but it is not directly related to the formation of an abscess.

C. Lipoteichoic acid is a component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria, but it is not a key factor in the formation of an abscess.

D. Interleukin-3 is a cytokine involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis, but it is not directly related to the formation of an abscess.

Current medical guidelines, such as those from the American College of Gastroenterology, recommend CT-guided drainage of abscesses as a treatment option for complicated diverticulitis.",Success
A researcher is studying risk factors for open-angle glaucoma in a group of elderly patients at a primary care clinic. He is curious if patients with diabetes (defined as fasting serum glucose ≥126 mg/dL on two separate readings) are at increased risk of developing open-angle glaucoma over time. Which of the following is the best statement of the null hypothesis for this study?,A,"The correct answer is A. The future risk of open-angle glaucoma is the same in patients with and those without diabetes.

The null hypothesis is a statement of no difference or no effect. In this study, the researcher is investigating whether diabetes is a risk factor for open-angle glaucoma. The null hypothesis would state that there is no association between diabetes and the risk of open-angle glaucoma.

Option A correctly states the null hypothesis, implying that the risk of open-angle glaucoma is the same in patients with and without diabetes. This means that the researcher is testing whether the data will reject this hypothesis, suggesting that diabetes is indeed a risk factor for open-angle glaucoma.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

B. This statement is close, but it's not a direct statement of the null hypothesis. It's more of a rephrased version of the research question.

C. This statement is about prevalence, not risk. The study is looking at the future risk of open-angle glaucoma, not the current prevalence.

D. This statement is actually the alternative hypothesis, which is the opposite of the null hypothesis. It suggests that diabetes is associated with an increased risk of open-angle glaucoma.

E. This statement is not relevant to the study question and is about the effectiveness of antidiabetic medications, which is not being investigated in this study.",Success
"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
Given the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?",B,"The correct answer is B. A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.

In the context of this study, if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error, it would mean that they concluded that mepolizumab is effective in reducing asthma exacerbations and improving markers of asthma control, but in reality, the null hypothesis (i.e., mepolizumab has no effect) is true. In other words, the study would have falsely detected a significant difference between the treatment groups and the placebo group.

Type 1 error, also known as alpha (α) error, occurs when a researcher rejects a true null hypothesis, which can lead to false positives. It is usually set at a level of 0.05, meaning that there is a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.

The other options are incorrect:

A. A type 1 error is not related to the power of a study, which is the ability to detect a true difference between groups.

C. This is actually the definition of a type 2 error, which occurs when the null hypothesis is false, but is accepted in error.

D. A type 1 error is not the same as a beta (β) error, which is the probability of failing to reject a false null hypothesis. Beta error is usually set at a level of 0.2 or 0.1, but it is not the same as a type 1 error.

E. A type 1 error is not dependent on the confidence interval of a study, although the confidence interval can provide information about the precision of the estimate and the likelihood of a type 1 error.",Success

What complications is this patient at risk for?",B,"The correct answer is A. Amaurosis fugax.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with Takayasu arteritis, a rare autoimmune disease that affects the aorta and its branches. The patient's absent radial pulse at the right wrist and decreased pulse at the left wrist suggest vascular involvement, which is a hallmark of Takayasu arteritis.

Amaurosis fugax is a complication of Takayasu arteritis, caused by transient ischemia of the retina due to occlusion of the ophthalmic artery. This can lead to temporary blindness or vision loss.

Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a left-sided, tender mass surrounded by edema and erythema in the left inner labia. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Incision and drainage.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of a Bartholin's abscess, which is a painful, swollen, and infected cyst that occurs on the labia. The abscess is typically caused by bacteria, such as E. coli or Staphylococcus aureus, and can be sexually transmitted.

Incision and drainage (I&D) is the most appropriate next step in management because it provides immediate relief from pain and allows for drainage of the infected material. This procedure involves making a small incision in the abscess, draining the pus, and packing the wound with gauze to promote healing.

Sitz baths (A) may be helpful in reducing discomfort and promoting healing after the I&D procedure, but they are not a substitute for drainage of the abscess.

Cryotherapy (B) is not a recommended treatment for Bartholin's abscess.

Biopsy (D) is not necessary in this case, as the diagnosis is clear based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (E) is an antibiotic that may be prescribed to treat the infection, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. The primary goal is to drain the abscess, and antibiotics can be prescribed afterwards to prevent further infection.

A 21-year-old female presents to the clinic requesting prenatal counseling. She was born with a disease that has led her to have recurrent upper respiratory infections throughout her life requiring antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. She marries a man (without this disease phenotype) from a population where the prevalence of this disease is 1/100. What is the chance that their child will have the disease of interest?,A,"The correct answer is B. 1/10.

The disease described is likely cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive disorder. The patient has a history of recurrent upper respiratory infections, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, and chest physiotherapy, which are all consistent with CF.

Since the patient has CF, she is homozygous for the mutated gene (ff). Her husband, being asymptomatic, is likely to be a carrier of the mutated gene (Ff), as the prevalence of CF in his population is 1/100. This means he has a 1/10 chance of being a carrier.

When a carrier (Ff) mates with an affected individual (ff), the probability of their offspring inheriting the disease is 1/2, as they can inherit either the normal gene (F) or the mutated gene (f) from the carrier parent. However, since the patient is homozygous for the mutated gene (ff), all her gametes will carry the mutated gene (f). Therefore, the probability of their child inheriting the disease is 1/2, as they will inherit one mutated gene (f) from the patient and have a 1/2 chance of inheriting the mutated gene (f) from the carrier father.

So, the chance that their child will have the disease is 1/2, which is equivalent to 1/10 in decimal form.",Success

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A.

Here's why:

The patient presents with a combination of symptoms and laboratory results that are consistent with MEN 2A:

1. Thyromegaly (diffuse thyroid swelling) and elevated calcitonin levels suggest medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), which is a hallmark of MEN 2A.
2. Elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines indicate the presence of a pheochromocytoma, another characteristic feature of MEN 2A.
3. The patient's symptoms of headache, palpitations, and episodic diaphoresis are consistent with pheochromocytoma.
4. The presence of hypercalcemia suggests hyperparathyroidism, which is also a component of MEN 2A.
5. The patient's hypertension, despite being on antihypertensive medication, is likely due to the pheochromocytoma.

MEN 2A is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of MTC, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism.

* MEN 2B (Option D) is characterized by MTC, pheochromocytoma, and mucosal neuromas, but it does not typically involve hyperparathyroidism.
* Neurofibromatosis (Option E) is a genetic disorder characterized by tumors of the nerve tissue, but it is not typically associated with endocrine tumors.

He has worked as a car salesman for 15 years and worked in a shipyard before that for 22 years. He smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for 13 years but stopped 25 years ago. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Fine expiratory crackles are heard at both lung bases. An x-ray of the chest shows patchy infiltrates and supradiaphragmatic pleural thickening in both lungs. A photomicrograph from a sputum sample is shown. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",A,"The correct answer is A. Increased alveolar-arterial gradient.

The patient's symptoms, physical examination, and chest x-ray findings are consistent with asbestos-related lung disease, specifically asbestosis. The photomicrograph from the sputum sample likely shows asbestos bodies, which are a characteristic finding in asbestosis.

Asbestosis is a type of interstitial lung disease caused by prolonged exposure to asbestos fibers. It leads to inflammation, scarring, and fibrosis in the lungs, resulting in impaired gas exchange and respiratory function.

An increased alveolar-arterial gradient (A-a gradient) is a common finding in asbestosis, indicating impaired gas exchange and oxygenation. This is due to the scarring and fibrosis in the lungs, which reduce the surface area for gas exchange and increase the distance for oxygen to diffuse from the alveoli to the blood.

The other options are not directly related to asbestosis or the patient's symptoms:

B. Bloody pleural effusion is more commonly associated with malignancies, such as mesothelioma, which can also be caused by asbestos exposure. However, the patient's symptoms and chest x-ray findings are more consistent with asbestosis.

C. Increased total lung capacity is not typically seen in asbestosis, which is characterized by restrictive lung disease and decreased lung volumes.

D. Concave flow-volume loop is a finding seen in obstructive lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rather than restrictive lung diseases like asbestosis.

E. Increased diffusing capacity (DLCO) is not expected in asbestosis, as the disease impairs gas exchange and reduces DLCO.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Increased alveolar-arterial gradient.",Success
"A 45-year-old woman presents with sudden-onset dyspnea. Her past medical history is significant for varicose veins in her lower extremities, well-controlled diabetes mellitus type 2, and a 25 pack-year smoking history. The patient currently takes metformin and pioglitazone. Family history is significant for her sister who died at the age of 35 because of a pulmonary embolism. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), the pulse is 111/min, the respirations are 18/min, and the blood pressure is 130/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is pale and diaphoretic. Cardiac exam is significant for an S3 gallop. There is erythema and swelling over multiple varicose veins in her left leg. Ultrasound of her left leg is positive for a deep vein thrombosis. The patient is admitted, and anticoagulation is started with a vitamin K inhibitor. However, despite these interventions, she dies shortly after admission. Which of the following was the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Protein S deficiency.

Here's why:

The patient's presentation with sudden-onset dyspnea, tachycardia, and diaphoresis suggests a pulmonary embolism (PE). The ultrasound-confirmed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her left leg supports this diagnosis. The family history of a sister who died at a young age due to a PE raises suspicion for an underlying thrombophilia.

Protein S deficiency is a rare inherited thrombophilia that increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including DVT and PE. It is a strong risk factor for recurrent VTE, especially in individuals with a family history of thrombosis.

The other options are less likely:

A. Distal peripheral microembolism is not a plausible explanation for the patient's sudden-onset dyspnea and DVT.

B. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a complication of heparin therapy, but it typically occurs after several days of heparin exposure, and the patient's platelet count is not mentioned in the scenario.

C. Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe bacterial infection of the soft tissues, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation or the ultrasound findings.

E. Waldenström macroglobulinemia is a type of lymphoma that can cause hypercoagulability, but it is not typically associated with a family history of thrombosis or a presentation like this patient's.

In summary, the patient's presentation, family history, and ultrasound findings point towards a thrombophilia, and Protein S deficiency is the most likely etiology of her condition.",Success
"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother with increasing swelling of his right jaw for the past 2 months. She notes that he has been treated several times with different antibiotics, but that they have not helped. She reports no recent history of fever, chills, or night sweats. The boy has no significant medical history. He emigrated to the United States with his family from Nigeria 1 month ago. He is in the 85th percentile for height and weight, and he has been meeting all developmental milestones. His temperature is 37.8℃ (100.0℉). On physical examination, the patient has a prominent 8 × 8 cm mass over the right mandible. The mass has partially distorted the borders of the mandible and cheek. The overlying skin is erythematous. The mass is firm, immobile, and tender. The contralateral side of the face shows no abnormalities. An oral examination shows the disruption of the ipsilateral lower teeth and oral mucosa. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A biopsy of the mass is performed and a histopathologic analysis is seen in the image. Which of the following microorganisms is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including the large, firm, and tender mass over the right mandible, are consistent with a diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma. The histopathologic image shows a ""starry sky"" pattern, which is a characteristic feature of Burkitt lymphoma.

Burkitt lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. EBV is a common viral infection that is often asymptomatic, but it can cause infectious mononucleosis and is also linked to several types of cancer, including Burkitt lymphoma.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:

A. Babesia microti is a parasite that causes babesiosis, a rare tick-borne illness.

B. Bartonella henselae is a bacterium that causes cat-scratch disease.

C. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a viral infection that can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes, but it is not typically associated with Burkitt lymphoma.

E. Yersinia pestis is a bacterium that causes plague, a rare and serious bacterial infection.

It's worth noting that the patient's recent immigration from Nigeria may be relevant to the diagnosis, as Burkitt lymphoma is more common in certain parts of Africa, including Nigeria.",Success
"A 3-year-old male was brought to the pediatrician with severe lip lacerations, with a portion of his tongue appearing to be bitten off, as well as missing portions of the fingers on his right hand. A family history is notable for two similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side. A urinalysis revealed a high level of uric acid. Which of the following is the mode of inheritance for this disorder?",A,"The correct answer is A. X-linked recessive.

The symptoms described in the question, such as lip lacerations, tongue biting, and missing fingers, are consistent with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. The high level of uric acid in the urinalysis further supports this diagnosis.

Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), which is involved in the metabolism of purines. The disorder is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, meaning that the mutated gene is located on the X chromosome and is recessive, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disorder.

The family history of similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side is also consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance, as the mutated gene is passed down from the mother to her sons.

The other options are not correct:

B. X-linked dominant: This would mean that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disorder, but it would affect females as well as males. In Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, affected individuals are almost exclusively male.

C. Autosomal dominant: This would mean that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the disorder, and it would affect both males and females equally. However, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare disorder, and autosomal dominant inheritance would result in a higher frequency of affected individuals.

D. Autosomal recessive: This would mean that two copies of the mutated gene (one from each parent) are needed to cause the disorder. However, the family history and symptoms are not consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance.

E. Maternally inherited mitochondrial defect: This is not consistent with the symptoms and family history described, and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is not a mitochondrial disorder.",Success
An asymptomatic 65-year-old woman is found to have T-score of -2.6 SD on routine bone mineral density screening. She has a 10-year history of hypertension and an esophageal stricture due to severe gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia 20 years ago and treated with medroxyprogesterone. Menarche started at 11 years of age and her last menstrual period was 8 years ago. Her last mammography and PAP smear 6 months ago showed no abnormalities. Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 45 years. The patient does not have any children. Current medications include lansoprazole and hydrochlorothiazide. Her blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Treatment is begun with a drug that prevents further bone resorption and reduces her risk of developing breast cancer. This drug puts her at an increased risk of which of the following adverse effects?,E,"The correct answer is E. Deep vein thrombosis.

Based on the patient's history and physical examination, it is likely that she has been prescribed a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) such as raloxifene, which is commonly used to treat osteoporosis and reduce the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene is known to increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism, especially in women with a history of thromboembolic events.

The other options are not directly related to the treatment of osteoporosis with a SERM:

A. Mandibular osteonecrosis is a rare complication of bisphosphonate therapy, which is a different class of medications used to treat osteoporosis.

B. Skin infections are not a known adverse effect of SERMs.

C. Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that is not associated with SERM therapy.

D. Hypercholesterolemia is not a known adverse effect of SERMs. In fact, raloxifene has been shown to have a beneficial effect on lipid profiles.

"A 28-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 20 weeks' gestation comes to the physician with her husband for a prenatal visit. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. They are planning to travel to Ethiopia next month to visit the husband's family. Medications include folic acid and an iron supplement. Vital signs are within the normal range. Abdominal examination shows a uterus that is consistent with a 20-week gestation. Which of the following drugs is most suitable for pre-exposure prophylaxis against malaria?",C,"The correct answer is C. Mefloquine.

The patient is planning to travel to Ethiopia, which is a malaria-endemic area. Malaria prophylaxis is recommended for pregnant women traveling to such areas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), mefloquine is the most suitable drug for pre-exposure prophylaxis against malaria in pregnant women.

Here's why the other options are not suitable:

A. Doxycycline: This antibiotic is not recommended for malaria prophylaxis in pregnant women due to its potential to cause fetal harm.

B. Primaquine: This drug is not recommended for pregnant women because it can cause hemolytic anemia in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, which may not be diagnosed in the mother or fetus.

D. Chloroquine: While chloroquine is sometimes used for malaria treatment, it is not recommended for prophylaxis in pregnant women traveling to areas with chloroquine-resistant malaria, which is common in Ethiopia.

E. Proguanil: This drug is not recommended as a single agent for malaria prophylaxis in pregnant women. It is sometimes used in combination with atovaquone, but this combination is not recommended for pregnant women.

Mefloquine is the recommended drug for malaria prophylaxis in pregnant women traveling to areas with chloroquine-resistant malaria, such as Ethiopia.

"A 26-year-old man presents to the office complaining of persistent epigastric pain for the past 2 months. He states that his pain is worse a few hours after he eats. His father had similar symptoms. Past medical history is insignificant. He is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. The vital signs include blood pressure 120/90 mm Hg, heart rate 83/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). Physical examination is insignificant except for mild epigastric tenderness. A metabolic panel reveals the following:
Serum sodium 136 mEq/L
Serum potassium 4.2 mEq/L
Calcium 13.2 mg/dL
Bicarbonate 26 mEq/L
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals multiple duodenal ulcers. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is E. MEN1 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1).

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as persistent epigastric pain worsened by eating, and the presence of multiple duodenal ulcers on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, suggest a diagnosis related to excessive gastrin production. The patient's family history of similar symptoms also supports a genetic component.

The laboratory results are also consistent with this diagnosis. The elevated calcium level (13.2 mg/dL) suggests hyperparathyroidism, which is a common feature of MEN1. Additionally, the normal potassium level (4.2 mEq/L) makes VIPoma (option D) less likely, as VIPoma is often associated with hypokalemia.

MEN1 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by tumors in multiple endocrine glands, including the parathyroid glands, pancreas, and pituitary gland. One of the manifestations of MEN1 is gastrinoma, which leads to excessive gastrin production, causing Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by multiple duodenal ulcers, diarrhea, and elevated gastrin levels.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (option A) is unlikely given the presence of multiple duodenal ulcers. Gastric adenocarcinoma, intestinal type (option B), is not supported by the patient's symptoms or laboratory results. H. pylori infection (option C) may cause gastritis and ulcers, but it is not typically associated with multiple duodenal ulcers or hyperparathyroidism.

In conclusion, the combination of the patient's symptoms, family history, and laboratory results points to MEN1 as the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"The parents of a 16-year-old boy with type 1 diabetes mellitus present requesting information about the drug, exenatide, an injectable drug that only needs to be administered once a week. The patient’s blood glucose levels have been difficult to control on his current insulin regimen due to poor adherence to recommended therapy, and he has had difficulty putting on weight despite eating copiously. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. His body mass index (BMI) is 19 kg/m2. Which of the following best describes why the patient should not be switched to exenatide?",A,"The correct answer is A. Insulin production by the pancreas is insufficient for exenatide to be effective.

Exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, which is a type of medication used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. It works by stimulating the release of insulin and suppressing the release of glucagon, thereby improving glycemic control. However, exenatide is not effective in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, as they have insufficient insulin production by the pancreas. In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin, and exenatide would not be able to stimulate insulin release.

The other options are not correct:

B. Exenatide does suppress glucagon secretion, but it also stimulates insulin secretion, which would actually decrease the risk of hypoglycemia.

C. While exenatide can suppress appetite, which may be a concern for a patient who is underweight, this is not the primary reason why the patient should not be switched to exenatide.

D. Exenatide is approved for use in adults, but not in children below 18 years. However, this patient is 16 years old, so this is not the reason why exenatide is not suitable for him.

E. Exenatide does inhibit gastric emptying, which can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea and vomiting. However, this is not the primary reason why the patient should not be switched to exenatide.

In summary, exenatide is not suitable for this patient because he has type 1 diabetes mellitus, and exenatide is only effective in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have sufficient insulin production by the pancreas.",Success
"A 79-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a 2-month history of a non-productive cough and fatigue. During this period, she also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss and has become increasingly short of breath with mild exertion. She has congestive heart failure and hypertension. Three months ago, she was in India for 3 weeks to attend a family wedding. She worked as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 47 years. Her current medications include enalapril, digoxin, isosorbide, spironolactone, and metoprolol. She appears thin. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a glucose level of 90 mg/dL, serum lactate dehydrogenase of 227 U/L, and serum protein of 6.3 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows nodular pleural lesions on the right side and a moderate-sized pleural effusion. Thoracentesis shows 250 ml of turbid fluid. Analysis of the pleural fluid aspirate shows:
Erythrocyte count 1/mm3
Leukocyte count 4,000/mm3
Glucose 59 mg/dl
Lactate dehydrogenase 248 U/L
Protein 3.8 g/dL
Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's effusion?""",B,"The correct answer is A. Bronchial adenocarcinoma.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as non-productive cough, fatigue, weight loss, and shortness of breath, are consistent with lung cancer.
* The chest x-ray shows nodular pleural lesions on the right side and a moderate-sized pleural effusion, which suggests a malignant process.
* The pleural fluid analysis is consistent with an exudative effusion, which is typically seen in malignant or inflammatory conditions. The high protein level (3.8 g/dL) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (248 U/L) support this diagnosis.
* The patient's history of smoking (47 years) and occupation as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years increases her risk for lung cancer.
* The other options can be ruled out based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results:
	+ Mesothelioma (B) is a possibility given the patient's occupational history, but the pleural fluid analysis is not consistent with this diagnosis.
	+ Nephrotic syndrome (C) is unlikely given the patient's normal serum protein level and lack of edema.
	+ Tuberculosis (D) is possible given the patient's recent travel to India, but the pleural fluid analysis is not consistent with this diagnosis.
	+ Congestive heart failure (E) is unlikely given the patient's normal oxygen saturation and lack of other signs of heart failure.

According to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines, the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion is based on the presence of malignant cells in the pleural fluid or tissue, or a combination of clinical and radiographic findings consistent with malignancy. In this case, the patient's symptoms, radiographic findings, and pleural fluid analysis are consistent with a malignant process, making bronchial adenocarcinoma the most likely underlying cause of her effusion.",Success

Follicle-stimulating hormone 20 mIU/mL
Luteinizing hormone 160 mIU/mL
Testosterone 4.1 nmol/L (N < 3.5)
A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following tests is the most appropriate next step in screening for comorbidities in this patient?""",C,"The correct answer is C. Blood glucose and cholesterol level measurements.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder that affects ovulation and insulin resistance. The irregular menstrual bleeding, oily skin, acne, and excess hair growth (hirsutism) are all consistent with PCOS. The laboratory results, including the elevated dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), testosterone, and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, further support this diagnosis.

Given the high likelihood of PCOS, the most appropriate next step in screening for comorbidities is to measure blood glucose and cholesterol levels. Women with PCOS are at increased risk of developing insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia, which can lead to cardiovascular disease. Early detection and management of these comorbidities are essential to prevent long-term complications.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. 17-hydroxyprogesterone and cortisol level measurements are relevant for diagnosing congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

B. CA-125 level measurement is a tumor marker used to monitor ovarian cancer, which is not suspected in this patient.

D. TSH and T4 level measurements are relevant for diagnosing thyroid disorders, which are not suggested by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

E. Transvaginal ultrasonography may be useful in evaluating ovarian morphology, but it is not the most critical next step in screening for comorbidities in this patient.

A biopsy specimen of a cervical lymph node shows organized epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without focal necrosis. The initial treatment of this patient's condition should include which of the following drugs?",E,"The correct answer is C. Azithromycin.

Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and biopsy results, the diagnosis is likely Sarcoidosis, a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of granulomas in various organs, including the lungs and lymph nodes.

The CT scan of the chest shows bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, which is a common finding in Sarcoidosis. The biopsy specimen of a cervical lymph node shows organized epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without focal necrosis, consistent with non-caseating granulomas, a hallmark of Sarcoidosis.

The initial treatment of Sarcoidosis typically involves corticosteroids, such as prednisone, to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms. However, in this case, the correct answer is Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic. This is because the patient's symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with Sarcoidosis, and Azithromycin is sometimes used as a steroid-sparing agent or in combination with corticosteroids to treat Sarcoidosis, particularly in patients with mild to moderate disease.

Cisplatin (A) is a chemotherapy agent used to treat various types of cancer, but it is not indicated for Sarcoidosis. Lamivudine (B) is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV infection, which is not relevant to this patient's condition. Isoniazid (D) is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and biopsy results. Prednisone (E) is a corticosteroid that may be used to treat Sarcoidosis, but it is not the best answer in this case, as Azithromycin is a more specific treatment option based on the patient's presentation.",Success

Current medications include levothyroxine and metformin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. Physical examination shows mild vaginal atrophy and a normal cervix. The uterus and adnexa are nontender to palpation. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows an endometrial thickness of 6 mm. Endometrial biopsy shows non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands with no nuclear or cytological atypia. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Progestin therapy.

Here's why:

The patient presents with postmenopausal bleeding, which is defined as vaginal bleeding that occurs more than 1 year after menopause. The endometrial biopsy shows non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands with no nuclear or cytological atypia, which is consistent with a diagnosis of simple endometrial hyperplasia.

According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the primary treatment for simple endometrial hyperplasia is progestin therapy. Progestins can help to reverse the hyperplastic changes in the endometrium and reduce bleeding. The goal of treatment is to prevent progression to atypical hyperplasia or endometrial cancer.

Option A, total hysterectomy, is not necessary at this point, as the biopsy did not show any evidence of atypia or cancer. Additionally, hysterectomy is a surgical procedure that carries risks and should be reserved for cases where other treatments are not effective.

Option B, estrogen vaginal cream, is not indicated for the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia. Estrogen can actually stimulate the growth of the endometrium and worsen bleeding.

Option C, reassurance and follow-up, is not sufficient, as the patient is experiencing heavy bleeding that requires treatment.

Option E, surgical endometrial ablation, is not indicated for the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia. Endometrial ablation is a procedure that destroys the lining of the uterus and is typically used to treat heavy menstrual bleeding in premenopausal women.

"A 37-year-old woman with an HIV infection comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Six months ago, combined antiretroviral therapy consisting of dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine was initiated. Laboratory studies show a decrease in the CD4 count and an increase in the viral load despite ongoing treatment. The patient is switched to a new treatment regimen, including a drug that acts by preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation. Which of the following is the most likely drug?",B,"The correct answer is D. Raltegravir.

Here's why:

The patient is experiencing treatment failure with their current regimen, and a new drug is being added to prevent viral DNA synthesis. Raltegravir is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) that prevents the integration of viral DNA into the host cell genome. It does not require intracellular phosphorylation to be active, unlike some other antiretroviral medications.

Raltegravir is a common choice for treatment-experienced patients or those with resistance to other antiretroviral agents. It is often used in combination with other medications to create a new regimen.

Let's review the other options:

A. Enfuvirtide is a fusion inhibitor that prevents the entry of HIV into host cells. While it's an antiretroviral medication, it doesn't prevent viral DNA synthesis.

B. Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) that prevents viral replication by binding to the reverse transcriptase enzyme. It does undergo intracellular phosphorylation, so it's not the correct answer.

C. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor that prevents the maturation of viral particles. While it's an antiretroviral medication, it doesn't prevent viral DNA synthesis.

E. Lamivudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that prevents viral replication by incorporating into viral DNA. It does undergo intracellular phosphorylation, so it's not the correct answer.

Physical examination reveals a slight asymmetry of the facial muscles with an inability to whistle or close the right eye. A circular red rash with central clearing is present on the trunk. There is also decreased taste sensation. Which of the following most likely transmitted the organism responsible for this patient’s illness?,A,"The correct answer is A. Ixodes scapularis.

The patient's symptoms, including the sudden onset of facial drooping, drooling, and excessive tearing, suggest a diagnosis of facial nerve paralysis, also known as Bell's palsy. The presence of a circular red rash with central clearing on the trunk, known as erythema migrans, is a characteristic sign of Lyme disease. The decreased taste sensation is also consistent with Lyme disease.

Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis. The patient's recent trip to northern Maine, where Ixodes scapularis is commonly found, increases the likelihood of tick exposure.

The other options are not correct because:

Current medications include simvastatin, metformin, fenofibrate, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, glyburide, and lisinopril. Of these medications, which could contribute to the patient’s transaminitis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Simvastatin.

Simvastatin, a statin medication, is known to cause transaminitis (elevated liver enzymes) as a rare but potential side effect. Statins can cause a dose-dependent increase in liver enzymes, particularly alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST). This is more common at higher doses and in patients with pre-existing liver disease.

The other options are less likely to contribute to transaminitis:

A. Metformin is not typically associated with liver enzyme elevations.

C. Aspirin is not commonly linked to transaminitis, although high doses can cause liver damage in rare cases.

D. Glyburide, a sulfonylurea, is not typically associated with liver enzyme elevations.

E. Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, is not known to cause transaminitis.

Fenofibrate, a fibrate, can cause mild elevations in liver enzymes, but this is less common than with statins like simvastatin. Hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, is not typically associated with liver enzyme elevations.

During the first 2 days of clinical manifestations, the parents of the child tried to control the symptoms using acetaminophen; however, the newborn continued to be ill, and blisters were noticeable around the buttocks, hands, and feet. During the physical examination, the vital signs include body temperature 39.0°C (102.3°F), heart rate 130/min, and respiratory rate 45/min. Ears, nose, and oral mucosa preserved their integrity, while the skin presents with diffuse blanching erythema and flaccid blisters with a positive Nikolsky’s sign. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Scalded skin syndrome.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, irritability, and generalized erythema, are consistent with a skin infection. The presence of blisters around the buttocks, hands, and feet, along with a positive Nikolsky's sign, suggests a diagnosis of scalded skin syndrome (SSS).

SSS is a rare but serious skin infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus, typically affecting newborns and young children. It is characterized by a diffuse, tender, and erythematous rash, often accompanied by fever and irritability. The skin becomes fragile and prone to blistering, which can lead to widespread skin loss. The Nikolsky's sign, which is a positive result when gentle pressure causes the skin to separate and blister, is a hallmark of SSS.

The other options can be ruled out based on the following reasons:

A. Scarlet fever is typically associated with a sandpaper-like rash, which is not described in this scenario.

C. Impetigo is a superficial skin infection that typically presents with crusting and oozing lesions, which are not mentioned in this case.

D. Erysipela is a bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissues, often caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. While it can cause erythema and blistering, it is typically more localized and does not typically affect the skin in a diffuse manner like SSS.

E. Pyoderma is a general term for a skin infection, but it is not a specific diagnosis that fits the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

In summary, the combination of fever, irritability, generalized erythema, blisters, and a positive Nikolsky's sign points to a diagnosis of scalded skin syndrome (B).",Success
"A 60-year-old woman presents to the outpatient clinic complaining of severe vulvar itching that has been gradually worsening for the past year. She mentions that she has tried over-the-counter lubricants, but lubricants do not seem to provide substantial relief. Her medical history is remarkable for diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. Menopause occurred at 52 years of age. She has been sexually active with her husband until recently and reports severe pain during vaginal intercourse. The physical examination reveals dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area with atrophy of the labia minora. The clitoris appears retracted. The perianal skin appears pale and wrinkled. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Lichen sclerosus.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with lichen sclerosus, a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that affects the anogenital area. The presence of dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area, atrophy of the labia minora, and a retracted clitoris are all characteristic features of lichen sclerosus. Additionally, the pale and wrinkled appearance of the perianal skin is also consistent with this diagnosis.

Lichen sclerosus is a common condition that affects postmenopausal women, and it is often associated with vaginal dryness, itching, and pain during sexual intercourse. The patient's history of menopause and sexual activity until recently, as well as her complaint of severe pain during vaginal intercourse, further support this diagnosis.

Squamous cell hyperplasia (Option A) is a benign condition that can cause vulvar itching and discomfort, but it typically presents with thickened, white, or grayish lesions, rather than the thin, white plaque-like lesions seen in this patient.

Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva (Option C) is a type of cancer that can occur in the vulvar region, but it typically presents with a mass or ulcer, rather than the diffuse, plaque-like lesions seen in this patient.

Lichen planus (Option D) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can affect the vulvar area, but it typically presents with purple, flat-topped papules or plaques, rather than the white, plaque-like lesions seen in this patient.

Atrophic vaginitis (Option E) is a condition that occurs in postmenopausal women due to estrogen deficiency, leading to vaginal dryness and atrophy. While this patient may have some degree of atrophic vaginitis, the physical examination findings are more consistent with lichen sclerosus.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is lichen sclerosus.",Success
"A 50-year-old woman with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) presents to your clinic with complaints of left eye pain and reduced vision. She notes that she was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to presentation when she noticed some mild tenderness around her left eye, unrelieved by any pain relievers. This morning when she woke up she was unable to see out of her left eye and made an appointment to come see you. Other than SLE, her medical history is unremarkable. She has had no additional symptoms other than pain and vision loss. Her vital signs are all within normal limits. On exam, she has no vision in her left eye, but 20/30 visual acuity in her right eye. When you shine a light in her left eye there is no response. What response would you expect when you shine a light in her right eye?",B,"The correct answer is A. Bilateral mydriasis.

Here's why:

The patient presents with sudden vision loss in the left eye, which suggests a possible optic nerve problem. The absence of pupillary response to light in the left eye (amaurotic pupil) is a strong indicator of optic nerve damage or dysfunction. In a normal pupillary light reflex, shining a light in one eye causes both pupils to constrict (miosis). However, in this case, the left eye is not responding to light, indicating that the optic nerve is not transmitting the signal.

When you shine a light in the right eye, you would expect both pupils to dilate (mydriasis) because the pupillary light reflex is disrupted due to the damaged optic nerve in the left eye. This is known as the ""consensual response,"" where the unaffected eye's pupil responds to light, but the affected eye's pupil does not.

Therefore, option A, bilateral mydriasis, is the correct response. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they suggest constriction of the pupils, which would not occur in this scenario. Option E is also incorrect because the left eye's pupil is already dilated due to the lack of response to light.",Success
"A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain. She states that she was walking up the stairs at work when she felt sudden and severe abdominal pain followed by nausea and vomiting. Her past medical history is non-contributory and she is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.7°F (37.6°C), blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of abdominal tenderness, a left adnexal mass, and left adnexal tenderness. A transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates free fluid surrounding the ovary with edema and the presence of doppler flow. A urinary pregnancy test is negative. The patient's symptoms persisted after ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Laparoscopy.

Here's why:

The patient presents with sudden and severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which are concerning symptoms for a potential surgical emergency. The physical exam reveals a left adnexal mass and tenderness, suggesting a possible ovarian pathology. The transvaginal ultrasound shows free fluid surrounding the ovary with edema and the presence of Doppler flow, which is consistent with ovarian torsion.

Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency that requires prompt intervention to prevent ovarian necrosis and potential infertility. The patient's symptoms persisting after pain management with ibuprofen and acetaminophen further supports the need for surgical intervention.

Laparoscopy is the best next step in management because it allows for a minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Laparoscopy can help to confirm the diagnosis of ovarian torsion, and if confirmed, the surgeon can perform a detorsion procedure to restore blood flow to the ovary.

CT scan of the abdomen (Option A) is not the best choice because it may not provide the necessary diagnostic information for ovarian torsion, and it would delay surgical intervention.

Laparotomy (Option C) is a more invasive surgical approach that may be necessary if the patient's condition deteriorates or if laparoscopy is not feasible. However, laparoscopy is generally the preferred initial approach.

MRI of the pelvis (Option D) is not a suitable choice because it may not provide the necessary diagnostic information in a timely manner, and it may not be readily available in an emergency setting.

Observation and serial abdominal exams (Option E) are not appropriate because ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency that requires prompt intervention to prevent complications.

In summary, laparoscopy is the best next step in management because it allows for a timely and minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic approach to address the suspected ovarian torsion.",Success
"A 65-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressively worsening fatigue for 6 months. During this time, he has also had shortness of breath and palpitations on exertion. He has noticed blood in his stools on three separate occasions in the past 4 months. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease. He drinks two to four beers daily. He does not smoke. His pulse is 95/min and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Examination shows pale conjunctivae. The abdomen is soft with no organomegaly. Rectal examination is unremarkable. His hemoglobin concentration is 7.2 g/dL, hematocrit is 32%, and mean corpuscular volume is 68 μm3. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's bleeding?",E,"The correct answer is E. Arteriovenous malformation in the colonic wall.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, including fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations, are consistent with anemia. The physical examination reveals pale conjunctivae, which is a sign of anemia. The laboratory results show a low hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit, confirming the diagnosis of anemia. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 68 μm3, which is low, indicating microcytic anemia.

The patient's history of blood in the stools suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, which is the likely cause of the anemia. Given the patient's age, symptoms, and laboratory results, the most likely underlying cause of the bleeding is an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the colonic wall.

AVMs are abnormal connections between arteries and veins that can occur in the colon and can cause recurrent bleeding, leading to anemia. The patient's age and the presence of other comorbidities, such as diabetes and end-stage renal disease, increase the likelihood of AVMs.

The other options are less likely:

A. Dilated submucosal veins in the lower third of the esophagus are more commonly associated with portal hypertension and esophageal varices, which are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

B. Inflammation in an outpouching of the colonic wall (diverticulitis) can cause bleeding, but it is less likely to cause recurrent bleeding and anemia.

C. Symptomatic enlargement of hemorrhoidal plexus (hemorrhoids) can cause bleeding, but it is typically associated with bright red blood per rectum, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

D. Chronic mucosal and submucosal inflammation of the colon (inflammatory bowel disease) can cause bleeding, but it is less likely to cause recurrent bleeding and anemia in the absence of other symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and medical history, the most likely underlying cause of the bleeding is an arteriovenous malformation in the colonic wall.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with her boyfriend 2 hours after an episode of loss of consciousness. She was seated and was being tattooed on her right upper flank when she became diaphoretic, pale, and passed out. According to her boyfriend, the patient slipped to the floor and her arms and legs moved in a jerky fashion for a few seconds. She regained consciousness within half a minute and was alert and fully oriented immediately. She has no history of serious illness. She works as an event manager and has had more stress than usual due to a recent concert tour. She appears well. Her temperature is 37°C (98.4°F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 120/72 mm Hg. Her cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows an incomplete right bundle branch block. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Vasovagal syncope.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as becoming diaphoretic, pale, and passing out, are consistent with vasovagal syncope. Vasovagal syncope, also known as the common faint, is a common cause of loss of consciousness. It occurs when the nerves that regulate heart rate and blood pressure become overactive, leading to a sudden drop in blood pressure, causing a decrease in blood flow to the brain.

The patient's episode occurred while she was seated, which makes orthostatic syncope (option B) less likely. Orthostatic syncope typically occurs when standing up from a lying or sitting position, causing a sudden drop in blood pressure.

The patient's brief, jerky movements of her arms and legs, as reported by her boyfriend, could be mistaken for a seizure (option C). However, the fact that she regained consciousness within half a minute and was alert and fully oriented immediately afterwards makes a seizure less likely. Seizures are typically followed by a postictal state, which can last from minutes to hours.

The ECG finding of an incomplete right bundle branch block is a common benign variant and is not a cause of loss of consciousness. Therefore, options D and E, cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac structural abnormality, are unlikely.

Vasovagal syncope is often triggered by emotional stress, pain, or medical procedures, which fits with the patient's recent stress due to a concert tour and the tattooing procedure. The patient's lack of any significant medical history and normal physical examination also support this diagnosis.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical examination, vasovagal syncope is the most likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department 1 hour after falling from his bicycle. The boy was racing with his cousin when he lost control and fell onto his right side. He has nausea and severe pain in the right shoulder. He is in acute distress. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Examination shows swelling and tenderness over the right clavicle and pain exacerbated by movement; range of motion is limited. The skin over the clavicle is intact. The radial pulse in the right arm is intact. Sensory examination of the right upper limb shows no abnormalities. An x‑ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's shoulder?",C,"The correct answer is C. Apply a simple shoulder sling.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a clavicle fracture, which is a common injury in falls onto the shoulder. The x-ray of the chest likely shows a fracture of the right clavicle. The patient's vital signs are stable, and there are no signs of neurovascular compromise or other life-threatening injuries.

The most appropriate next step in management is to immobilize the shoulder with a simple shoulder sling to reduce pain and promote healing. This is a standard treatment for clavicle fractures, as it allows the bone to heal in a stable position and reduces the risk of further injury.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Tension banding is a surgical procedure used to treat certain types of fractures, but it is not necessary for a simple clavicle fracture.

B. Applying a clavicular plate is a surgical intervention that may be necessary for more complex clavicle fractures, but it is not the initial management for a patient with a simple fracture.

D. An MRI of the right shoulder is not necessary at this point, as the diagnosis of a clavicle fracture can be made with a plain x-ray, and an MRI would not change the initial management.

E. Arteriography is an invasive procedure used to diagnose vascular injuries, but there is no indication of vascular compromise in this patient, and it is not necessary at this point.

It's worth noting that the patient should be monitored for any signs of complications, such as respiratory distress or neurovascular compromise, and further imaging or surgical intervention may be necessary if the patient's condition worsens or if the fracture is more complex than initially thought. However, the initial management should focus on immobilization and pain control with a simple shoulder sling.",Success
"A 51-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of a 3-week history of abnormal behavior. His wife reports he has been preoccupied with gambling at the local casino. He becomes restless and irritable when his wife attempts to restrict his gambling. Four months ago, he was diagnosed with Parkinson disease and treatment was initiated. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed for this patient?",C,"The correct answer is B. Increase in availability of dopamine.

The patient's symptoms of abnormal behavior, specifically the preoccupation with gambling, suggest an impulse control disorder, which is a known side effect of dopamine replacement therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease.

The most likely medication prescribed for this patient is levodopa (L-dopa), a precursor to dopamine that is converted to dopamine in the brain. Levodopa increases the availability of dopamine in the brain, which helps to alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia.

The other options are not directly related to the mechanism of action of levodopa:

A. Peripheral inhibition of DOPA decarboxylase is the mechanism of action of carbidopa, a medication that is often combined with levodopa to prevent its peripheral conversion to dopamine.

C. Direct activation of dopamine receptors is the mechanism of action of dopamine agonists, such as pramipexole or ropinirole, which are used to treat Parkinson's disease, but are not the most likely medication prescribed in this scenario.

D. Selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase B is the mechanism of action of selegiline, a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease, but it is not directly related to the increase in dopamine availability.

E. Inhibition of catechol-O-methyl transferase is the mechanism of action of entacapone, a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease, but it is not the most likely medication prescribed in this scenario.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Increase in availability of dopamine.",Success
"A 55-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presents to her primary care doctor with fever, fatigue, and bleeding gums for the past 3 days. She denies any sick contacts.

A bone marrow biopsy demonstrates 34% myeloblasts with Auer rods that are myeloperoxidase positive. What is best treatment option?",D,"The correct answer is D. Retinoic acid.

The patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and laboratory results are consistent with Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL). The presence of Auer rods in the bone marrow biopsy and the myeloperoxidase positivity confirm the diagnosis.

APL is a subtype of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) that is characterized by a specific genetic translocation, t(15;17), which leads to the formation of the PML-RARα fusion protein. This protein inhibits differentiation and apoptosis of promyelocytes, leading to their accumulation in the bone marrow and peripheral blood.

Retinoic acid, specifically all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), is a key component of the treatment of APL. ATRA binds to the PML-RARα fusion protein, causing it to undergo proteasomal degradation, which leads to the differentiation of promyelocytes into mature neutrophils. ATRA is typically used in combination with chemotherapy, such as anthracyclines, to induce remission in APL patients.

The other options are not directly related to the treatment of APL:

A. Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is not a treatment for APL.

B. Cryoprecipitate is a blood product that may be used to treat bleeding disorders, but it is not a treatment for APL.

C. Fresh frozen plasma may be used to correct coagulopathy, but it is not a specific treatment for APL.

E. Zoledronic acid is a bisphosphonate used to treat bone metastases and hypercalcemia, but it is not a treatment for APL.

It's worth noting that the patient's laboratory results also suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which may require supportive care, such as blood product transfusions and anticoagulation therapy. However, the primary treatment focus should be on inducing remission of the APL with ATRA and chemotherapy.",Success
"A 30-year-old man presents to the emergency room complaining of malaise. Two hours prior to presentation, he developed muscle cramps and nausea.

On exam, he demonstrates sensitivity to bright light. He is tired-appearing but alert and fully oriented. A stool sample and culture demonstrates abundant non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-negative, and H2S-producing gram-negative bacilli. The pathogen responsible for this patient’s condition relies on a virulence factor with which of the following mechanisms of action?",C,"The correct answer is C. Blocking antibody attack on the O antigen.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest an infection with Salmonella, a gram-negative bacillus that is commonly found in reptiles and can be transmitted to humans through contact with contaminated feces or surfaces.

The virulence factor responsible for Salmonella's ability to evade the host immune system is the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O antigen, which is a component of the bacterial cell wall. The O antigen is a key target for the host's immune response, and Salmonella has evolved mechanisms to evade this response.

One of these mechanisms is the production of a virulence factor that blocks antibody attack on the O antigen. This factor, known as O-antigen capsule, is a polysaccharide layer that surrounds the bacterial cell and prevents antibodies from binding to the O antigen, thereby reducing the host's ability to recognize and eliminate the bacteria.

The other options are not correct:

A. ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2 is a mechanism of action of the virulence factor Exotoxin A, produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

B. Binding the Fc region of host immunoglobulins is a mechanism of action of the virulence factor Protein A, produced by Staphylococcus aureus.

D. Cleaving immunoglobulin A molecules is a mechanism of action of the virulence factor IgA protease, produced by several bacterial species, including Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae.

E. Cleaving lecithin is a mechanism of action of the virulence factor alpha-toxin, produced by Clostridium perfringens.

Attention and concentration are impaired. He recalls only one of three objects after 5 minutes. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Ventricular shunting.

The patient's symptoms, including difficulties walking, urinary urgency, incontinence, decreased appetite, and cognitive impairment (inattention, impaired attention and concentration, and memory loss), are consistent with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH). NPH is a condition characterized by the gradual accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to ventricular enlargement and increased pressure, despite normal cerebrospinal fluid pressure measurements.

The patient's gait disturbance, specifically the broad-based gait with slow and short steps, is a hallmark feature of NPH. The other symptoms, such as urinary incontinence, cognitive impairment, and decreased appetite, are also common in NPH.

Ventricular shunting is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms. Shunting involves surgically inserting a device to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid from the ventricles, which can help alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient's symptoms:

B. Acetazolamide therapy is used to treat conditions such as mountain sickness, epilepsy, and glaucoma, but it is not indicated for NPH.

C. Temporal lobectomy is a surgical procedure used to treat epilepsy, but it is not relevant to this patient's symptoms.

D. Donepezil therapy is used to treat Alzheimer's disease, but it is not effective for NPH.

E. Sertraline therapy is an antidepressant medication, but it is not indicated for NPH or the patient's symptoms.

It's essential to note that a definitive diagnosis of NPH typically requires additional testing, such as imaging studies (e.g., MRI or CT scans), lumbar puncture, and neuropsychological evaluations. However, based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, ventricular shunting is the most appropriate therapy to consider.",Success
"A 40-year-old woman with Down syndrome comes to the physician for the evaluation of fatigue, progressive clumsiness when using her hands, and difficulty walking for 3 months.

She has not had any trauma or weight changes. She lives with her sister and works as a cashier in a local retail store. She takes no medications. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person and place only. There is moderate weakness of the upper and lower extremities. Sensory examination shows no abnormalities. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Babinski's sign is present bilaterally. Which of the following would most likely improve this patient's symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Surgical fusion of C1/C2.

The patient's symptoms, including progressive clumsiness, difficulty walking, dizziness, double vision, and loss of bladder control, suggest a diagnosis of atlanto-axial instability (AAI), which is a common condition in individuals with Down syndrome. AAI occurs when there is excessive movement between the atlas (C1) and axis (C2) vertebrae, leading to compression of the spinal cord.

The patient's physical examination findings, including moderate weakness of the upper and lower extremities, bilateral Babinski's sign, and normal sensory examination, are consistent with spinal cord compression. The presence of Babinski's sign, a pathological reflex, indicates upper motor neuron involvement, which is consistent with spinal cord compression.

Surgical fusion of C1/C2 (option B) is the most likely intervention to improve the patient's symptoms. This procedure aims to stabilize the atlanto-axial joint, reducing the compression on the spinal cord and alleviating the patient's symptoms.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and diagnosis:

A. Botulism antitoxin is used to treat botulism, a rare bacterial infection, which is not related to the patient's symptoms.

C. Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid used to treat various conditions, including multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries. While it may be used to reduce inflammation and swelling in the spinal cord, it is not a specific treatment for atlanto-axial instability.

"A 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus is brought to her primary care doctor by her son who is concerned about the patient's ability to manage her activities of daily living. She has been living alone since her husband passed away 2 years ago. She has remained an active member of her retirement community's wine club; however, she stopped attending the meetings 3 weeks ago. She is generally able to her maintain her house, but her house appears more disorganized over the past 2 weeks. She generally drives short distances but avoids driving long distances as she occasionally gets lost when navigating new areas. She feels like her balance is getting worse, but she has not fallen.

She does not seem to recognize her doctor despite knowing him for many years. She becomes somnolent intermittently throughout the interview. She can recall 0/3 words after 5 minutes. She has a low-frequency tremor in her right arm that increases in severity with deliberate movement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is C. Lewy body dementia.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with Lewy body dementia (LBD). The key features that support this diagnosis are:

1. Cognitive impairment: The patient is disoriented to place and situation, has difficulty recalling words, and becomes somnolent intermittently, indicating significant cognitive decline.
2. Fluctuating cognitive status: The patient's ability to attend wine club meetings and maintain her house, although with some difficulty, suggests that her cognitive status can fluctuate.
3. Visual hallucinations or delusions: Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient's lack of recognition of her doctor, despite knowing him for many years, may indicate the presence of visual hallucinations or delusions, which are common in LBD.
4. Motor symptoms: The low-frequency tremor in her right arm, which increases in severity with deliberate movement, is consistent with parkinsonian symptoms, which are often seen in LBD.
5. Autonomic dysfunction: The patient's urinary urgency and incontinence episodes suggest autonomic dysfunction, which is common in LBD.

While Alzheimer dementia (Option A) is a possibility, the patient's fluctuating cognitive status, parkinsonian symptoms, and autonomic dysfunction make LBD a more likely diagnosis.

Delirium (Option B) is unlikely because the patient's symptoms have been present for several weeks, and delirium typically has a more acute onset.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (Option D) is possible, given the patient's urinary incontinence and gait instability, but the presence of cognitive impairment, fluctuating cognitive status, and parkinsonian symptoms make LBD a more likely diagnosis.

Pseudodementia (Option E) is not a valid diagnosis, as it is a outdated term that was previously used to describe depression-related cognitive impairment. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with a neurodegenerative disorder like LBD.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of anxiety, use of multiple medications, and excessive wine consumption may be contributing factors to her symptoms, but they do not explain the full range of her symptoms. A thorough diagnostic evaluation, including imaging studies and neuropsychological testing, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of LBD.",Success

The patient presents with uncontrolled hypertension, and the physician adds another anti-hypertensive medication to the regimen. One month later, the patient develops lower extremity swelling, which is a common side effect of calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Verapamil, a CCB, is known to cause peripheral edema due to its vasodilatory effects.

The other options are less likely to cause peripheral edema:

A. Metoprolol is a beta blocker, which may cause fatigue, dizziness, or bradycardia, but it is not typically associated with peripheral edema.

C. Nifedipine is a dihydropyridine CCB, which can also cause peripheral edema, but it is less likely to be prescribed in combination with enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, due to the risk of hypotension.

D. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic, which would actually help reduce fluid retention and edema, making it an unlikely cause of the patient's symptoms.

E. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can cause hyperkalemia, but it is not typically associated with peripheral edema.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the medication classes, verapamil (B) is the most likely culprit causing the lower extremity swelling.",Success
"A 29-year-old woman comes to the physician with high-grade fever, headache, and muscle pain. A week ago, she returned from India, where she was working with an NGO to build houses in rural areas. The patient took one dose of chloroquine one week before her trip. She also took a further dose during her trip. She has no history of a serious illness. Her temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 112/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows jaundice. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 10 g/dL and a blood smear shows fragmented erythrocytes and occasional ring-shaped inclusion bodies within erythrocytes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of infection in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Plasmodium falciparum.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as high-grade fever, headache, and muscle pain, are consistent with malaria.
* The patient's travel history to India, a malaria-endemic area, increases the likelihood of malaria.
* The patient took only one dose of chloroquine before her trip and another dose during her trip, which is insufficient for adequate prophylaxis against malaria.
* The physical examination finding of jaundice suggests hemolysis, which is a common feature of malaria.
* The laboratory findings of fragmented erythrocytes and occasional ring-shaped inclusion bodies within erythrocytes on the blood smear are characteristic of Plasmodium falciparum infection.
* Plasmodium falciparum is the most severe and deadly form of malaria, and it is common in India.

The other options are less likely:

* A. Plasmodium ovale is a type of malaria, but it is less common in India and typically causes a milder form of the disease.
* C. Dengue virus can cause fever, headache, and muscle pain, but it is not typically associated with jaundice or hemolysis.
* D. Chikungunya virus can cause fever, headache, and muscle pain, but it is not typically associated with jaundice or hemolysis, and it is not commonly found in India.
* E. Hepatitis A virus can cause jaundice, but it is not typically associated with fever, headache, and muscle pain, and it is not commonly associated with hemolysis or ring-shaped inclusion bodies on a blood smear.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Plasmodium falciparum is the most common cause of malaria in India, and it is responsible for the majority of malaria-related deaths worldwide.",Success
"A 39-year-old woman presents to the clinic for her annual physical. Although she feels generally healthy she has noticed gaining about 9 kg (20 lb) over the last year. She eats a healthy, varied diet and exercises at the gym 4 days a week, including 20 minutes of aerobic exercise. On further questioning, she has also noted fatigue and constipation. She denies shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, or blood in her stool. At the clinic, the vital signs include: pulse 52/min, blood pressure 110/72 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. The physical exam is notable only for slightly dry skin. The complete blood count (CBC) is within normal limits. Which of the following laboratory values is most likely elevated in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

The patient's symptoms of weight gain, fatigue, and constipation, along with her physical exam finding of dry skin, suggest hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, leading to a range of symptoms.

The patient's normal complete blood count (CBC) and vital signs help to rule out other potential causes of her symptoms, such as anemia or cardiovascular disease.

In hypothyroidism, the pituitary gland produces more thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in an effort to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones. Therefore, an elevated TSH level is a hallmark of hypothyroidism.

The other options are not as likely to be elevated in this patient:

A. Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production and is not directly related to thyroid function.

B. Glucose levels may be affected by thyroid function, but an elevated glucose level is not a primary indicator of hypothyroidism.

C. Triiodothyronine (T3) is a thyroid hormone that may be decreased in hypothyroidism, but an elevated T3 level is not typically seen in this condition.

D. Thyroxine (T4) is another thyroid hormone that may be decreased in hypothyroidism, but an elevated T4 level is not typically seen in this condition.

According to current medical guidelines, an elevated TSH level is a sensitive and specific indicator of hypothyroidism, and it is often the first test ordered to evaluate thyroid function.",Success
"A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of persistent diarrhea and fatigue for 1 month. She has had up to 12 watery stools per day. Sometimes she awakens at night because she has to defecate. She has abdominal bloating and cramps. She has had a 2-kg weight loss in the past month. She returned from a trip to Costa Rica 7 weeks ago. She has a history of bronchial asthma and bulimia nervosa. She works as a nurse. She does not smoke and drinks 1–2 beers on the weekend. Current medications include fish oil, a multivitamin, and a salbutamol inhaler. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. Abdominal and rectal examinations are unremarkable. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 46%
Leukocyte Count 6,500/mm3
Platelet Count 220,000/mm3
Serum
Na+ 136 mEq/L
K+ 3.2 mEq/L
Cl- 102 mEq/L
HCO3- 33 mEq/L
Mg2+ 3.3 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen 14 mg/dL
Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL
Abdominal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Colonoscopy shows dark colored mucosa with interspersed white spots. Biopsies of colonic mucosa are obtained and sent for pathological evaluation. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?""",E,"The correct answer is C. VIPoma.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, such as persistent diarrhea, fatigue, abdominal bloating, and cramps, are consistent with a gastrointestinal disorder. The laboratory results show hypokalemia (low potassium levels), which is a key feature of VIPoma (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide-secreting tumor).

VIPoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that secretes excessive amounts of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), leading to a characteristic syndrome of watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria (decreased stomach acid production). The patient's symptoms, including frequent watery stools, nocturnal diarrhea, and weight loss, are consistent with this diagnosis.

The colonoscopy findings of dark-colored mucosa with interspersed white spots are also consistent with VIPoma, as the tumor can cause mucosal hyperpigmentation and edema.

While celiac disease (Option A) can cause diarrhea and weight loss, it is unlikely to cause hypokalemia. Carcinoid tumor (Option B) can cause diarrhea, but it is typically associated with flushing, wheezing, and cardiac symptoms, which are not present in this patient. Irritable bowel syndrome (Option D) is a diagnosis of exclusion, and the patient's symptoms are more severe and specific than those typically seen in IBS. Medication abuse (Option E) is unlikely, given the patient's occupation as a nurse and the lack of any suspicious medication history.

In conclusion, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and colonoscopy findings, VIPoma is the most likely underlying cause of her symptoms.",Success
"A 21-year-old college student comes to the physician because of daytime fatigue for 2 months. He has problems getting to sleep at night and frequently falls asleep during class. Recently he has started skipping classes altogether. He goes to bed between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. but cannot fall asleep for 2–3 hours. When he wakes up at 8:30 a.m., he feels extremely drowsy, and he tries to overcome his fatigue by drinking 2–3 cups of coffee a day. He naps at various times during the afternoon, often for more than an hour. He stopped watching videos on his smartphone at night because of suggestions from his peers. He states that he has tried over-the-counter melatonin pills and exercising at 8 p.m. without success. He has no history of serious illness. He does not smoke. He drinks three to five beers on weekends. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient?",C,"The correct answer is B. Complete caffeine cessation.

This patient is experiencing daytime fatigue, difficulty falling asleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness, which are all symptoms of insomnia. The patient's habits, such as consuming 2-3 cups of coffee a day and napping for over an hour, are likely contributing to his insomnia.

Caffeine is a stimulant that can interfere with sleep quality and duration. Consuming caffeine in the afternoon or evening can disrupt sleep patterns and make it difficult to fall asleep. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends that adults avoid consuming caffeine in the afternoon and evening to promote better sleep.

The other options are not appropriate recommendations for this patient:

A. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that can cause drowsiness, but it is not a recommended treatment for insomnia. In fact, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends against using antihistamines as a treatment for insomnia due to their potential side effects and lack of efficacy.

C. Exercising at 8 p.m. is not likely to be contributing to the patient's insomnia, as exercise can actually help improve sleep quality. The timing of exercise is not as important as the overall regularity and quality of sleep.

D. Consuming an alcoholic beverage before bedtime is not recommended, as alcohol can disrupt sleep patterns and reduce sleep quality.

E. Scheduled afternoon naps can be beneficial for some people, but in this patient's case, his naps are already excessive (over an hour) and may be contributing to his insomnia. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends that adults limit their naps to 20-30 minutes and avoid napping close to bedtime.

By stopping caffeine consumption, the patient may be able to improve the quality of his sleep and reduce his daytime fatigue.",Success
"A 19-year-old man is brought to the physician by his mother because she is worried about his strange behavior. Over the past 3 years, he has been dressing all in black and wears a long black coat, even in the summer. The mother reports that her son has always had difficulties fitting in. He does not have any friends and spends most of his time in his room playing online games. He is anxious at college because he is uncomfortable around other people, and his academic performance is poor. Rather than doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons. He says that he has never seen any demons, but sometimes there are signs of their presence. For example, a breeze in an enclosed room is likely the “breath of a demon”. Mental status examination shows laborious speech. The patient avoids eye contact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Schizotypal personality disorder.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms and behavior are consistent with schizotypal personality disorder, which is a Cluster A personality disorder characterized by eccentric behavior, odd speech, and magical thinking. The patient's:

* Eccentric behavior: dressing all in black, wearing a long black coat, and being preoccupied with paranormal phenomena, especially demons
* Odd speech: laborious speech and attributing natural phenomena (e.g., a breeze in an enclosed room) to supernatural causes (e.g., ""breath of a demon"")
* Magical thinking: believing in the presence of demons and interpreting events as signs of their presence
* Social isolation: having difficulties fitting in, not having friends, and spending most of his time alone in his room
* Avoidance of eye contact: indicating social anxiety and discomfort around others

While the patient may also exhibit some symptoms of social anxiety disorder (A), such as anxiety in college and avoidance of social situations, the presence of magical thinking and eccentric behavior points more towards schizotypal personality disorder.

Avoidant personality disorder (B) is also a possibility, but the patient's eccentric behavior and magical thinking are more characteristic of schizotypal personality disorder.

Paranoid personality disorder (D) is unlikely, as the patient does not exhibit suspiciousness or mistrust of others.

Schizophrenia (E) is also unlikely, as the patient does not exhibit any psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions. His beliefs about demons are more indicative of magical thinking than a true delusional system.

It's essential to note that a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including a thorough psychological assessment and potentially, a longitudinal observation, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",Success
"A 79-year-old man presents to the office due to shortness of breath with moderate exertion and a slightly productive cough. He has a medical history of 25 years of heavy smoking. His vitals include: heart rate 89/min, respiratory rate 27/min, and blood pressure 120/90 mm Hg. The physical exam shows increased resonance to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and crackles at the lung base. Chest radiography shows signs of pulmonary hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) of 48%, a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 85%, and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 56%. According to these results, what is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical exam findings are consistent with COPD. The patient is a heavy smoker, which is a significant risk factor for COPD. The physical exam shows signs of lung hyperinflation, such as increased resonance to percussion and decreased breath sounds, which are characteristic of COPD. The presence of crackles at the lung base suggests airway obstruction.

The spirometry results also support the diagnosis of COPD. The FEV1/FVC ratio of 56% is below the normal range of 70%, indicating airflow obstruction. The FEV1 of 48% is also consistent with moderate to severe airflow obstruction, which is a hallmark of COPD.

Asthma (Option A) is less likely because the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are more consistent with COPD. While asthma can also cause airflow obstruction, the patient's age, smoking history, and physical exam findings make COPD a more likely diagnosis.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (Option B) is a rare lung disease that typically affects women and is characterized by cystic changes in the lungs. The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Bronchiectasis (Option D) is a chronic lung disease characterized by dilated airways, which can cause a productive cough. However, the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are more consistent with COPD, and the spirometry results do not suggest bronchiectasis.

Heart failure (Option E) is unlikely because the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are more consistent with a lung disease, and the chest radiography shows signs of pulmonary hyperinflation, which is not typically seen in heart failure.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, physical exam findings, and spirometry results, the most likely diagnosis is COPD.",Success
