"A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?",B,"The correct answer is A. Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report.

As a healthcare professional, it is essential to maintain transparency and honesty in patient care. Failing to disclose a complication, even if it is minor, can be considered unethical and may lead to mistrust between the patient and the healthcare team.

The American Medical Association (AMA) Code of Medical Ethics states that ""physicians have an ethical obligation to inform patients of the risks and benefits of treatment, as well as any complications that may arise during or after treatment."" (AMA Code of Medical Ethics, Opinion 8.12)

By disclosing the error to the patient and including it in the operative report, the resident is:

1. Upholding the principle of transparency and honesty in patient care.
2. Respecting the patient's autonomy and right to know about their medical condition.
3. Maintaining accurate and complete medical records.
4. Demonstrating accountability and a commitment to quality care.

While it may be uncomfortable to disclose an error, it is essential to prioritize the patient's well-being and trust over concerns about worrying the patient or avoiding potential consequences.",Success
A 67-year-old man with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of ringing sensation in his ear. He received this first course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 week ago. Pure tone audiometry shows a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB. The expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to which of the following actions?,D,"A medical question!

Based on the symptoms described, I believe the correct answer is C. Generation of free radicals.

Here's my reasoning:

The patient is experiencing a ringing sensation in his ear (tinnitus) and has a sensorineural hearing loss, which suggests ototoxicity (damage to the inner ear or auditory nerve). This is a known side effect of certain chemotherapeutic agents, particularly cisplatin, which is commonly used to treat transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.

Cisplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapy drug that works by generating free radicals, which damage cancer cells by binding to DNA and causing DNA cross-linking. However, this mechanism of action can also lead to damage to healthy cells, including those in the inner ear, resulting in ototoxicity.

The other options are not directly related to the symptoms described:

A. Inhibition of proteasome is a mechanism of action of proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib, which are used to treat certain types of cancer, but are not typically associated with ototoxicity.

B. Hyperstabilization of microtubules is a mechanism of action of taxanes, such as paclitaxel, which are used to treat various types of cancer, but are not typically associated with ototoxicity.

D. Cross-linking of DNA is a mechanism of action of alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide, which are used to treat various types of cancer, but are not typically associated with ototoxicity.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Generation of free radicals.",Success
"Two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catherization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man has decreased urinary output and malaise.

He was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Examination shows mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin count 14 g/dL

Urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL
Creatinine 4.2 mg/dL
Renal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?""",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely cause of his symptoms is:

B. Cholesterol embolization

Here's why:

* The patient underwent cardiac catheterization with stenting, which increases the risk of cholesterol embolization.
* The patient's symptoms, such as decreased urinary output and malaise, are consistent with acute kidney injury.
* The laboratory results show elevated serum creatinine and urea nitrogen, indicating renal dysfunction.
* The renal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles, which are characteristic of cholesterol emboli.
* The patient's physical examination shows mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet, which is a classic sign of cholesterol embolization syndrome.
* The patient's eosinophilia (11% eosinophils) is also consistent with cholesterol embolization syndrome.

Cholesterol embolization occurs when plaque fragments from the aorta or other arteries break off and travel to smaller arteries, causing occlusion and tissue ischemia. This can lead to acute kidney injury, as seen in this patient.

The other options are less likely:

A. Renal papillary necrosis is a condition that typically occurs in patients with diabetes and is characterized by necrosis of the renal papillae. While the patient has diabetes, the renal biopsy findings do not support this diagnosis.

C. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a rare condition characterized by eosinophilia, granulomas, and vasculitis. While the patient has eosinophilia, the other features of this condition are not present.

D. Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis that can cause renal dysfunction, but it is less likely in this patient given the characteristic renal biopsy findings and the patient's recent cardiac catheterization.",Success
"A 39-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of fevers, chills, and left lower quadrant pain.

When phenol is applied to a sample of the patient's blood at 90°C, a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain is identified. A blood culture is most likely to show which of the following?""",D,"A fascinating case!

Let's break down the clues:

1. The patient presents with fever, chills, and left lower quadrant pain, suggesting a possible infection.
2. The pelvic examination reveals mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os and left adnexal tenderness, pointing towards a genital tract infection.
3. The laboratory studies show:
	* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
	* Hypofibrinogenemia (low fibrinogen level)
	* Elevated D-dimer level, indicating disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
4. The phenol test result suggests the presence of lipoteichoic acid, a component of Gram-positive bacterial cell walls.
5. The description of the phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain is consistent with the teichoic acid of Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Considering these findings, the most likely answer is:

B. Encapsulated, gram-negative coccobacilli forming grey-colored colonies on charcoal blood agar

However, this option doesn't quite fit the description. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a Gram-positive bacterium, not Gram-negative.

The correct answer is not among the options provided. The correct answer would be Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a Gram-positive, encapsulated bacterium that can cause genital tract infections, sepsis, and DIC.

"A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of itchy, watery eyes for the past week. He has also been sneezing multiple times a day during this period. He had a similar episode 1 year ago around springtime. He has iron deficiency anemia and ankylosing spondylitis. Current medications include ferrous sulfate, artificial tear drops, and indomethacin. He works as an elementary school teacher. His vital signs are within normal limits. Visual acuity is 20/20 without correction. Physical examination shows bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge. The pupils are 3 mm, equal, and reactive to light. Examination of the anterior chamber of the eye is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",B,"Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination, the most appropriate treatment is:

B. Ketotifen eye drops

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms of itchy, watery eyes, and sneezing multiple times a day are consistent with allergic conjunctivitis, which is a common condition that occurs during springtime.
* The physical examination shows bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge, which further supports the diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis.
* Ketotifen eye drops are an antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer that can help relieve the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, such as itching, redness, and watery discharge.
* Erythromycin ointment (Option A) is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, which is not the likely diagnosis in this case.
* Warm compresses (Option C) may provide some relief from itching and discomfort, but they are not a specific treatment for allergic conjunctivitis.
* Fluorometholone eye drops (Option D) are a corticosteroid that can be used to treat inflammatory conditions of the eye, but they may not be necessary in this case, and they can have side effects such as increased intraocular pressure and cataract formation.

It's worth noting that the patient's medications, including ferrous sulfate, artificial tear drops, and indomethacin, are not likely to be contributing to his symptoms, and they do not need to be changed.",Success
A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of progressively worsening chest pain and nausea that started at a local bar 30 minutes prior. The pain radiates to the epigastric area. He has a 5-year history of untreated hypertension. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 5 years and started abusing cocaine 2 weeks before his emergency room visit. The patient is diaphoretic and in marked distress. What should be the first step in management?,D,"A classic case of a potential cardiac emergency!

Given the patient's symptoms, medical history, and recent cocaine abuse, the first step in management should be to suspect an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), such as a myocardial infarction (heart attack).

The correct answer is B. Labetalol.

Here's why:

* Labetalol is a beta-blocker that can help reduce the patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac workload, which can reduce the oxygen demand of the heart and alleviate symptoms.
* Beta-blockers are a key component of ACS management, and labetalol is a good choice in this scenario because it also has alpha-blocking properties, which can help counteract the vasoconstrictive effects of cocaine.
* Diltiazem (A) is a calcium channel blocker that can also be used in ACS, but it's not the best first choice in this scenario.
* Propranolol (C) is a non-selective beta-blocker that can exacerbate bronchospasm and is not ideal in this situation.
* Reassurance and continuous monitoring (D) are important, but they should come after the patient has received appropriate medical therapy to address their symptoms and potential ACS.

Of course, the patient should also receive an ECG, cardiac biomarkers, and other diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.",Success
A 68-year-old male comes to the physician for evaluation of right flank pain. He has a history of diabetes and peripheral artery disease. His blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows abdominal tenderness and right flank tenderness. An ultrasound shows dilation of the right ureter and renal pelvis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?,C,"Based on the patient's symptoms and ultrasound results, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is:

B. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms of right flank pain and abdominal tenderness suggest an obstruction in the urinary tract.
* The ultrasound finding of dilation of the right ureter and renal pelvis (hydronephrosis) supports this idea.
* Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition in older men, and it can cause urinary tract obstruction, leading to hydronephrosis.
* The patient's age (68) and lack of other symptoms or findings suggestive of other options (e.g., no mention of hypertension or kidney disease to suggest renal artery stenosis, no symptoms of aneurysm rupture or peripheral embolization to suggest common iliac artery aneurysm, and no symptoms of urinary retention or difficulty starting urination to suggest urethral stricture) make BPH the most likely cause.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of diabetes and peripheral artery disease may contribute to his overall health status, but they are not directly related to the underlying cause of his current symptoms.",Success
"A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after the onset of acute chest pain. He has hypertension and asthma. Current medications include atorvastatin, lisinopril, and an albuterol inhaler. He appears pale and diaphoretic. His pulse is 114/min and blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg. An ECG shows ST-segment depressions in leads II, III, and aVF. Laboratory studies show an increased serum troponin T concentration. The patient is treated for acute coronary syndrome and undergoes percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. At the time of discharge, echocardiography shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 58%. In addition to aspirin, which of the following drugs should be added to this patient's medication regimen?",C,"The correct answer is C. Clopidogrel.

Here's why:

* The patient has acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and has undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), which means they have a high risk of platelet activation and thrombosis.
* Aspirin is already being used, which is a good antiplatelet agent, but adding clopidogrel would provide additional antiplatelet effects and reduce the risk of stent thrombosis.
* The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (such as clopidogrel) for at least 12 months in patients with ACS who have undergone PTCA.

The other options are not correct because:

* A. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that may be used for hypertension or angina, but it is not specifically indicated for ACS or post-PTCA management.
* B. Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin that may be used for anticoagulation in ACS, but it is not typically used long-term after PTCA.
* D. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that may be used for heart failure or hypertension, but it is not specifically indicated for ACS or post-PTCA management. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 58% is relatively preserved, so spironolactone would not be indicated for heart failure at this time.",Success
"A 37-year-old-woman presents to her primary care physician requesting a new form of birth control. She has been utilizing oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for the past 8 years, but asks to switch to an intrauterine device (IUD). Her vital signs are: blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg, pulse 73/min and respiratory rate 16/min. She is afebrile. Physical examination is within normal limits. Which of the following past medical history statements would make copper IUD placement contraindicated in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Copper IUDs are contraindicated in women with active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) because the IUD can increase the risk of infection and worsen the condition. PID is an infection of the upper genital tract, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and can be caused by bacterial or other infections. Inserting an IUD in a woman with active or recurrent PID could push the infection further into the uterus and fallopian tubes, leading to serious complications.

The other options are not contraindications for copper IUD placement:

A. A history of stroke or venous thromboembolism is not a contraindication for copper IUD placement. However, it may be a contraindication for hormonal IUDs or combined oral contraceptive pills, which can increase the risk of thrombosis.

C. Past medical history of breast cancer is not a contraindication for copper IUD placement. Copper IUDs do not contain hormones, so they do not increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence.

D. Known liver neoplasm is not a contraindication for copper IUD placement. However, hormonal IUDs or combined oral contraceptive pills may be contraindicated in women with liver tumors or liver disease, as they can increase the risk of liver damage or worsen liver function.",Success
A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because she is embarrassed about the appearance of her nails. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She appears well. A photograph of the nails is shown. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?,A,"Based on the photograph of the nails, I'm going to take a educated guess.

The patient's nail appearance suggests a condition known as ""nail pitting,"" which is characterized by small depressions or pits on the surface of the nails.

Given this, I think the most likely additional finding in this patient is:

C. Erosions of the dental enamel

Nail pitting is a common feature of alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that can also cause hair loss. Another condition that can cause nail pitting is psoriasis. Both of these conditions can also cause enamel erosion on the teeth.

Here's why I ruled out the other options:

A. Silvery plaques on extensor surfaces are more characteristic of psoriasis, but nail pitting is not a primary feature of psoriasis.

B. Flesh-colored papules in the lumbosacral region are more indicative of keratosis pilaris, a benign skin condition that doesn't typically cause nail pitting.

D. Holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border is a cardiac finding, which doesn't seem related to the patient's nail appearance.

As part of the patient’s workup, she undergoes a series of rapid screening tests that result in the administration of zidovudine during delivery. The infant is also given zidovudine to reduce the risk of transmission. A confirmatory test is then performed in the mother to confirm the diagnosis of HIV. Which of the following is most true about the confirmatory test?",D,"The correct answer is D. It is an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay.

Here's why:

The patient underwent rapid screening tests, which likely included a rapid HIV test, such as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or a rapid immunochromatographic test. These tests detect the presence of HIV antibodies in the blood. Since the results were positive, the patient was given zidovudine during delivery, and the infant was also given zidovudine to reduce the risk of transmission.

A confirmatory test is then performed to confirm the diagnosis of HIV. In this case, the correct answer is D. It is an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay. This test is used to confirm the presence of HIV antibodies and to differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections.

The other options are incorrect because:

A. A Southern blot is a laboratory technique used to detect specific DNA sequences, but it is not typically used to diagnose HIV.

B. A Northern blot is a laboratory technique used to detect specific RNA sequences, but it is not typically used to diagnose HIV.

C. A Northern blot does not identify the presence of DNA; it identifies the presence of RNA.

The positive JAK2 assay supports this diagnosis.

The most appropriate next step in management is:

D. Ruxolitinib

Ruxolitinib is a JAK inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in reducing spleen size, alleviating symptoms, and improving quality of life in patients with PMF. It is a commonly used treatment for PMF, especially in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk disease.

Here's why the other options are not the most appropriate next step:

A. Cladribine is a chemotherapy agent that is not typically used as a first-line treatment for PMF.

B. Prednisone may be used to manage some symptoms, such as anemia or thrombocytopenia, but it is not a disease-modifying therapy for PMF.

C. Imatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is used to treat certain types of leukemia, but it is not typically used to treat PMF.

A 20-year-old man comes to the physician because of worsening gait unsteadiness and bilateral hearing loss for 1 month. He has had intermittent tingling sensations on both cheeks over this time period. He has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications. Audiometry shows bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Genetic evaluation shows a mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes merlin. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions?,B,"Based on the symptoms and genetic evaluation, the correct answer is B. Meningioma.

The patient's symptoms, such as worsening gait unsteadiness, bilateral hearing loss, and intermittent tingling sensations on both cheeks, are consistent with a neurological disorder. The genetic evaluation reveals a mutation of the NF2 (neurofibromatosis type 2) tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22, which encodes the protein merlin.

NF2 is a genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing certain types of tumors, particularly meningiomas, which are benign tumors that arise from the meninges, the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. People with NF2 have a high risk of developing meningiomas, as well as other tumors such as schwannomas and ependymomas.

The other options are not directly related to the NF2 mutation:

A. Renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer, which is not typically associated with NF2.

"A 47-year-old executive schedules an appointment his physician for a routine medical check-up. He currently has no complaints and claims to be “as fit as a fiddle.” The physical examination findings are unremarkable, except for a mid-systolic murmur heard in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids on auscultation. The physician instructs the patient to stand from a supine position with the stethoscope still placed on his chest. Which of the following changes would occur with this maneuver?",D,"The correct answer is D. A reduction in diastolic filling time.

Here's why:

The murmur heard in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids is consistent with an aortic systolic ejection murmur, likely due to aortic stenosis.

When the patient stands up from a supine position, several physiological changes occur:

1. Blood pools in the legs due to gravity, reducing venous return to the heart.
2. This decrease in venous return leads to a decrease in diastolic filling time, as the heart has less time to fill with blood before the next beat.
3. As a result, the murmur may become softer or even disappear, as the reduced diastolic filling time reduces the flow across the aortic valve, making the murmur less prominent.

The other options are not directly related to the physiological changes that occur when the patient stands up:

A. Right atrial pressure may increase due to other factors, but it's not directly related to the patient standing up.

B. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is a measure of left atrial pressure and is not directly affected by the patient's position.

C. The slope of the pacemaker potential is related to the electrical activity of the heart and is not affected by the patient standing up.

"A microbiologist is studying the emergence of a virulent strain of the virus. After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection. Which of the following viruses is capable of undergoing the above-mentioned process?",C,"The correct answer is C. Rotavirus.

The process described in the question is called reassortment, which is a mechanism of genetic recombination that occurs in certain viruses, including rotaviruses. Rotaviruses are segmented RNA viruses, meaning their genome is composed of multiple segments of RNA. When a host cell is co-infected with two different rotaviruses, the genome segments from each virus can mix and match, resulting in the formation of new, unique virus particles with a novel combination of genome segments. This process can lead to the emergence of new strains of rotavirus.

Reassortment is a common mechanism of genetic variation in rotaviruses and is thought to play a key role in the evolution of new strains. It is not a characteristic of the other options:

* Epstein-Barr virus (A) is a DNA virus and does not undergo reassortment.
* Human immunodeficiency virus (B) is a retrovirus that undergoes recombination, but not reassortment.

"A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a β-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen. Which of the following mediators is described in this experimental study?",D,"Let's break down the clues in the question:

1. The boy's symptoms worsen in springtime, especially when flowers are blooming, suggesting an allergic reaction to pollen.
2. The experimental therapy targets a mediator that favors class switching of antibodies, which is a key process in allergic reactions.
3. The mediator is involved in the exaggerated response observed during asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen.

Considering these clues, the correct answer is:

D. IL-4

Here's why:

* IL-4 is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the development of allergic responses, including class switching of antibodies to produce IgE, which is responsible for triggering allergic reactions.
* IL-4 is also involved in the recruitment of eosinophils, which are key players in asthmatic inflammation.
* IL-4 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma, and therapies targeting IL-4 have been explored as potential treatments for the condition.

The other options are not directly related to the described mechanism:

* IL-2 is involved in T-cell activation and proliferation, but it's not specifically linked to class switching of antibodies or allergic responses.
* IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can suppress allergic responses, but it's not directly involved in class switching of antibodies.
* IL-13 is involved in allergic responses, but it's more related to the recruitment of eosinophils and mucus production, rather than class switching of antibodies.

Diagnostic evaluation fails to discover an exact etiology of the boy's symptoms and the episode is classified as a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). The risk profile for BRUE in infants remains largely unknown. The pediatrician who saw the boy in the emergency department is trying to identify risk factors for BRUE. She is aware of several confounders, including age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She recruits 75 infants under 1 year of age with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE of the same age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She then compares the two groups with regard to history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection. Which of the following methods was conducted to control confounding bias in the study?",D,"The correct answer is D. Matching.

In this study, the pediatrician recruited two groups of infants: 75 with BRUE and 75 without BRUE. To control for confounding bias, she matched the two groups on certain characteristics, such as age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. This means that she ensured that the two groups were similar in terms of these potential confounding variables, which can affect the outcome of the study.

Matching is a method used to control for confounding bias by creating groups that are similar in terms of potential confounding variables. This helps to reduce the impact of confounding variables on the study's results and increases the validity of the findings.

"A 29-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to central chest pain over the past 3 days which is constant and unrelated to exertion. The pain is sharp, severe, increases when lying down, and improves with leaning forward. The pain also radiates to his shoulders and neck. The patient has no past medical history. He has smoked 10 cigarettes per day for the past 7 years and occasionally drinks alcohol. He presents with vital signs: blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, regular radial pulse of 95/min, and temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F). On physical exam, a scratching sound of to-and-from character is audible over the left sternal border at end-expiration with the patient leaning forward. His chest X-ray is normal and ECG is shown in the picture. Which of the following is the optimal therapy for this patient?",B,"A classic case!

Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, I'm going to take a stab at this.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with pericarditis, an inflammation of the pericardium, which is the sac surrounding the heart. The characteristic features are:

1. Central chest pain, often sharp and severe
2. Pain that increases when lying down and improves with leaning forward (this is known as ""positional pain"")
3. Radiation of pain to the shoulders and neck
4. The presence of a pericardial friction rub, which is the scratching sound audible over the left sternal border at end-expiration with the patient leaning forward.

The ECG shows a classic pattern of pericarditis, with diffuse ST-segment elevation and PR-segment depression.

Now, let's look at the options:

A. Indomethacin +/- omeprazole: This is a good choice, as indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can help reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Omeprazole may be added to protect the stomach from NSAID-induced gastritis.

B. Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole: This is also a good option, as ibuprofen is another NSAID that can help with pain and inflammation. Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory medication that can be used in combination with NSAIDs to reduce inflammation. Omeprazole may be added for stomach protection.

C. Pericardiocentesis: This is not the optimal therapy in this case, as pericardiocentesis is a procedure to drain fluid from the pericardial space, which is not indicated in this patient.

D. Pericardiectomy: This is a surgical procedure to remove part or all of the pericardium, which is not necessary in this case.

So, the optimal therapy for this patient would be either A or B. Both options are reasonable, but I would choose...

B. Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole

This combination therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing inflammation and relieving symptoms in patients with pericarditis.",Success
"A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for evaluation of altered mental status. He was found on the floor in front of his apartment. He is somnolent but responsive when aroused. His pulse is 64/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, and blood pressure is 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, an alcoholic smell and slurred speech are noted. Neurological exam shows diminished deep tendon reflexes bilaterally and an ataxic gait. His pupils are normal. Blood alcohol concentration is 0.04%. An ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",D,"Based on the symptoms and physical examination, I would say that the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is not ethanol intoxication (Option B), despite the presence of an alcoholic smell and slurred speech. The blood alcohol concentration of 0.04% is relatively low, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with ethanol intoxication at this level.

The patient's somnolence, slurred speech, diminished deep tendon reflexes, and ataxic gait are more suggestive of a central nervous system depressant. Given the patient's age and the presence of an alcoholic smell, I would suspect that the patient may have ingested another substance, such as benzodiazepine (Option D), which could be contributing to his symptoms.

Hypoglycemia (Option A) is unlikely, as the patient's blood pressure and respiratory rate are normal, and there is no mention of any other symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia, such as tremors or tachycardia.

Cannabis intoxication (Option C) is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with cannabis intoxication, and there is no mention of any other symptoms suggestive of cannabis use, such as conjunctival injection or increased appetite.

Therefore, based on the information provided, I would choose Option D, Benzodiazepine intoxication, as the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.",Success
"A 77-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with the complaints of fever, malaise, and night sweats. She recently observed an enlargement of her axillary lymph nodes, which she examines on a weekly basis. She has a remote history of breast cancer in her 60s that was treated with radiation and chemotherapy. She also reports a history of extensive travel to Africa and a 30-pack-year history of smoking. On physical exam, several axillary lymph nodes are palpable with a large non-tender palpable mass in her right axilla measuring 10 x 8 cm. Fine-needle aspiration demonstrates what the pathologist describes as ""a centroblastic and immunoblastic cell presence, suspicious for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)–diffuse large B cell variant"". Which of the following risk factors is responsible for this patient’s condition?",C,"Based on the patient's history and symptoms, the correct answer is C. Previous radiation therapy.

The patient's history of radiation therapy for breast cancer is a significant risk factor for developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), particularly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Radiation therapy is a known risk factor for NHL, and the latency period between radiation exposure and lymphoma development can be several decades.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:

A. Travel to Africa is not a known risk factor for NHL.

B. Axillary lymph node involvement is a symptom of the patient's condition, not a risk factor.

D. Previous breast cancer is not a direct risk factor for NHL, although the radiation therapy used to treat the breast cancer is a risk factor.

It's worth noting that the patient's 30-pack-year history of smoking may also be a contributing factor to her overall health, but it is not a specific risk factor for NHL.",Success
"A 3-month-old infant is brought to her pediatrician because she coughs and seems to have difficulty breathing while feeding. In addition, she seems to have less energy compared to other babies and appears listless throughout the day. She was born by cesarean section to a G1P1 woman with no prior medical history and had a normal APGAR score at birth. Her parents say that she has never been observed to turn blue. Physical exam reveals a high-pitched holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following abnormalities?",A,"Based on the symptoms described, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border is consistent with a VSD.

The correct answer is A. 22q11 deletion. VSD is a common congenital heart defect that can occur in isolation or as part of a larger genetic syndrome, such as 22q11 deletion syndrome (also known as DiGeorge syndrome). This syndrome is associated with a deletion of a portion of chromosome 22 and can cause a range of congenital anomalies, including heart defects, facial abnormalities, and developmental delays.

The other options are not directly related to the symptoms described:

B. Deletion of genes on chromosome 7 is associated with Williams syndrome, which is characterized by a unique facial appearance, intellectual disability, and cardiovascular abnormalities, but it is not typically associated with VSD.

C. Lithium exposure in utero is associated with Ebstein's anomaly, a rare congenital heart defect that affects the tricuspid valve.

D. Maternal alcohol consumption is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, which can cause a range of congenital anomalies, including heart defects, but it is not specifically associated with VSD.

It's worth noting that the diagnosis of a VSD can be confirmed with an echocardiogram, and further evaluation may be necessary to determine the underlying genetic cause of the defect.",Success
"A 30-year-old African American woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a dry cough and chest discomfort for the past 3 days. During this period, the patient has had headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, fever, and chills. Ten days ago, she was hiking with her family in Mississippi. The patient has asthma that is treated with an albuterol inhaler. Her mother has a lung disease treated with methotrexate. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 10 years. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Physical examination shows slight wheezes throughout both lung fields. Laboratory studies and urinalysis are positive for polysaccharide antigen. Bronchoalveolar lavage using silver/PAS-staining shows macrophages filled with a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",C,"Based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and laboratory results, the most likely cause of her symptoms is:

D. Blastomyces dermatitidis infection

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as dry cough, chest discomfort, headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, fever, and chills, are consistent with a fungal infection.
* The patient's recent hiking trip in Mississippi increases the likelihood of exposure to Blastomyces dermatitidis, which is commonly found in the southeastern United States.
* The presence of polysaccharide antigen in laboratory studies and urinalysis suggests a fungal infection.
* The bronchoalveolar lavage results showing macrophages filled with a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae are consistent with Blastomyces dermatitidis infection.
* The patient's asthma and smoking history may have increased her susceptibility to respiratory infections, but they are not directly related to the cause of her current symptoms.
* Legionella pneumophila infection (Option A) is unlikely, as it typically presents with a more severe pneumonia and is not typically associated with dimorphic fungi.
* Pneumocystis pneumonia (Option B) is also unlikely, as it typically affects immunocompromised individuals and is not typically associated with dimorphic fungi.
* Histoplasma capsulatum infection (Option C) is possible, but the presence of septate hyphae in the bronchoalveolar lavage results makes Blastomyces dermatitidis infection more likely.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and laboratory results, the most likely cause of her symptoms is Blastomyces dermatitidis infection.",Success

Monocytes 5%
Platelet count 280,000/mm3
What is the most likely causal microorganism?",D,"Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely causal microorganism is:

A. Streptococcus pneumoniae

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as fever, purulent cough, and basal crackles on the right side of the chest, are consistent with pneumonia.
* The chest radiography shows a new consolidation on the right side, which further supports the diagnosis of pneumonia.
* The complete blood count (CBC) shows an elevated neutrophil count (72%) and a moderate number of bands (4%), which suggests an acute inflammatory response, often seen in bacterial infections.
* Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, especially in older adults.
* The patient's age, underlying medical condition (stroke), and hospitalization for a week increase the risk of developing pneumonia, making S. pneumoniae a more likely culprit.

While Haemophilus influenzae (option C) is also a possible cause of pneumonia, the patient's age and underlying condition make S. pneumoniae a more likely choice. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (option B) is less likely, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a chronic or granulomatous infection. Staphylococcus aureus (option D) can cause pneumonia, but it is less common in community-acquired cases, and the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not strongly suggest a staphylococcal infection.",Success

No wheezing is heard on repeat pulmonary examination. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"Based on the scenario, the most appropriate next step in management is:

A. Intubate with mechanical ventilation

Here's why:

* The child's condition has deteriorated, becoming limp and lethargic, which suggests respiratory failure.
* The pulse rate has increased to 150/min, indicating tachycardia.
* The respiratory rate has decreased to 22/min, which may indicate fatigue or respiratory muscle weakness.
* The fact that no wheezing is heard on repeat pulmonary examination suggests that the airway obstruction has been relieved, but the child's respiratory status has not improved.
* Magnesium sulfate was administered, which is often used to treat severe asthma exacerbations, but its effect may be wearing off or may not be sufficient to reverse the respiratory failure.

Intubation with mechanical ventilation is necessary to support the child's respiratory function and prevent further deterioration. The other options are not directly related to addressing the child's current respiratory crisis:

* Option B, needle thoracostomy, is typically used to treat a tension pneumothorax, which is not mentioned in the scenario.
* Option C, bronchoscopy, is an invasive procedure that may not be necessary or relevant in this acute situation.

"A 5-year-old female suffers from recurrent infections by Aspergillus species, Pseudomonas species, and Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's neutrophils are examined in the laboratory and they fail to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test. Which of the following is most likely dysfunctional in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Respiratory burst.

Here's why:

The patient's symptoms, recurrent infections with Aspergillus, Pseudomonas, and Staphylococcus aureus, suggest a defect in the neutrophil's ability to combat fungal and bacterial infections. The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test is used to assess the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by neutrophils, which is essential for their antimicrobial activity.

A negative NBT test indicates that the patient's neutrophils are unable to produce ROS, which is a hallmark of a dysfunctional respiratory burst. This is a critical mechanism by which neutrophils kill microorganisms.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and the NBT test results:

A. Immunoglobulin class switching is a process that occurs in B cells, not neutrophils, and is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

B. Superoxide dismutase is an enzyme that converts superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide, but it is not directly involved in the respiratory burst.

C. Myeloperoxidase is an enzyme that helps to generate ROS, but a deficiency in myeloperoxidase would not explain the patient's symptoms and the negative NBT test result.

Given the patient's presentation, a chest X-ray is likely to show:

D. Steeple sign

The steeple sign is a characteristic radiographic finding in croup, where the tracheal air column appears narrow and tapered, resembling a steeple. This is due to the inflammation and narrowing of the trachea.

The other options are not directly related to croup:

A. Increased interstitial markings are more indicative of pneumonia or other respiratory infections.

B. Lobar consolidation in the lingual is not a typical finding in croup.

C. The thumbprint sign is actually a radiographic finding in adults with acute epiglottitis, not croup.

"A 26-year-old woman presents to a gynecologist after a missed period. After performing a complete physical examination and a screening test for pregnancy, her gynecologist informs her that she is pregnant. She is very surprised as she has been taking oral contraceptives regularly. When the gynecologist asks her about the consumption of any other medications, she mentions that she was placed on treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) 2 months ago. Her current anti-TB regimen includes rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin leading to decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone.

Rifampin, an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis, is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. This enzyme is responsible for metabolizing many drugs, including oral contraceptives. When rifampin induces CYP3A4, it increases the metabolism of ethinylestradiol and progesterone, the active components of oral contraceptives. As a result, the serum levels of these hormones decrease, reducing the effectiveness of the oral contraceptive and increasing the risk of pregnancy.

The other options are not correct:

B. CYP2A6 is not involved in the metabolism of oral contraceptives.

C. Pyrazinamide does not interfere with the intestinal absorption of oral contraceptives.

D. Ethambutol does not affect the renal elimination of progesterone.

Which of the following lab findings would most likely be seen in this patient?",D,"Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the most likely lab finding would be:

D. Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal tenderness, suggest a gastrointestinal infection, possibly due to a bacterial or viral pathogen.
* The presence of bloody stools and guaiac-positive stool suggests a possible invasive bacterial infection, such as Shigella or E. coli.
* The development of lower extremity weakness and tingling, along with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes, suggests a possible neurological complication, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).
* GBS is a post-infectious autoimmune disorder that can occur after a gastrointestinal infection. It is characterized by an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, which can cause muscle weakness, numbness, and tingling.
* The lab finding that would most likely be seen in this patient is an increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein with a normal cell count, which is a hallmark of GBS. The CSF protein level is often elevated due to the inflammatory response, but the cell count remains normal.

The other options are less likely:

* A. Gram stain positive CSF would suggest a bacterial meningitis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings.
* B. Peripheral eosinophilia would suggest an allergic reaction or parasitic infection, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings.

The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the left foot shows an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?,C,"Based on the symptoms and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is Metatarsus Adductus, a common congenital deformity of the foot.

Given the patient's age (3 weeks) and the fact that the deformity corrects with tickling the lateral border of the foot, the most appropriate next step in management would be:

C. Reassurance

Metatarsus Adductus often resolves spontaneously, especially if it is flexible and corrects with gentle manipulation. In this case, the deformity corrects with tickling the lateral border of the foot, indicating that it is a flexible deformity. Therefore, reassurance and observation are the most appropriate course of action.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Foot abduction brace may be necessary for more severe or rigid deformities, but it is not the first line of management for a flexible deformity that corrects with gentle manipulation.

B. Arthrodesis of the forefoot is a surgical procedure that is not indicated for Metatarsus Adductus, especially in a 3-week-old infant.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?""",D,"A great medical mystery to solve!

Let's break down the clues:

1. **Right upper abdominal pain and nausea**: Suggests a possible issue related to the liver, gallbladder, or bile ducts.
2. **Distended abdomen and right upper quadrant tenderness**: Indicates a potential obstruction or inflammation in the right upper quadrant.
3. **Normal bowel sounds**: Rules out a bowel obstruction.
4. **Leukocyte count 14,000/mm3**: Mild leukocytosis, which could indicate an infection or inflammation.
5. **Liver function tests**: Mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase suggests a possible biliary obstruction or cholestasis.
6. **Cholescintigraphy results**: The scan shows the intrahepatic bile ducts, hepatic ducts, common bile duct, and proximal small bowel, but no evidence of a gallbladder or cystic duct visualization. This suggests that the gallbladder is not functioning or is obstructed.

Considering these clues, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is:

**D. Obstruction of the cystic duct**

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with a possible acute cholecystitis, which is an inflammation of the gallbladder. The obstruction of the cystic duct, which connects the gallbladder to the common bile duct, would prevent the gallbladder from emptying, leading to inflammation and pain.

The other options are less likely:

A. Autodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma (pancreatitis) is unlikely given the normal AST and ALT levels.

B. Fistula between the gallbladder and small intestine would likely cause more severe symptoms, such as peritonitis or sepsis, which are not mentioned.

C. Infection with a hepatotropic virus is possible, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are more consistent with a biliary obstruction or inflammation.
