Question,Ground Truth,Prediction,Status
Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that tailored interventions, specifically telephone counseling, can increase mammography use among HMO women. Research shows that, compared to usual care, tailored telephone counseling promoted a significantly higher proportion of women having mammograms on schedule (71% vs 61%) after the first year of intervention. Additionally, telephone counseling was more effective than tailored print materials at promoting being on schedule with screening among women who were off-schedule during the previous year.",Success
Double balloon enteroscopy: is it efficacious and safe in a community setting?,yes,"YES, double balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is efficacious and safe in a community setting.

The evidence confirms that DBE is a valuable diagnostic and therapeutic tool in a community setting, with a high success rate in identifying and treating small bowel pathology. In this study, DBE was successful in identifying pathology in 74.4% of cases where video-capsule endoscopy (VCE) had previously detected abnormalities, and additionally found new findings not noted on VCE in 3 cases. The procedure was also safe, with no major complications reported.

Notably, the study's results demonstrate that DBE can be effectively performed in a community setting, with a mean procedure time of approximately 107 minutes for antegrade DBE and 101 minutes for retrograde DBE. The ability to perform endoscopic therapy, such as electrocautery and biopsy, in 30.3% and 25.8% of patients, respectively, further supports the efficacy of DBE in this setting.

While the study's sample size is relatively small, the results suggest that DBE can be a valuable tool in a community setting, and further investigation is warranted to confirm these findings.",Success
Do mutations causing low HDL-C promote increased carotid intima-media thickness?,no,"No, the study suggests that mutations causing low HDL-C do not promote increased carotid intima-media thickness. 

The evidence confirms that despite significantly lower HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels in cases with genetic mutations, the cIMT measurements were nearly identical between cases and controls (0.66±0.17 cm vs. 0.65±0.18 cm, respectively). This finding suggests that low HDL-C resulting from genetic variation may not be associated with increased early atherosclerosis, as measured by cIMT.",Success
A short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital: are they effective?,yes,"YES, the evidence confirms that short stay or 23-hour wards in general and academic children's hospitals are effective. 

Research shows that the short stay ward increased hospital efficiency, with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital). The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, ranging from 4% to 6%, and the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge was less than 1%. Notably, there were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, and parental satisfaction was high. Furthermore, the development of the short stay ward resulted in estimated savings of $1/2 million to $2.3 million to the hospital due to more efficient bed usage.",Success
Did Chile's traffic law reform push police enforcement?,yes,"Yes, the evidence confirms that Chile's traffic law reform led to an increase in police traffic enforcement. 

Research shows that the interaction effect of the number of traffic tickets per police officer with the traffic law reform is significantly associated with a decrease in traffic fatalities and severe injuries. This suggests that the reform had a direct impact on police enforcement, leading to an increase in the number of traffic tickets issued per police officer. The piecewise regression model results further support this conclusion, indicating that police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37% during the 2007-2012 period.",Success
Therapeutic anticoagulation in the trauma patient: is it safe?,no,"No, therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients is not entirely safe. The evidence confirms that 21% of patients in this study experienced at least one anticoagulation complication, with 11 patients requiring blood transfusions due to a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration. Furthermore, 4% of patients died, with 3 of these deaths attributed to significant hemorrhage caused by anticoagulation. Research shows that certain patient factors, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, use of unfractionated heparin, and lower initial platelet count, are associated with an increased risk of complications.",Success
Prompting Primary Care Providers about Increased Patient Risk As a Result of Family History: Does It Work?,no,"No, prompting primary care providers about increased patient risk as a result of family history does not significantly change their behavior or lead to improved patient outcomes.

The evidence confirms that despite the implementation of automated, tailored prompts highlighting familial risk for various diseases, there was no significant change in primary care physicians' behavior, including documentation of risk status or screening interventions for the targeted diseases. Specifically, the study found that only 53.5% of physician responses reviewed family history, and only 0.7% reviewed family history and ordered tests or referrals. Moreover, there was no significant change in problem summary list documentation of risk status or screening interventions for any of the 6 diseases studied. These findings suggest that simply prompting primary care providers about increased patient risk due to family history is not enough to drive meaningful changes in their practice.",Success
Do emergency ultrasound fellowship programs impact emergency medicine residents' ultrasound education?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that emergency ultrasound (EUS) fellowship programs have a positive impact on emergency medicine (EM) residents' ultrasound education. 

Research shows that residents in programs with EUS fellowships performed more scans (P = .04) and reported a broader scope of bedside US applications (P < .05) compared to those in programs without fellowships. Additionally, significant differences were noted in the barriers to US education between residency programs with and without fellowships (P < .05). These findings suggest that EUS fellowships enhance EM residents' US educational experiences.",Success
Is there still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children?,yes,"Yes, there is still a need for living-related liver transplantation (LRT) in children.

The evidence confirms that LRT has a superior outcome in terms of postoperative graft function and survival compared to split-liver transplantation (SLT). Although the combination of SLT and LRT has abolished deaths on the waiting list, the study's findings suggest that LRT has a higher actual patient survival rate (88% vs 82%) and graft survival rate (81% vs 76%) compared to SLT. Additionally, the incidence of primary nonfunction was significantly lower in the LRT group (2.3% vs 12%). While SLT has its advantages, the optimized outcome of LRT makes it a valuable option for children in need of liver transplantation.",Success
Do patterns of knowledge and attitudes exist among unvaccinated seniors?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that distinct patterns of knowledge and attitudes exist among unvaccinated seniors, with four identified clusters: Potentials, Fearful Uninformeds, Doubters, and Misinformeds. Research shows that these clusters are characterized by varying levels of understanding and misconceptions about influenza vaccination, with significant differences in their vaccination histories. Specifically, 45% of unvaccinated seniors were classified as Potentials, who would receive the vaccine to prevent disease, while 9% were Fearful Uninformeds, who were unsure if the vaccine causes illness. Additionally, 27% were Doubters, who questioned the vaccine's efficacy, and 19% were Misinformeds, who believed the vaccine causes illness. These findings highlight the importance of addressing knowledge gaps and misconceptions to improve influenza vaccination rates among seniors.",Success
Cardiovascular risk in a rural adult West African population: is resting heart rate also relevant?,yes,"Yes, resting heart rate (RHR) is a relevant marker for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in a rural adult West African population.

The evidence confirms that in this study, 19% of the participants had an elevated RHR (>90 bpm), which was significantly associated with age, waist circumference, and blood pressure. Furthermore, individuals with an elevated RHR had a higher risk of casual high blood pressure (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.15-3.26%, p = 0.013) independently of other established CVD risk factors. This suggests that RHR is an important indicator of CVD risk in this population, and its measurement can provide valuable information for identifying individuals at risk.",Success
Secondhand smoke risk in infants discharged from an NICU: potential for significant health disparities?,yes,"Yes, the evidence confirms that secondhand smoke risk in infants discharged from an NICU is associated with significant health disparities.

Research shows that socioeconomic status, race, and mental health status are related to secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) and household smoking bans. Specifically, the study found that:

* Almost half of the families with a smoker reported an annual income of less than $25,000, and only 27.8% of these families had a total smoking ban in place, compared to almost 60% of families earning more (p<.01).
* African American and Caucasian families were less likely to have a smoking ban compared with Hispanics (p<.05).
* Mothers who reported no smoking ban were more depressed than those who had a household smoking ban (p<.02).

These findings suggest that infants from low-income families, African American and Caucasian families, and those with depressed mothers may be at a higher risk of SHSe due to lack of household smoking bans. This highlights the potential for significant health disparities in these populations.",Success
Are reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain related to somatisation?,yes,"Yes, the evidence suggests that reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain are related to somatisation.

The study found that only two mechanical factors, teeth grinding and facial trauma, were independently associated with chronic oro-facial pain after adjusting for psychological factors. However, these same mechanical factors were also commonly associated with the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes, which is a hallmark of somatisation. Specifically, the odds ratios for teeth grinding and facial trauma were 1.8 and 2.1, respectively, indicating a significant association with other unexplained syndromes. This suggests that the relationship between mechanical dysfunction and chronic oro-facial pain may be influenced by somatisation tendencies.

Research shows that somatisation is a common phenomenon in chronic pain conditions, and this study's findings support the idea that mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain may be, at least in part, related to somatisation.",Success
Is the Hawkins sign able to predict necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus?,maybe,"YES, the Hawkins sign is able to predict necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus.

The evidence confirms that the presence of the Hawkins sign is a significant predictor of not developing avascular necrosis, with a P-value of 0.03. In this study, 12 cases with a positive Hawkins sign did not develop necrosis, while 4 cases with a negative Hawkins sign did develop necrosis. This suggests that the Hawkins sign is a reliable indicator of a lower risk of avascular necrosis in talar neck fractures.",Success
Is a mandatory general surgery rotation necessary in the surgical clerkship?,no,"NO, a mandatory general surgery rotation is not necessary in the surgical clerkship.

The evidence confirms that students who did not participate in a general surgery rotation demonstrated equal mastery of surgical clerkship objectives compared to those who did. The study's findings, based on 54 students, showed no significant differences in scores between the two groups across multiple assessment parameters, including written examinations, OSCE, ward evaluations, self-assessment objectives questionnaire, and satisfaction surveys. This suggests that the absence of a general surgery rotation did not negatively impact students' ability to achieve the clerkship's objectives.",Success
Is Acupuncture Efficacious for Treating Phonotraumatic Vocal Pathologies?,yes,"YES, acupuncture is efficacious for treating phonotraumatic vocal pathologies.

The evidence confirms that genuine acupuncture significantly improved vocal function, as measured by maximum fundamental frequency, and perceived quality of life in individuals with phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions. Moreover, structural improvements, specifically a reduction in the size of vocal fold lesions, were only observed in the genuine acupuncture group. These findings suggest that acupuncture can be an effective treatment for phonotraumatic vocal pathologies.

Notably, the study's results show that both genuine and sham acupuncture groups demonstrated significant improvements in vocal function and quality of life, indicating a potential placebo effect. However, the genuine acupuncture group's structural improvements, as observed through endoscopy, were unique to this group, highlighting the specific therapeutic benefits of acupuncture.

Research shows that the genuine acupuncture group's significant reduction in vocal fold lesion size (p < 0.05) is a crucial finding, as it directly addresses the primary outcome of interest in this study. This outcome is particularly relevant, as it suggests that acupuncture can lead to tangible, anatomical improvements in vocal fold lesions.

While the study's results are promising, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of the study, including the relatively small sample size and the potential for bias. Nevertheless, the findings provide strong evidence for the efficacy of acupuncture in treating phonotraumatic vocal pathologies.",Success
Is aneurysm repair justified for the patients aged 80 or older after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage?,yes,"Yes, aneurysm repair is justified for patients aged 80 or older after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

The evidence confirms that patients aged 80 or older who received aneurysm repair (clipping or coil embolization) had significantly better clinical outcomes compared to those who received conservative treatment. Specifically, the study found that 81.2% of the patients in the repair group had an aneurysm in the anterior circulation, and despite no differences in WFNS grade on admission and premorbid modified Rankin Scale, the repair group showed better clinical outcomes. This suggests that aneurysm repair can be a viable and beneficial option for elderly patients with aSAH, even at an advanced age.",Success
Do general practice characteristics influence uptake of an information technology (IT) innovation in primary care?,no,"No, general practice characteristics do not significantly influence the uptake of an IT innovation in primary care, except for the number of diabetes-educated staff.

The evidence confirms that, in this study, none of the general practice variables, including total list size, training status, numbers of GPs, mean age of GPs, numbers of female GPs, and level of deprivation of the population, were associated with online use of the web-based clinical information system. However, the number of diabetes-educated staff was consistently associated with increased use by nurses and GPs. This suggests that targeted training and education may play a key role in promoting the adoption and use of IT innovations in primary care.",Success
Do follow-up recommendations for abnormal Papanicolaou smears influence patient adherence?,no,"NO, the type of follow-up recommendation (colposcopy or repeated Pap smear) does not significantly influence patient adherence.

The evidence confirms that the rate of adherence to follow-up recommendations was similar for both colposcopy and repeated Pap smear, with an odds ratio of 1.40 (95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46), indicating no significant difference. However, the study found that the use of multiple patient reminders (up to 3) substantially improved adherence to follow-up, and that women without insurance and those attending a specific clinic were less likely to adhere to follow-up recommendations.",Success
Does diabetes mellitus influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer?,no,"No, diabetes mellitus does not significantly influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer.

The evidence confirms that the diagnostic power of PET in patients with hyperglycaemic DM, euglycaemic DM, and non-DM did not differ significantly in identifying metastatic lesions (AUC, 0.967/0.947/0.925, P>0.05) or primary tumors/local recurrence (AUC, 0.950/0.938/0.979, P>0.05). This suggests that diabetes mellitus does not have a significant impact on the efficacy of FDG-PET in diagnosing cervical cancer.",Success
Biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery: is there a difference between advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis?,yes,"YES, there is a difference between advanced surface ablation (ASA) and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis (SBK) in terms of biomechanical and wound healing characteristics after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery.

The evidence confirms that ASA and SBK have distinct differences in their wound healing profiles. ASA is associated with hypercellular fibrotic stromal scarring, which can lead to corneal haze or breakthrough haze. In contrast, SBK is characterized by hypocellular primitive stromal scarring, which poses a risk for interface wound complications in both the short and long term. These differences are supported by histologic, ultrastructural, and cohesive tensile strength evaluations, which demonstrate distinct patterns of collagen fibril orientation and lamellar interweaving in the corneal stroma and Bowman's layer.

Research shows that ASA tends to be biomechanically safer than SBK, with a lower risk of keratectasia due to its anterior and peripheral location. However, both techniques still have limitations due to inadequate reparative wound healing in adult human corneal stromal wounds.",Success
Does radiotherapy of the primary rectal cancer affect prognosis after pelvic exenteration for recurrent rectal cancer?,yes,"Yes, radiotherapy of the primary rectal cancer negatively affects prognosis after pelvic exenteration for recurrent rectal cancer.

The evidence confirms that patients who received radiotherapy for their primary rectal cancer had poorer outcomes after pelvic exenteration, including lower rates of clear resection margins, increased surgical complications, and lower disease-free survival. Specifically, the study found that 63% of irradiated patients had clear resection margins, compared to 87% of non-irradiated patients (p = 0.010). Additionally, irradiated patients had a lower disease-free survival rate (p = 0.022).

While the study is limited by its retrospective nature and heterogeneous radiotherapy regimes, the findings suggest that radiotherapy for primary rectal cancer may compromise outcomes after pelvic exenteration for recurrent disease.",Success
Is motion perception deficit in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality?,yes,"NO, the evidence suggests that motion perception deficit in schizophrenia is not solely a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality.

Research shows that in the 150 msec experiment, where eye movement was minimized, schizophrenia patients and control subjects had similar speed discrimination thresholds. This indicates that motion perception deficits are not entirely due to eye-tracking abnormalities. However, when the stimulus duration was increased to 300 msec, allowing for more eye movement, patients had significantly higher speed discrimination thresholds than control subjects. This suggests that eye-tracking difficulties may still contribute to motion perception deficits in schizophrenia, but it is not the primary cause. The correlation between eye tracking and speed discrimination in control subjects, but not in patients, further supports this conclusion.",Success
Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy: is it possible?,yes,"YES, transgastric endoscopic splenectomy is possible. The evidence confirms that in a porcine model, per-oral transgastric splenectomy can be technically feasible using a flexible endoscope. In the study, six pigs underwent endoscopic splenectomy without complications during gastric incision and entrance into the peritoneal cavity, and visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs was very good. Ligation of the splenic vessels and mobilization of the spleen were achieved using commercially available devices and endoscopic accessories.",Success
It's Fournier's gangrene still dangerous?,yes,"YES, Fournier's gangrene is still a dangerous condition. The evidence confirms that despite advances in treatment, the mortality rate remains high. In this study, the mortality rate was 35.7% (5 out of 14 patients), which is consistent with other reports. The significant difference in leukocyte count between survivors and non-survivors suggests that leukocytosis may be a prognostic indicator of mortality. Additionally, the mean hospital stay of 19 days indicates that Fournier's gangrene can lead to prolonged and complex hospitalizations. While antibiotics and aggressive debridement are essential in managing the condition, the high mortality rate emphasizes the need for prompt recognition and aggressive treatment to improve outcomes.",Success
Do provider service networks result in lower expenditures compared with HMOs or primary care case management in Florida's Medicaid program?,yes,"YES, provider service networks (PSNs) result in lower expenditures compared to HMOs in Florida's Medicaid program.

The evidence confirms that among SSI (Supplemental Security Income) enrollees, PSNs lowered PMPM expenditures by $7 more than HMOs, indicating a significant cost-saving advantage for PSNs. This finding is based on a comprehensive analysis of 26,819,987 person-months of claims data from Florida Medicaid, using a difference-in-difference approach to compare changes in enrollee expenditures before and after implementation of the Demonstration.

It is essential to note that this study specifically focused on the Florida Medicaid Demonstration and may not be generalizable to other Medicaid programs or populations. However, within the context of this study, the data clearly suggests that PSNs are associated with lower expenditures compared to HMOs.",Success
Assessment of carotid artery stenosis before coronary artery bypass surgery. Is it always necessary?,no,"No, it is not always necessary to assess carotid artery stenosis before coronary artery bypass surgery.

The evidence confirms that selective carotid screening, based on risk factors such as peripheral vascular disease, carotid bruit, diabetes mellitus, age >70 years, and/or history of cerebrovascular disease, is effective in detecting significant carotid disease. In this study, the prevalence of carotid stenosis was significantly higher in the high-risk group (9.1%) compared to the low-risk group (1.2%). Furthermore, all concomitant or staged carotid endarterectomies/CAB and all patients who had perioperative strokes were in the high-risk group.

Research shows that selective screening can help identify patients who are at higher risk of carotid stenosis and perioperative stroke, allowing for targeted interventions and improved outcomes. Therefore, universal screening may not be necessary, and a selective approach based on risk factors can be a more effective and efficient strategy.",Success
Should direct mesocolon invasion be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer?,maybe,"Yes, direct mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer.

The evidence confirms that patients with direct mesocolon invasion from gastric cancer have significantly worse curability, a higher number and extent of nodal metastasis, and poorer survival outcomes compared to patients with T3 stage disease. However, the survival rate of patients with mesocolon invasion who underwent curative resection was significantly better than those with incurable factors. This suggests that mesocolon invasion is a significant prognostic factor that should be considered in the staging of gastric cancer, and including it in the T4 category would provide a more accurate reflection of the disease severity.

Research shows that the 5-year survival rate of patients with mesocolon invasion was significantly lower than that of patients with T3 stage disease (22.2% vs 44.1%, p < 0.001). This highlights the importance of recognizing mesocolon invasion as a distinct entity in the staging of gastric cancer.

While the UICC does not currently recognize mesocolon invasion as an adjacent structure involved in gastric cancer, the findings of this study strongly suggest that it should be included in the T4 category to provide a more accurate staging system.",Success
Does pretreatment with statins improve clinical outcome after stroke?,no,"Maybe. The evidence suggests that pretreatment with statins may have a moderately strong, but statistically nonsignificant, association with improved clinical outcome after stroke, as measured by early discharge to home. Specifically, the multiple-adjusted odds ratio was 1.42 (95% CI 0.90 to 2.22), indicating a potential trend towards improved outcome, but the confidence interval includes 1, indicating no statistically significant difference. It is essential to note that this study had limitations, such as its observational design and the fact that prognostic factors were more unfavorable among patients on statins, which may have influenced the results. Further investigation is needed to confirm or refute these findings.",Success
Human papillomavirus and pterygium. Is the virus a risk factor?,maybe,"No, the evidence suggests that human papillomavirus (HPV) is not a significant risk factor for the development of pterygia.

Research shows that out of 90 pterygium specimens analyzed, only 4 (4.4%) were found to harbor HPV, and all of these were identified as HPV type 6. In contrast, none of the 20 normal conjunctival biopsy specimens were HPV-positive. Furthermore, the HPV-positive pterygia did not show any evidence of HPV DNA by in situ hybridization (ISH), suggesting that the virus may not be actively involved in the development of pterygia. These findings indicate that HPV is not a common or significant risk factor for pterygium development.",Success
Can PRISM predict length of PICU stay?,no,"YES, PRISM can predict length of PICU stay, but with a moderate correlation.

The evidence confirms that PRISM scores are correlated with length of PICU stay, as demonstrated by the Spearman and Pearson coefficients of correlation (0.2 and 0.08, respectively). Although the correlation is not strong, it is statistically significant (p<0.001 and p=0.0003, respectively). Notably, the correlation improves when LOS is logarithmically transformed, suggesting a non-linear relationship between PRISM scores and LOS.

Furthermore, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on PRISM item patterns, age, and sex was able to estimate LOS with a moderate correlation (Pearson's coefficient of correlation: 0.21, p<0.001) in the independent validation sample. This suggests that PRISM scores can be used to develop predictive models for LOS, although the accuracy may not be high.

It is essential to acknowledge that the correlation between PRISM and LOS is not strong, and other factors may influence LOS. However, the study's findings support the use of PRISM as a predictor of LOS, and the development of more advanced models, such as ANN, may improve the accuracy of these predictions.",Success
Can predilatation in transcatheter aortic valve implantation be omitted?,yes,"YES, predilatation in transcatheter aortic valve implantation can be omitted. 

The evidence confirms that omitting balloon predilatation in TAVI does not affect early hemodynamic results or complication rates. In a randomized study of 60 consecutive TAVI patients, no significant differences were found between the standard procedure and the protocol without balloon predilatation. This suggests that predilatation may not be a necessary step in the TAVI procedure.",Success
Autoerotic asphyxiation: secret pleasure--lethal outcome?,yes,"Yes, autoerotic asphyxiation (AEA) can have a lethal outcome.

The evidence confirms that AEA, a practice of inducing hypoxia or anoxia to enhance sexual excitement, can lead to unintended death, particularly among children, preteens, and adolescents. Research shows that AEA is often a clandestine and elusive practice, making it challenging to identify and address. The study highlights that pediatricians can play a crucial role in recognizing the syndrome, discussing concerns with patients, and potentially preventing tragic outcomes.

According to the study, AEA is typically characterized by a ritualized and symbolic biopsychosocial drama, often involving a sadomasochistic relationship with a female figure. Inexperienced practitioners may miscalculate the risks, leading to fatal consequences. It is essential for pediatricians to be aware of AEA's manifestations, prevalence, and age range to provide timely intervention and guidance.",Success
Does a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis affect its management?,no,"No, a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis does not affect its management.

The evidence confirms that in this study, colonoscopy did not lead to any new or different diagnoses, and no colonic malignancy was detected. Additionally, the survival rates between patients who underwent colonoscopy and those who did not were similar, with no significant differences (P=0.62). The presence of polyps in 32% of patients did not alter the management of acute diverticulitis. Research shows that the primary goal of colonoscopy in this context is to rule out malignancy, which was not found in this study. Therefore, the results suggest that colonoscopy does not have a significant impact on the management of acute diverticulitis.",Success
"Body perception: do parents, their children, and their children's physicians perceive body image differently?",yes,"Yes, parents, their children, and their children's physicians perceive body image differently.

The evidence confirms that there are significant discrepancies in body size perception among parents, children, and physicians. The study found that 44% of parents and 40% of children underestimated their child's body size, respectively, using word descriptions. Similarly, 47% of parents and 43% of children underestimated body size using figures. In contrast, physicians had a higher percentage of correct estimates, but still underestimated 33% of patients using both word descriptions and figures.

Research shows that these discrepancies can lead to misperceptions of body size, with some obese children not being recognized and average-weight children being perceived as underweight. These findings highlight the importance of accurate body size perception in pediatric care, particularly in the context of weight-related health concerns.",Success
Is there any relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis?,yes,"YES, there is a potential relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis.

The evidence confirms that patients with relapsing-remitting MS have significantly higher levels of antideoxyribonuclease B (ADNase B) compared to healthy controls, suggesting a possible link between streptococcal infection and MS. Specifically, the study found that ADNase B levels were significantly higher in MS patients (p<0.001), indicating a potential immune response to streptococcal infection in these individuals.

While the study did not find a significant difference in antistreptolysin O (ASO) levels between MS patients and controls, the elevated ADNase B levels suggest that streptococcal infection may play a role in the development or progression of MS. Further research is needed to fully understand the nature of this relationship and its implications for MS diagnosis and treatment.",Success
Is tumour expression of VEGF associated with venous invasion and survival in pT3 renal cell carcinoma?,maybe,"YES, tumour expression of VEGF is associated with venous invasion and survival in pT3 renal cell carcinoma.

The evidence confirms that VEGF expression is an independent predictive factor of survival in pT3 renal cell carcinoma, with an odds ratio of 6.07. Additionally, univariate analysis revealed that VEGF expression is significantly associated with survival (p<0.01). Although the study did not find a direct correlation between VEGF expression and venous invasion, the association with survival suggests that VEGF plays a role in the progression of the disease, including venous invasion.",Success
Injury and poisoning mortality among young men--are there any common factors amenable to prevention?,yes,"Yes, there are common factors amenable to prevention.

The evidence confirms that a significant proportion of deaths from injury and poisoning among young men aged 15-39 years are associated with preventable factors. Specifically, the study found that:

* 29.1% of deaths were due to poisoning by alcohol and drugs, which suggests that substance abuse is a critical factor contributing to these deaths.
* 39.4% of cases were unemployed, indicating that socioeconomic factors may play a role in increasing the risk of injury and poisoning.
* 74.2% of cases were single, which may suggest that social isolation or lack of social support could be a contributing factor.
* 77% of deaths exhibited self-destructive behavior, implying that mental health issues, such as depression or anxiety, may be underlying causes.

These findings highlight the importance of addressing substance abuse, socioeconomic disparities, social isolation, and mental health issues as potential targets for prevention strategies. By focusing on these factors, it may be possible to reduce the incidence of injury and poisoning deaths among young men.",Success
Does either obesity or OSA severity influence the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects?,yes,"Yes, OSA severity influences the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects, but obesity does not.

The evidence confirms that there is a moderate correlation between autoCPAP pressure and OSA severity, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.34 (p = 0.02) for apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) and 0.48 (p < 0.001) for oxygen desaturation index (ODI). This suggests that as OSA severity increases, the autoCPAP pressure required to treat it also increases.

On the other hand, the study found no significant correlation between autoCPAP pressure and measures of obesity, including neck circumference, waist circumference, and body mass index (BMI). This indicates that obesity itself does not have a significant impact on the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects.

It's essential to note that while obesity may not directly influence the response of autotitrating CPAP machines, it is often associated with OSA, and therefore, may have an indirect impact through its relationship with OSA severity.",Success
Aripiprazole: a new risk factor for pathological gambling?,yes,"Yes, aripiprazole may be a new risk factor for pathological gambling.

The evidence confirms that in 7 out of 8 patients treated with aripiprazole, the probability of pathological gambling being caused by the medication is considered ""possible"" according to a standardized algorithm. This suggests a potential association between aripiprazole use and the development of pathological gambling. While the study is limited by its small sample size and specific patient population (schizophrenic or bipolar individuals with a history of addictive disorders), the findings warrant further investigation into this potential adverse drug reaction.",Success
Immune suppression by lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine on T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens: does synergy exist?,yes,"YES, synergy exists between lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine in suppressing T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens.

The evidence confirms that combining lysosomotropic amines, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, with cyclosporine results in synergistic suppression of T-cell responses to minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHCs) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. Specifically, the study found that similar concentrations of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine suppress T-cell responses to MiHCs, and when combined with cyclosporine, they exhibit synergistic suppression of proliferative responses to MiHCs and MHC antigens. This synergy is observed in both MiHC-specific and alloreactive T-cell responses.",Success
Does induction chemotherapy have a role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma?,yes,"YES, induction chemotherapy has a role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

The evidence confirms that induction chemotherapy improves overall survival, freedom from relapse, and local control in patients with Stage IV nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Specifically, the 5-year actuarial rates for patients who received induction chemotherapy were significantly higher compared to those who did not: overall survival (68% vs. 56%, p = 0.02), freedom from relapse (64% vs. 37%, p = 0.01), and local control (86% vs. 56%, p = 0.009). Additionally, the actuarial 5-year distant failure rate in patients with undifferentiated NPC or poorly differentiated carcinoma who received induction chemotherapy and controlled in the primary and neck was 13%. These findings suggest that induction chemotherapy is a valuable component of the treatment strategy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, particularly in advanced stages.",Success
"Are normally sighted, visually impaired, and blind pedestrians accurate and reliable at making street crossing decisions?",maybe,"Yes. The evidence confirms that normally sighted and visually impaired pedestrians are accurate and reliable in their street crossing decision-making ability when using either visual plus auditory information or visual information only. However, under the auditory information only condition, all subjects, including the blind, were reliable but inaccurate in their street crossing decisions. Specifically, the study found that blind subjects were the least accurate with their street crossing decisions under the hearing only condition, with a statistically significant difference compared to normally sighted (P = 0.018) and visually impaired subjects (P = 0.019).",Success
Is Chaalia/Pan Masala harmful for health?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that Chaalia and Pan Masala are harmful for health. According to the study, 96% of the children believed Chaalia to be harmful for health, and 60% believed the same for Pan Masala. This suggests a strong awareness among the students about the negative health effects of these substances. Research shows that the harmful effects of Chaalia and Pan Masala are well-established, and it is likely that the students' knowledge is based on credible sources.",Success
Is HIV/STD control in Jamaica making a difference?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that the comprehensive HIV/STD Control Program in Jamaica has made a significant impact on the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

Research shows that despite a marginal increase in AIDS incidence rates, HIV prevalence in the general population remains low (around 1% or less). Moreover, the program has led to a decline in syphilis rates and congenital syphilis cases. Notably, there has been a significant increase in condom use among various groups, including women, men, gay men, inner-city adults, and adolescents. Specifically, condom use with non-regular partners has increased among women from 37% in 1992 to 73% in 1996 (P=0.006), and among men, around 81% have ever used condoms and 77% used them with non-regular partners.

Furthermore, the program has contributed to a decline in high-risk behaviors, such as sex with non-regular partners, which decreased from 35% in 1994 to 26% in 1996 (P<0.001) among men aged 15-49 years.

While HIV prevalence rates remain high among certain high-risk groups, such as female prostitutes and homosexuals, the overall trend suggests that the comprehensive HIV/STD Control Program has been effective in controlling the spread of HIV/AIDS in Jamaica.",Success
Is Panton-Valentine leucocidin associated with the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the UK?,maybe,"No, the evidence suggests that Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) is not associated with the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the UK.

Research shows that out of 244 consecutive bacteraemia isolates of S. aureus, only 1.6% (4 isolates) were PVL-positive, and all of these were methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). Furthermore, none of the 88 oxacillin-resistant (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) isolates were PVL-positive. This suggests that PVL is not a key marker of disease severity in S. aureus bacteraemia in the UK.",Success
Are even impaired fasting blood glucose levels preoperatively associated with increased mortality after CABG surgery?,yes,"YES, even impaired fasting blood glucose levels preoperatively are associated with increased mortality after CABG surgery.

The evidence confirms that patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) levels, which are below the diagnostic threshold for diabetes mellitus, have a higher risk of mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Specifically, the study found that patients with IFG levels (5.6 mmol/L ≤ fB-glu < 6.1 mmol/L) had a relative risk of 1.7 for 30-day mortality and 2.9 for 1-year mortality compared to patients with normal fasting blood glucose levels (<5.6 mmol/L). These findings suggest that even mildly elevated fasting blood glucose levels preoperatively are associated with increased mortality after CABG surgery.",Success
Does positron emission tomography change management in primary rectal cancer?,yes,"Yes, positron emission tomography (PET) changes management in primary rectal cancer. 

Research shows that in 17% of cases (8 out of 46 patients), management was altered due to PET scan findings, including cancellation of surgery in 13% of cases and changes to the radiotherapy field in 4% of cases. Additionally, overall tumor stage was changed following PET in 39% of patients (18 out of 46). Although the surgical management of 78% of patients remained unchanged, PET-induced changes were deemed appropriate in each case based on subsequent clinical follow-up.",Success
Can you deliver accurate tidal volume by manual resuscitator?,no,"No, the study suggests that it is challenging to deliver accurate tidal volume by manual resuscitator. The evidence confirms that the volume delivered to the patient varies significantly depending on the method used, with the two-handed method delivering a significantly greater tidal volume than the one-handed method. The study found that physical characteristics, such as hand size, volume, and grip power, do not correlate with the volume delivered, and education and practice levels have only a weak correlation with tidal volume. The mean tidal volumes delivered in the study ranged from 458.31 ml to 644.24 ml, indicating a significant variation in volume delivery.",Success
Does hypoglycaemia increase the risk of cardiovascular events?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that severe hypoglycaemia is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. Research shows that severe hypoglycaemia is linked to a 58% increased risk of the primary composite outcome (HR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.24-2.02, P<0.001). Additionally, severe hypoglycaemia is associated with a 74% increased risk of mortality (HR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.39-2.19, P<0.001) and a 71% increased risk of cardiovascular death (HR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.27-2.30, P<0.001).",Success
Is dexamethasone an effective alternative to oral prednisone in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations?,yes,"Yes, dexamethasone is an effective alternative to oral prednisone in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations. 

The evidence confirms that six clinical trials comparing dexamethasone to prednisone found no superiority of prednisone in treating mild to moderate asthma exacerbations. A meta-analysis of these trials demonstrated homogeneity between the two groups in terms of symptomatic return to baseline and unplanned physician revisits after the initial emergency department encounter. Additionally, some studies suggested potential benefits of dexamethasone, including improved compliance and reduced vomiting.",Success
Mammographic screening in Sami speaking municipalities and a control group. Are early outcome measures influenced by ethnicity?,yes,"Yes, early outcome measures are influenced by ethnicity.

The evidence confirms that the attendance rate and recall rates in the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) differ significantly between Sami-speaking municipalities and the control group. Specifically, the attendance rate was higher in the Sami population (78% vs 75%, p<0.01), and the recall rates were lower in the Sami population (2.4% vs 3.3%, p<0.01). Although the rate of invasive screen-detected cancer was not significantly different between the two groups, the percentage of all breast cancers detected in the NBCSP was lower among the Sami population (67% vs 86%, p=0.06). These findings suggest that ethnicity plays a role in shaping early outcome measures in mammographic screening.",Success
Cycloplegic autorefraction in young adults: is it mandatory?,maybe,"No, cycloplegic autorefraction is not mandatory in young adults.

The evidence confirms that the mean difference in spherical equivalent refractive error between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic measurements is 0.68 ± 0.83 D, which is a relatively small difference. While there are significant differences in refractive error between hypermetropes and myopes, as well as among different levels of hypermetropia, the overall difference is not substantial enough to warrant mandatory cycloplegic autorefraction in young adults. Research shows that non-cycloplegic refraction can provide a reasonably accurate measurement of refractive error in young adults, making cycloplegic autorefraction unnecessary in most cases.",Success
Does screening or surveillance for primary hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasonography improve the prognosis of patients?,yes,"Yes, the evidence confirms that screening or surveillance for primary hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasonography improves the prognosis of patients.

Research shows that the adjusted odds ratios for the screened group versus the unscreened group were 0.33, 0.33, and 0.37 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival time, respectively, indicating a significant improvement in survival outcomes for the screened group. Similarly, the adjusted odds ratios for surveillance versus nonsurveillance were 0.58, 0.45, and 0.44, respectively, also indicating a significant improvement in survival outcomes for the surveillance group. These results were statistically significant, and a significant gradient relationship was found between prognostic outcomes and the extent of screening history.

These findings suggest that ultrasonographic screening and surveillance for primary hepatocellular carcinoma can lead to improved survival outcomes and better tumor morphology and T staging.",Success
"""Would a man smell a rose then throw it away?",maybe,"No, the study suggests that Jordanian men do not reject their wives afflicted with breast cancer. 

The evidence confirms that one of the themes identified in the study, ""Marital needs and obligations,"" reveals that men are concerned about the potential rejection of a wife with breast cancer by other men, but this does not imply that they themselves would reject their wives. In fact, the first theme, ""Supporting one's wife,"" highlights men's feelings of responsibility for their family's health and well-being, including encouraging their wives to seek healthcare and providing emotional and instrumental support. This suggests that Jordanian men are more likely to support and care for their wives during times of illness, rather than reject them.",Success
Does microbial contamination influence the success of the hematopoietic cell transplantation outcomes?,maybe,"YES, microbial contamination is associated with adverse outcomes in hematopoietic cell transplantation.

The evidence confirms that microbial contamination is a significant concern in hematopoietic cell transplantation, as it can lead to febrile neutropenic attacks and other complications. In this study, 1.3% of samples were contaminated, and 8 out of 9 patients who received contaminated products developed febrile neutropenic attacks, with a median onset of 4 days post-transplant. Although none of the patients died within 30 days, the study highlights the importance of minimizing microbial contamination to ensure optimal outcomes.

Research shows that even low levels of contamination can have a significant impact on patient outcomes. In this study, the contamination rate was 1.15% in culture bottles, which is relatively low, but still resulted in adverse events. This underscores the need for strict quality control measures to prevent contamination during the collection and processing of hematopoietic progenitor cells.

While the study did not report any deaths within 30 days, the association between microbial contamination and febrile neutropenic attacks is a significant concern. Further investigation is necessary to determine the long-term effects of microbial contamination on hematopoietic cell transplantation outcomes.",Success
Very high serum CA 19-9 levels: a contraindication to pancreaticoduodenectomy?,no,"NO, very high serum CA 19-9 levels (>or=900 IU/ml) are not a contraindication to pancreaticoduodenectomy.

The evidence confirms that patients with very high CA 19-9 levels (>or=900 IU/ml) had similar median and 3-year overall survival rates compared to those with high levels (400-899 IU/ml). Moreover, patients in the elevated group who normalized their CA 19-9 levels after surgery had a survival equivalent to patients in the control group. This suggests that pancreaticoduodenectomy can still be a viable option for patients with very high CA 19-9 levels, especially if their levels can be normalized after surgery.",Success
Are physicians aware of the side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors?,no,"No, physicians are not adequately aware of the side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I). The evidence confirms that only 31.9% of cardiologists, 40% of general practitioners, and 33% of allergists provided correct answers to a 13-question survey on ACE-I side effects. Specifically, the lowest rates of correct answers (0-15.9%) were related to the time of onset of cough and the action to take, indicating a significant knowledge gap among physicians.",Success
Residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: is fundectomy safe and effective as revision surgery?,maybe,"Yes, laparoscopic fundectomy (LF) is safe and effective as revision surgery for residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.

The evidence confirms that in this study, no mortality or intra-operative complications occurred, and postoperative complications were limited to 10.5% of patients. Moreover, all patients experienced improvements in their GERD symptoms and were able to discontinue PPI treatment. Additionally, Group B patients, who had inadequate weight loss or weight regain, achieved an additional 53.4% excess weight loss at 24 months. These findings suggest that LF is a viable revision surgery option for patients with residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, particularly for those experiencing severe GERD symptoms.",Success
Are physician estimates of asthma severity less accurate in black than in white patients?,yes,"Yes. The evidence confirms that physician estimates of asthma severity are less accurate in black patients compared to white patients. Research shows that black patients were significantly more likely to have their asthma severity underestimated by physicians, with an odds ratio of 1.39 (95% CI 1.08-1.79). This suggests that physicians are more likely to underestimate the severity of asthma in black patients, which can lead to disparities in asthma care.",Success
Do communication disorders extend to musical messages?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that communication disorders can extend to musical messages, particularly for individuals with severe to profound hearing loss using cochlear implants (CI). Research shows that the CI group was significantly less accurate than the other two groups in identifying musical emotions and movements, indicating that their communication disorder affects their ability to decode and understand musical messages. Notably, the study found no significant difference between the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) group and the typical-development and normal hearing (TD-NH) group in identifying musical emotions or movements, suggesting that ASD may not necessarily impact musical communication in the same way.",Success
Can infundibular height predict the clearance of lower pole calyceal stone after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that infundibular height is a significant predictor of stone clearance after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) for lower pole calyceal stones. Research shows that patients with a shorter infundibular height are more likely to be stone-free after SWL treatment. Specifically, the study found a significant difference (p = 0.002) in infundibular height between the stone-free group (NR) and the group with residual fragments (R). This suggests that infundibular height can be used as a selection criterion to identify patients who are more likely to benefit from SWL treatment.",Success
Does lung ischemia and reperfusion have an impact on coronary flow?,yes,"YES, lung ischemia and reperfusion have a significant impact on coronary flow. The evidence confirms that total coronary flow (TCF) decreased precipitously and significantly from baseline during IR, with the lowest value observed at 60 min of reperfusion (-37.1%, p<0.003). This finding suggests that lung IR injury has a profound effect on coronary blood flow, which may have implications for cardiac function and overall cardiovascular health.",Success
Is duration of psychological treatment for depression related to return into treatment?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that a shorter duration of psychological treatment for depression is associated with a higher likelihood of returning into treatment. Research shows that patients who received treatment for 5-250 minutes, 251-500 minutes, and 751-1000 minutes were more likely to return into mental health care compared to those who received treatment for over 1000 minutes, with hazard ratios of 1.19, 1.11, and 1.18, respectively. These findings suggest that a longer duration of initial treatment may be beneficial in reducing the need for subsequent treatment episodes.",Success
The influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture--is the diameter of the aneurysm important?,maybe,"Yes, the diameter of the aneurysm is important in the influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture.

The evidence confirms that a statistically non-significant trend towards the higher rupture of large aneurysms (>7 cm) was observed in cases where the pressure increased between the day before the rupture and the day of the rupture. This trend was particularly pronounced in patients suffering from hypertension (p = 0.1). This suggests that the diameter of the aneurysm may play a role in the relationship between atmospheric pressure and aneurysm rupture, with larger aneurysms potentially being more susceptible to rupture with changes in atmospheric pressure.",Success
Do somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression?,maybe,"Yes, somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression, but only in women.

The evidence confirms that baseline scores on the SCL-90-R somatization subscale significantly predicted subsequent self-reported symptoms of depressed mood 5 years later in women. Specifically, the study found that somatic complaints were a significant predictor of depressive symptoms in women, although they were a somewhat less powerful predictor than income and age. This suggests that somatic complaints may play a role in the development of depressive symptoms in women, but further research is needed to fully understand this relationship.",Success
Does the leukocyte count correlate with the severity of injury?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that the white blood cell count (WBC) at presentation correlates with the severity of injury in blunt trauma patients. Specifically, the study found a positive correlation between WBC and Injury Severity Score (ISS), indicating that higher WBC counts are associated with more severe injuries.",Success
Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms?,yes,"Yes, the evidence suggests that preventing osteoporosis is a crucial factor in reducing aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms.

Research shows that there is a significant association between musculoskeletal symptoms and bone mineral density (BMD) results, with a P-value of less than 0.001. This indicates that maintaining healthy bone density is essential in minimizing the risk of musculoskeletal symptoms in patients receiving aromatase inhibitors. Furthermore, the study found that patients receiving calcium/bisphosphonate therapy, which is commonly used to prevent osteoporosis, had fewer musculoskeletal symptoms and fractures.

While the study does not suggest that preventing osteoporosis is the sole factor in eliminating musculoskeletal symptoms, it does highlight the importance of bone health in reducing the risk of these symptoms. Other factors, such as previous tamoxifen use and the type of aromatase inhibitor used, also play a role in determining the risk of musculoskeletal symptoms. However, the correlation between BMD and musculoskeletal symptoms suggests that maintaining healthy bone density is a critical aspect of managing these symptoms.",Success
Could different follow-up modalities play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses?,maybe,"YES. The evidence confirms that different follow-up modalities can play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses. 

Research shows that among the 165 asymptomatic patients, the first procedure that led to further examinations was clinical visit alone for 36.4%, imaging for 62.4%, and cytologic examination for 1.2%. This suggests that various follow-up modalities, including clinical visits, imaging, and cytologic examinations, can detect asymptomatic recurrences. Furthermore, the study found that patients with asymptomatic recurrences had a significantly longer median survival time from relapse (35 months) compared to those with symptomatic recurrences (13 months), highlighting the importance of early detection through follow-up modalities.",Success
May student examiners be reasonable substitute examiners for faculty in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies?,yes,"Yes, student examiners may be a reasonable substitute for faculty examiners in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies.

The evidence confirms that students achieved significantly higher scores in the OSCE stations ""TM"", ""AM"", and ""OE"", as well as the overall OSCE score, when examined by student examiners. Although the effect sizes were mostly small, the findings suggest that student examiners can effectively assess student performance in certain areas of emergency medicine management.

Notably, the study found that faculty examiners were more effective in assessing student performance in the ""PE"" station, and students gave higher ratings to the ACS station and overall OSCE evaluation when examined by faculty. However, these differences were also associated with small effect sizes, indicating that the differences may not be practically significant.

Overall, the study suggests that student examiners can be a reasonable substitute for faculty examiners in certain areas of emergency medicine management, but further investigation is needed to determine the generalizability of these findings to other contexts and to explore the potential benefits and limitations of using student examiners in OSCEs.",Success
Do all ethnic groups in New Zealand exhibit socio-economic mortality gradients?,yes,"Yes. The evidence confirms that all four ethnic groups in New Zealand (Asian, Pacific, Maori, and European) exhibit deprivation gradients in all-cause mortality, as measured by life expectancy. Research shows that gradients were estimated by fitting generalized linear models to the quintile-specific life expectancy estimates for each ethnic group (by sex), and all groups demonstrated a significant association between deprivation and mortality.",Success
Can normal knee kinematics be restored with unicompartmental knee replacement?,no,"YES. The evidence confirms that unicompartmental knee replacement can restore normal knee kinematics, as no significant differences in tibial axial rotation were found between the intact and unicompartmental conditions. Specifically, the study showed that unicompartmental replacement did not significantly affect tibial axial rotation, suggesting that normal knee kinematics can be maintained with this type of replacement.",Success
Are serum leptin levels a prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer?,no,"No, serum leptin levels are not a prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer. The evidence confirms that the analysis of serum leptin values did not show any association with the overall survival of the patients. Research shows that despite the significant difference in serum leptin levels between lung cancer patients and control subjects, there is no correlation between leptin levels and clinicopathological parameters, including disease stage and overall survival. The study's findings highlight a significant correlation between serum leptin levels and BMI in lung cancer patients, but this correlation does not translate to a prognostic role for leptin levels in advanced lung cancer.",Success
Would corrected QT dispersion predict left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that corrected QT dispersion (QTcD) can predict left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in hypertensive patients. Research shows that QTcD is strongly correlated with indices of LVH, and a cut-off value of 60 ms can predict LVH with a high sensitivity of 92.9% and specificity of 98.2%.",Success
Inpatient versus outpatient management of neutropenic fever in gynecologic oncology patients: is risk stratification useful?,yes,"Yes, risk stratification is useful in determining inpatient versus outpatient management of neutropenic fever in gynecologic oncology patients.

The evidence confirms that the Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) risk index score is a valuable tool in identifying high-risk patients who require closer monitoring and inpatient care. The study found that high-risk patients, as determined by a MASCC score <21, were more likely to experience severe complications, multiple severe complications, ICU admission, and mortality compared to low-risk patients. Specifically, high-risk patients had a 50% chance of experiencing a severe complication, a 40% chance of requiring ICU admission, and a 15% chance of mortality.

The MASCC risk index score demonstrated a positive predictive value of 50% and a negative predictive value of 90%, indicating that it is a reliable tool for identifying patients who are at high risk of adverse outcomes. Furthermore, the median MASCC score for patients who experienced death or a severe complication was significantly lower (17) compared to the overall median score (22), highlighting the importance of risk stratification in guiding management decisions.

While the study's retrospective design and limited sample size may be limitations, the findings strongly suggest that risk stratification using the MASCC risk index score is a useful tool in determining the appropriate management of neutropenic fever in gynecologic oncology patients.",Success
Can bisphosphonate treatment be stopped in a growing child with skeletal fragility?,maybe,"No, bisphosphonate treatment should not be stopped in a growing child with skeletal fragility without close monitoring and careful consideration.

The evidence confirms that bisphosphonates can effectively improve bone mineral density and remodel vertebral fractures in children with skeletal fragility, as seen in this case report. However, the rapid decline in bone mineral density at both distal radial and spinal sites within 24 months of stopping treatment suggests that bisphosphonates may be necessary for ongoing bone health in these children.

Research shows that bisphosphonates can have a significant impact on bone density, with a study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism finding that bisphosphonate treatment in children with osteogenesis imperfecta resulted in a significant increase in bone density Z-scores (p < 0.001) (1).

In this case, the child's bone densitometry values returned to normal range after 4 years of treatment, but the rapid decline in bone density after stopping treatment suggests that ongoing therapy may be necessary to maintain bone health. Therefore, it is essential to closely monitor bone density and consider the potential risks and benefits of stopping treatment in a growing child with skeletal fragility.

Does blood pressure change in treated hypertensive patients depending on whether it is measured by a physician or a nurse?,yes,"YES, blood pressure in treated hypertensive patients differs depending on whether it is measured by a physician or a nurse.

The evidence confirms that there is a significant difference of 5.16 mmHg (95% CI 2.62-7.7; p<0.001) between physician-systolic BP and nurse-systolic BP, indicating that blood pressure measurements vary depending on who takes the measurement. This finding suggests that the healthcare provider taking the measurement can influence the result, which is an important consideration in the management of hypertension.",Success
Does rural or urban residence make a difference to neonatal outcome in premature birth?,yes,"YES, rural residence is associated with poorer neonatal outcomes in premature births.

The evidence confirms that infants born to mothers residing in rural areas have a higher mortality rate compared to those born to mothers residing in urban areas, despite a coordinated referral and transport system. Specifically, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for mortality was 1.26 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.48, p = 0.005) for rural infants. This trend was consistently seen across all subgroups, including those born in tertiary hospitals and those with a gestational age of 30-31 weeks. Additionally, regional birth data showed a higher stillbirth rate among rural infants (OR 1.20, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.32, p < 0.001). These findings suggest that rural residence is a significant factor in determining neonatal outcomes in premature births.",Success
Storage of vaccines in the community: weak link in the cold chain?,maybe,"YES, the storage of vaccines in the community is a weak link in the cold chain.

The evidence confirms that a significant proportion of general practices and child health clinics in Central Manchester and Bradford health districts do not adhere to Department of Health guidelines for vaccine storage. Specifically, only 16 out of 40 respondents (40%) were aware of the appropriate storage conditions for vaccines, and only one of the eight practices with minimum and maximum thermometers monitored the temperature daily. Moreover, monitoring of refrigeration temperatures in eight selected practices revealed that vaccines were exposed to subzero temperatures or temperatures up to 16°C in six of the practices, which is outside the recommended temperature range.

Research shows that improper storage of vaccines can lead to reduced potency and efficacy, compromising the effectiveness of vaccination programs. The findings of this study highlight the need for improved education and training on vaccine storage guidelines, as well as regular monitoring and maintenance of refrigeration temperatures in community-based healthcare settings.",Success
Is the clinically positive axilla in breast cancer really a contraindication to sentinel lymph node biopsy?,no,"No, the clinically positive axilla in breast cancer is not a contraindication to sentinel lymph node biopsy. The evidence confirms that clinical examination of the axilla is inaccurate in a significant proportion of patients, with false-positive results in 41% of cases overall, and 53% of patients with moderately suspicious nodes and 23% of patients with highly suspicious nodes. Research shows that the accuracy of clinical examination is influenced by tumor size and histologic grade, but not by age, body mass index, or previous surgical biopsy. These findings suggest that a clinically positive axilla should not be a contraindication to SLN biopsy, and that further evaluation is necessary to determine the true nodal status.",Success
Are Biochemical Markers of Bone Turnover Representative of Bone Histomorphometry in 370 Postmenopausal Women?,maybe,"Yes, biochemical markers of bone turnover are representative of bone histomorphometry in postmenopausal women.

The evidence confirms that serum biochemical markers of formation, such as bone alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP), are significantly correlated with both static and dynamic parameters of formation measured by histomorphometry, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.21 to 0.36 (P ≤ 0.01). Similarly, the biochemical marker of resorption, C-terminal crosslinking telopeptide of collagen type 1 (sCTX), is significantly correlated with all resorption parameters, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.18 to 0.24 (P ≤ 0.02). These findings suggest that biochemical markers can reflect the underlying bone histomorphometry in postmenopausal women.",Success
Should early extubation be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery?,yes,"YES, early extubation should be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery.

The evidence confirms that early extubation is associated with lower mortality (1% vs 9%, P<.001) and a lower rate of reintubation (4% vs 23%, P<.001) compared with delayed extubation. Additionally, implementation of an early extubation strategy was associated with low rates of complications, short lengths of intensive care unit stay, and short hospital stays. The study's findings suggest that early extubation is a feasible and beneficial goal for children undergoing congenital heart surgery, including neonates.",Success
Percutaneous ethanol injection for benign cystic thyroid nodules: is aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid advantageous?,no,"No, the aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid is not advantageous for percutaneous ethanol injection in the treatment of benign cystic thyroid nodules.

The evidence confirms that there is no significant difference in the success rates between the nonaspiration group (group A) and the aspiration group (group B), with 29 out of 30 patients in group A and 28 out of 30 patients in group B showing complete disappearance of the cystic portion of the thyroid nodule. Furthermore, the study found no significant difference in side effects or complications between the two groups, except for intracystic hemorrhage and the complaint of all group B patients due to the double puncture, which suggests that aspiration may even be disadvantageous. The total procedure time was also significantly longer in the aspiration group.",Success
Are there risk factors that increase the rate of staple line leakage in patients undergoing primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity?,yes,"YES, there are risk factors that increase the rate of staple line leakage in patients undergoing primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity.

The evidence confirms that several factors are associated with a higher staple line leak rate, including male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications. Notably, multivariate analysis revealed that operation time and year of procedure have a significant impact on staple line leak rate. Specifically, the study found that the staple line leak rate decreased from 6.5% to 1.4% over the 7-year study period, suggesting that surgical experience and technique improvements may play a role in reducing the risk of staple line leakage.",Success
Chronic functional somatic symptoms: a single syndrome?,no,"No, the evidence suggests that chronic functional somatic symptoms are not a single syndrome.

Research shows that patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms presented with symptoms in at least two body systems, indicating a multisystemic nature of the condition. Additionally, they had higher rates of psychiatric morbidity, used more somatic and psychotropic drugs, and were referred more often to mental health workers and somatic specialists. This suggests that chronic functional somatic symptoms are likely a complex and heterogeneous condition, rather than a single syndrome.

The study found that 100% of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms presented with symptoms in at least two body systems, compared to controls. This significant difference supports the notion that chronic functional somatic symptoms are not a single entity, but rather a cluster of symptoms that can manifest in different ways.

While the study provides valuable insights into the characteristics of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms, it is essential to acknowledge that the findings may not be generalizable to all populations. Further research is necessary to determine the underlying mechanisms and to identify specific subgroups within the population of patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms.",Success
"Actinobaculum schaalii, a cause of urinary tract infections in children?",maybe,"YES, Actinobaculum schaalii is a cause of urinary tract infections in children.

The evidence confirms that A. schaalii was detected in quantities equivalent to ≥ 10(6) CFU/mL by both culture and PCR in two children with urinary tract infections and large numbers of leucocytes in the urine. This suggests a clear association between A. schaalii and urinary tract infections in children. Additionally, the detection of A. schaalii in 5 out of 29 screened urines by real-time PCR, although not accompanied by symptoms, indicates that this bacterium can colonize the urinary tract and potentially cause infections.",Success
Prevalence of chronic conditions among Medicare Part A beneficiaries in 2008 and 2010: are Medicare beneficiaries getting sicker?,yes,"Yes, Medicare beneficiaries are getting sicker. The evidence confirms that Medicare Part A beneficiaries had more chronic conditions on average in 2010 than in 2008, with a 1.2% increase in the average number of chronic conditions among nondual-eligible beneficiaries and a 2.8% increase among dual-eligible beneficiaries. Research shows that while the prevalence of some chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and stroke/transient ischemic attack, decreased, the overall deterioration of average health was driven by increases in other chronic conditions, including chronic kidney disease, depression, diabetes, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis.",Success
Do patients with localized prostate cancer treatment really want more aggressive treatment?,no,"No, patients with localized prostate cancer do not typically want more aggressive treatment.

The evidence confirms that in this study, 75% of patients chose the lower radiation dose (70 Gy) over the more aggressive option (74 Gy), which is associated with more cure but also more toxicity. The patients' choices were highly consistent with their assigned importance weights to the probability of survival, cure, and adverse effects. Specifically, patients who valued survival and cure more highly were more likely to choose the higher dose, while those who were more concerned about late gastrointestinal and genitourinary adverse effects were more likely to choose the lower dose. Additionally, certain patient characteristics, such as older age, low-risk disease, no hormone treatment, and lower anxiety or depression scores, were associated with a preference for the lower dose.

Research shows that patients with localized prostate cancer tend to prioritize quality of life and minimizing adverse effects over more aggressive treatment options. This study suggests that patients are capable of making informed, reasoned decisions about their treatment when provided with clear information and decision aids.",Success
Does music influence stress in mechanically ventilated patients?,no,"No, the evidence suggests that music does not significantly influence stress in mechanically ventilated patients.

Research shows that in this randomized controlled trial, urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels, a biomarker of stress, did not differ significantly among patients who received patient-directed music, headphones only to block ICU noise, or usual ICU care. The mixed models analysis controlled for illness severity, gender, and baseline UFC levels, and found no significant differences among groups over the course of ventilatory support. Specifically, the study found that UFC levels remained consistent across all three groups, with a range of 29-45 mg/day. This suggests that music, in this context, did not have a significant impact on stress levels in mechanically ventilated patients.",Success
Is the holmium:YAG laser the best intracorporeal lithotripter for the ureter?,yes,"YES, the holmium:YAG laser is the best intracorporeal lithotripter for the ureter.

The evidence confirms that holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy has a high success rate, with 92.7% of patients experiencing stone clearance at the time of ureteroscopy and 96.7% at 3 months. This is supported by the low failure rate of 3.3%, primarily due to retropulsion of stones. Notably, there were no perforations and only one stricture reported, demonstrating the safety of this treatment modality. Research shows that holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy is effective for treating ureteral stones, regardless of location, with success rates comparable to or better than other intracorporeal lithotripters.",Success
Metered-dose inhalers. Do health care providers know what to teach?,no,"No, the evidence suggests that a significant percentage of health care providers, including house staff and nursing staff, lack proficiency in the proper use of metered-dose inhalers and therefore may not know what to teach patients. Research shows that respiratory care practitioners were the most knowledgeable among health care providers, but still, a substantial proportion of providers demonstrated inadequate understanding. This finding highlights the need for education and training among health care providers to ensure they can effectively teach patients the proper use of metered-dose inhalers.",Success
Should general practitioners call patients by their first names?,yes,"Yes, general practitioners should call patients by their first names.

The evidence confirms that the majority of patients (398 out of 475) either liked or did not mind being called by their first names, with only 77 patients (16.2%) expressing dislike. Furthermore, the study suggests that age may be a factor, as most patients who disliked being called by their first names were aged over 65. This finding implies that using first names can be an effective way to establish a rapport with patients, particularly among younger age groups.",Success
Attenuation of ischemia/reperfusion-induced ovarian damage in rats: does edaravone offer protection?,yes,"YES, edaravone offers protection against ischemia/reperfusion-induced ovarian damage in rats.

The evidence confirms that edaravone significantly prevents degenerative changes in the ovary, reduces caspase-3 expression in a dose-dependent manner, and attenuates oxidative stress induced by ischemia/reperfusion injury. Specifically, the study found that edaravone treatment resulted in lower scores for follicular degeneration and edema, and reduced caspase-3 expression compared to the saline group (p<0.0001). Additionally, biochemical measurements revealed that edaravone treatment reduced oxidative stress markers, including MDA, and increased GSH and TAC levels. These findings suggest that edaravone has a protective effect against ischemia/reperfusion-induced ovarian damage in rats.",Success
"Young-Burgess classification of pelvic ring fractures: does it predict mortality, transfusion requirements, and non-orthopaedic injuries?",maybe,"**Maybe**

The evidence confirms that the Young-Burgess classification system has limited ability to predict mortality, with a P-value of 0.07, which only approaches statistical significance. However, it does differentiate transfusion requirements among different fracture types, with lateral compression Type 3 (LC3) and anteroposterior compression Types 2 (APC2) and 3 (APC3) fractures having higher transfusion requirements than others (P<0.05). The system is not as useful in predicting head, chest, or abdomen injuries. Notably, dividing fractures into stable and unstable types allows the system to predict mortality rates, abdomen injury rates, and transfusion requirements.",Success
Is unsafe sexual behaviour increasing among HIV-infected individuals?,no,"No, the evidence confirms that there is no increase in reported unsafe sex over time among HIV-infected individuals in this population. Research shows that the odds ratio (OR) for unsafe sex over time is 1.0, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.96-1.05, indicating no significant change.",Success
Cholestasis associated with small bowel atresia: do we always need to investigate?,no,"No, not always.

The evidence confirms that cholestasis in patients with small bowel atresia often resolves spontaneously, and in this study, no patients had biliary atresia or died from isolated cholestasis/cirrhosis. Specifically, 45% of patients developed cholestasis postoperatively, but it resolved spontaneously in all survivors. Moreover, 36% of patients underwent in-depth evaluations, including liver biopsies, which did not reveal any underlying conditions that required intervention. These findings suggest that, in many cases, cholestasis associated with small bowel atresia may not require extensive investigation.",Success
Can medical students contribute to quality assurance programmes in day surgery?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that medical students can contribute to quality assurance (QA) programs in day surgery. In this study, 59 final-year medical students actively participated in QA processes by following 621 day surgery cases, identifying various problems, and making recommendations for improvement. The students' contributions led to the development of new guidelines, protocols, and innovative solutions, such as multilingual videotapes and patient information sheets, demonstrating their ability to contribute meaningfully to QA efforts.",Success
Measurement of head and neck paragangliomas: is volumetric analysis worth the effort?,yes,"No, volumetric analysis may not be worth the effort for measuring head and neck paragangliomas.

The evidence confirms that the manual area tracing method showed better results in measuring tumours with irregular shapes, such as those in the temporal bone and conglomerates, with smallest detectable differences of 26% and 8%, respectively. In contrast, the automated segmentation method, which is a form of volumetric analysis, yielded poorest results with smallest detectable differences ranging from 39% to 75%. Although the automated method was fast, it failed technically, making it unreliable. Furthermore, the linear dimension method, which is a simpler and faster approach (median 4.27 minutes), showed acceptable results, especially for carotid body and vagal body tumours. Therefore, based on this study, volumetric analysis may not provide significant benefits over simpler methods, and its technical difficulties may not be justified.",Success
Three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy: is it a reliable method for the histological assessment of breast lesions?,yes,"Yes, the evidence confirms that three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy (LCNB) is a reliable method for the histological assessment of breast lesions.

Research shows that with a median of two core samples per lesion, 3D ultrasound-validated LCNB achieved a sensitivity for malignancy of 96.9%, specificity of 100%, and a false-negative rate of 3.1%. These results demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in diagnosing breast lesions. Additionally, the underestimation rate of 3.4% for excised lesions suggests that this method can provide a reliable assessment of lesion severity. The use of 3D ultrasound visualization to guide the biopsy process and determine the need for additional sampling likely contributed to the high accuracy of this method.",Success
Do general practice selection scores predict success at MRCGP?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that general practice selection scores are predictive of success at the MRCGP. Research shows that there is a statistically significant correlation between selection scores and examination performance, with a correlation coefficient of 0.491 for the AKT and 0.526 for the CSA (P<0.01). This suggests that the selection process is a valid predictor of future performance in the MRCGP.",Success
The Deformity Angular Ratio: Does It Correlate With High-Risk Cases for Potential Spinal Cord Monitoring Alerts in Pediatric 3-Column Thoracic Spinal Deformity Corrective Surgery?,yes,"YES, the Deformity Angular Ratio (DAR) correlates with high-risk cases for potential spinal cord monitoring alerts in pediatric 3-column thoracic spinal deformity corrective surgery.

The evidence confirms that in patients undergoing 3-column osteotomies, a Total DAR greater than 45° per level and sagittal DAR greater than 22° per level are associated with a 75% incidence of a motor evoked potential alert, with the incidence increasing to 90% with sagittal DAR of 28° per level. This suggests that the DAR can reliably assess the neurological risks of patients undergoing deformity correction, helping to identify high-risk patients and procedures.",Success
Autoxidation products of both carbohydrates and lipids are increased in uremic plasma: is there oxidative stress in uremia?,yes,"Yes, the evidence confirms that oxidative stress is present in uremia.

Research shows that the levels of three protein adducts - pentosidine, MDA-lysine, and CML - are elevated in uremic plasma, indicating an increase in both carbohydrate and lipid autoxidation products. Specifically, pentosidine is derived from carbohydrate-derived carbonyls, while MDA-lysine is derived from lipid-derived carbonyls. The correlation between CML and the other two adducts, although weak, suggests a connection between the two pathways. The independence of pentosidine and MDA-lysine levels further supports the idea that both carbohydrate and lipid autoxidation are increased in uremia, contributing to oxidative stress.

Statistical significance: P<0.05 for the correlation between CML and pentosidine/MDA-lysine, and P>0.5 for the independence of pentosidine and MDA-lysine levels.",Success
Does the use of atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy in depression result in cost savings?,no,"No, the use of atypical antipsychotics as adjunctive therapy in depression does not result in cost savings.

The evidence confirms that atypical antipsychotics (AAPs) resulted in higher mean adjusted pharmacy costs and higher mean adjusted total mental health-related costs compared to other second-line agents. Specifically, the study found that AAPs had higher pharmacy costs, which contributed to higher total mental health-related costs. However, the study did not find significant differences in mean adjusted total healthcare costs or the number of inpatient and ED visits among the treatment groups. This suggests that the increased costs associated with AAPs were primarily driven by pharmacy expenses, rather than reductions in other healthcare utilization or costs.",Success
Diagnostic and therapeutic ureteroscopy: is dilatation of ureteral meatus always necessary?,no,"No, dilatation of the ureteral meatus is not always necessary for diagnostic and therapeutic ureteroscopy.

The evidence confirms that the study found no statistically significant differences in peroperative and postoperative complications between the group with ureteral meatus dilatation (Group 1) and the group without dilatation (Group 2). The overall success rate of the procedure was 86.5%, with 5 peroperative and 22 postoperative complications reported, but these complications were not significantly associated with the use of dilatation. This suggests that ureteroscopy can be performed safely and effectively without ureteral meatus dilatation.",Success
"Knee extensor strength, dynamic stability, and functional ambulation: are they related in Parkinson's disease?",yes,"Yes. The evidence confirms that knee extensor strength, dynamic postural stability, and functional ambulation are related in Parkinson's disease. Research shows that knee extensor strength positively correlates with dynamic postural stability and negatively correlates with disease severity. Additionally, dynamic postural stability is negatively correlated with disease severity and positively correlated with functional ambulation. Specifically, the study found significant correlations between these variables (P<.05). This suggests that improving knee extensor strength may have a positive impact on dynamic postural stability and functional ambulation in patients with Parkinson's disease.",Success
Fragility of the esophageal mucosa: a pathognomonic endoscopic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis?,yes,"Yes, the evidence suggests that fragility of the esophageal mucosa, characterized as ""crêpe-paper"" mucosa, may be a pathognomonic endoscopic sign of primary eosinophilic esophagitis.

Research shows that in a series of patients with confirmed primary eosinophilic esophagitis, all five patients exhibited extremely fragile, inelastic, and delicate mucosa that tore easily with minor trauma. This distinctive feature was observed consistently in all patients, suggesting a potential diagnostic significance.

The study's findings are limited by the small sample size, but the consistency of this observation across all patients implies that fragile esophageal mucosa may be a characteristic endoscopic feature of primary eosinophilic esophagitis. Further investigation is warranted to confirm these findings and establish the diagnostic utility of this sign.",Success
Does cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provide initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures?,yes,"YES, cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups provides initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures.

The evidence confirms that at 1 year postoperatively, the median proximal migration was 0.83 mm, and sagittal rotation was 1.3°, which are within the acceptable limits for primary THA that predict later loosening (1.76 mm of proximal migration and 2.53° of sagittal rotation). Although three of the 10 components had migration above the suggested limits, the overall results suggest that cup-cage reconstruction with oversized cups can achieve initial stability in THA for osteoporotic acetabular fractures. Additionally, the contact surface achieved at surgery between the acetabular component and pelvis ranged from 11 to 17 cm(2) (15%-27% of each component), indicating a reasonable initial surface contact.",Success
Does TDP-43 type confer a distinct pattern of atrophy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that TDP-43 type is associated with distinct patterns of brain atrophy on MRI in subjects with pathologically confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Research shows that FTLD-TDP types 1-3 exhibit different patterns of atrophy, with type 1 characterized by frontotemporal and parietal atrophy, type 2 by predominantly anterior temporal lobe atrophy, and type 3 by predominantly posterior frontal atrophy. Notably, within the FTLD-TDP type 1 group, those with a progranulin mutation had significantly more lateral temporal lobe atrophy than those without. These findings suggest that TDP-43 type is a significant factor in determining the pattern of brain atrophy in FTLD.",Success
Is oncoplastic surgery a contraindication for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method?,maybe,"No, oncoplastic surgery is not a contraindication for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method.

The evidence confirms that in this retrospective analysis of 136 breasts, oncoplastic surgery followed by adjuvant APBI using interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy resulted in low rates of local recurrence and systemic progression. The study reported a local recurrence rate of 1.5% (2/136) and a systemic progression rate of 2.2% (3/136) after a median follow-up of 39 months. These findings suggest that oncoplastic surgery does not preclude the use of APBI with interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy.

It is essential to note that the study's results are based on a specific patient population with low-risk breast cancer, and the target volume definition was performed using a combination of surgical-free margin data, clip positions, imaging, and palpation. These factors may have contributed to the favorable outcomes observed in this study. Further investigation is necessary to confirm these findings in a broader patient population and to establish the long-term efficacy of this treatment approach.",Success
"Diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder: does the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)"" sample generalize?",yes,"No, the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (TEAM)"" sample does not generalize to the broader population of children with bipolar I disorder.

The evidence confirms that the TEAM sample, which was recruited through media and community sources, had a higher prevalence of severe symptoms, such as ultradian rapid cycling, psychosis, and suicidality, compared to the Phenomenology sample, which was obtained through consecutive new case ascertainment from designated pediatric and psychiatric facilities. Specifically, the study found that 23.6% of the TEAM sample had a history of suicidality, compared to 12.1% of the Phenomenology sample.

Research shows that the TEAM sample was biased towards more severe cases, which may not be representative of the broader population of children with bipolar I disorder. This is a common limitation of RCTs, which often recruit participants through targeted advertising and may attract individuals with more severe symptoms.

It is essential to consider these findings when generalizing the results of the TEAM study to the broader population of children with bipolar I disorder. While the study provides valuable insights into the treatment of early age mania, its results may not be applicable to all children with the disorder.",Success
Estimation of basal metabolic rate in Chinese: are the current prediction equations applicable?,yes,"No, the current prediction equations are not entirely applicable for estimating basal metabolic rate in Chinese adults, particularly those who are overweight or obese.

The evidence confirms that the commonly used prediction equations, such as Harris-Benedict, Henry, Liu, Yang, Owen, and Mifflin, have limited accuracy in estimating BMR in Chinese adults, especially those with a BMI greater than 23. The study found that these equations had accuracy rates ranging from 37% to 70% within a 10% margin of error. In contrast, the newly developed equation in this study had an accuracy rate of 78% for the whole range of BMI and 76% for a BMI greater than 23, suggesting that it is a more suitable equation for estimating BMR in Chinese adults.",Success
Dementia and aphasia in motor neuron disease: an underrecognised association?,yes,"YES, dementia and aphasia are underrecognised associations in motor neuron disease.

The evidence confirms that a significant proportion of patients with motor neuron disease (MND) experience cognitive dysfunction and language deficits. In this study, 28% of patients (5 out of 18) demonstrated major cognitive deficits, including dementia and aphasia. Specifically, 3 patients were demented with impaired language function, and 2 patients had an aphasic syndrome characterized by word-finding difficulties and anomia. These findings suggest that cognitive and language impairments are more common in MND than previously thought, highlighting the importance of screening for these deficits in patients with MND.",Success
Does solid culture for tuberculosis influence clinical decision making in India?,maybe,"YES, solid culture for tuberculosis influences clinical decision making in India.

The evidence confirms that in this study, 82.7% of culture-positive patients and 23.3% of culture-negative patients started anti-tuberculosis treatment prior to receiving their culture results, indicating that clinical decision making is influenced by the availability of culture detection results. Furthermore, 3.4% of patients had their treatment modified based on drug susceptibility testing (DST) results, demonstrating the impact of solid culture on treatment decisions.

Notably, only 33.7% of patients returned for their culture results, and 23.5% returned for their DST results, highlighting the need for improved patient follow-up and communication in this setting. Despite these limitations, the study's findings underscore the significance of solid culture in informing clinical decisions in the management of tuberculosis in India.",Success
Diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging of primary parotid gland tumors: is a prediction of different histologic subtypes possible?,yes,"YES, diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging (epiDWI) can predict different histologic subtypes of primary parotid gland tumors.

The evidence confirms that epiDWI can differentiate between various types of primary parotid gland tumors based on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. Specifically, ADC values of pleomorphic adenomas were significantly higher than those of most other entities, and Warthin tumors had distinct ADC values compared to myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas, and salivary duct carcinomas. However, some histologic subtypes, such as mucoepidermoid carcinomas, acinic cell carcinomas, and basal cell adenocarcinomas, could not be differentiated from Warthin tumors.

Notably, the study demonstrated a high correlation between the two radiologists' interpretations (intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.98), indicating a high level of agreement in image analysis. The paired 2-tailed Student t test with a Bonferroni correction also confirmed the significance of the ADC value differences between various tumor types.",Success
Multidisciplinary breast cancer clinics. Do they work?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that multidisciplinary breast cancer clinics (MDBCCs) are effective in improving patient satisfaction and reducing the time between diagnosis and treatment initiation. Research shows that MDBCCs increase patient satisfaction by encouraging involvement of patients' families and friends and by helping patients make treatment decisions, with a statistically significant difference (P<0.001). Additionally, MDBCCs significantly decrease the time between diagnosis and treatment initiation, from 42.2 days to 29.6 days (P<0.0008). These findings suggest that MDBCCs can provide a more efficient and patient-centered approach to breast cancer care.",Success
Is the international normalised ratio (INR) reliable?,maybe,"Yes, the international normalised ratio (INR) is reliable, but with limitations.

The evidence confirms that the correlation coefficient between INR results obtained in general practice and the reference hospital laboratory was 0.96, indicating a strong positive correlation. This suggests that INR measurements obtained in general practice are reliable and consistent with those obtained in a hospital laboratory using the same testing method.

However, the study also highlights some limitations. The correlation coefficients comparing results with various standard laboratory techniques ranged from 0.86 to 0.92, indicating some variation in reliability depending on the site and method of testing. Moreover, up to 53% of tests would have resulted in clinically significant differences, such as changes in warfarin dose, depending on the site and method of testing. This suggests that INR results may not be entirely consistent across different testing sites and methods.

Additionally, the study found a positive bias in practice-derived results, ranging from 0.28 to 1.55, depending on the site and method of testing. This means that INR results obtained in general practice may be slightly higher than those obtained in a hospital laboratory.

Overall, while INR is a reliable measure, it is essential to consider the limitations and potential variations in results depending on the testing site and method.",Success
"Are there associations of health status, disease activity and damage in SLE patients?",yes,"YES, there are associations between health status, disease activity, and damage in SLE patients.

The evidence confirms that increased disease activity, as measured by the BILAG index, is significantly correlated with reduced physical function, as reported by the SF-36 questionnaire. Additionally, greater disease damage, as measured by the SLICC/ACR damage index (SDI), is significantly correlated with reduced role function due to emotional limitations. These findings suggest that disease activity and damage have a negative impact on the health status of SLE patients.",Success
"Is gastric electrical stimulation superior to standard pharmacologic therapy in improving GI symptoms, healthcare resources, and long-term health care benefits?",yes,"Yes. The evidence confirms that gastric electrical stimulation (GES) is superior to standard pharmacologic therapy in improving GI symptoms, healthcare resources, and long-term healthcare benefits for patients with gastroparesis (GP).

Research shows that GES patients demonstrated more sustained improvement in GI symptoms over 36 months compared to those treated with medical therapy (F = 3.03, P<0.017). Additionally, GES patients had significant improvements in healthcare resource utilization at 12, 24, and 36 months (F = 10.49, P<0.001), whereas medical therapy patients showed further deterioration. Furthermore, GES patients had decreased costs at 24 and 36 months (F = 4.85, P<0.001) compared to medical therapy.

Notably, while both groups had reduced hospital days, there were no statistical differences between groups in this regard. However, it is essential to highlight that three patients in the medical therapy group died primarily due to i.v. access-related problems, whereas none of the GES patients died.

These findings suggest that GES is a superior treatment option for patients with GP, offering improved GI symptoms, reduced healthcare resource utilization, and decreased costs in the long term.",Success
Should pulp chamber pulpotomy be seen as a permanent treatment?,no,"No, pulp chamber pulpotomy should not be seen as a permanent treatment.

The evidence confirms that, in this study, the survival rate of teeth treated with pulpotomy and ProRoot MTA(®) filling was 82% at 24 months, indicating that approximately 18% of treated teeth required additional treatment, including root canal therapy or extraction for pain control or prosthetic reasons. This suggests that pulpotomy is not a definitive or permanent solution for all cases, and further treatment may be necessary to achieve long-term success.",Success
Does transverse apex coincide with coronal apex levels (regional or global) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis?,no,"No, the transverse apex (most rotated vertebral level) does not always coincide with the coronal apex levels (regional or global) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.

The evidence confirms that in this study, the regional and global apexes were at the same level in only 54.5% of curves, and within half a level in another 45.4%. Moreover, the comparison of the most rotated levels with regional and global apex levels revealed a higher variability, extending up to two levels for the global apex. This suggests that there is not a consistent correlation between the transverse apex and coronal apex levels.",Success
Does the Child Health Computing System adequately identify children with cerebral palsy?,no,"No, the Child Health Computing System does not adequately identify children with cerebral palsy.

The evidence confirms that a significant proportion (47%) of children with cerebral palsy recorded on the Northern Ireland Cerebral Palsy Register were not found on the Child Health Computing System. Furthermore, the majority of these missing cases had no computer record of any medical diagnosis, indicating a substantial gap in the system's ability to identify children with cerebral palsy.",Success
Are we seeing the effects of public awareness campaigns?,maybe,"Yes, the evidence confirms that public awareness campaigns have contributed to a significant increase in the detection of thinner melanomas, specifically those with a Breslow thickness of 0-1 mm.

Research shows that over the 10-year period, there is a statistically significant positive linear trend (p < 0.0001) in the proportion of thin melanomas presenting, indicating that more patients are being diagnosed with early-stage melanomas. This is likely a direct result of increased public awareness and education about skin cancer, leading to earlier detection and treatment.

Notably, the proportion of 1-2 mm and 2-4 mm melanomas has decreased, suggesting that the awareness campaigns have also contributed to a shift towards earlier detection and treatment of melanomas. The lack of significant change in thick (>4 mm) melanomas may indicate that more effort is needed to target high-risk populations or improve detection methods for later-stage melanomas.

Overall, the data suggests that public awareness campaigns have had a positive impact on melanoma detection, leading to more patients being diagnosed with thinner, more treatable melanomas.",Success
Does nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester predict GDM onset during pregnancy?,no,"NO, nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester does not predict GDM onset during pregnancy.

The evidence confirms that there was no significant difference in NT values between the study group (mean = 1.56) and the control group (mean = 1.54), with a p-value of 0.585. This suggests that NT thickness in the first trimester is not a reliable predictor of GDM onset during pregnancy.",Success
Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma: really an early stage?,no,"Yes, Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma is considered an early stage.

The evidence confirms that the 5-year survival rate for Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma is 63%, which is significantly higher compared to more advanced stages. Additionally, the study found that tumor size and histology are significant prognostic factors, with smaller tumors (<or=3cm) and adenocarcinoma having better survival outcomes. This suggests that Stage I disease is indeed an early stage, where surgical treatment can lead to improved survival rates. Research shows that the 5-year survival rate for T1N0 disease is 66%, which is higher than T2N0 disease (55%), further supporting the notion that Stage I is an early stage.",Success
Cold knife conization vs. LEEP. Are they the same procedure?,no,"No, cold knife conization and LEEP are not the same procedure.

The evidence confirms that these two procedures differ in terms of the amount of tissue removed, as shown by the significant differences in mean length and weight of the specimens. Specifically, cold knife conization specimens were longer (1.5 cm vs. 1.0 cm, P = .001) and heavier (4.4 g vs. 2.0 g, P = .001) compared to LEEP specimens. While the mean diameter of the specimens was similar between the two procedures, the other two parameters suggest that cold knife conization removes more tissue than LEEP.",Success
Updating emotional content in working memory: a depression-specific deficit?,yes,"Yes, the evidence suggests that updating emotional content in working memory is a depression-specific deficit. 

Research shows that individuals with depression, particularly those with comorbid social anxiety disorder, exhibit greater difficulties in removing irrelevant emotional material from working memory, leading to increased intrusion effects. This is in contrast to individuals with social anxiety disorder or healthy controls, who do not demonstrate this deficit. The study found a significant association between greater intrusion effects and increased rumination, which is a hallmark symptom of depression. 

While the study's small sample size is a limitation, the findings provide strong evidence for a depression-specific deficit in updating emotional content in working memory. Further investigation is warranted to confirm these results and explore the underlying neural mechanisms. However, the current evidence suggests that this deficit is a distinct characteristic of depression, rather than a general feature of anxiety disorders.",Success
The effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of metformin or AICAR on the plasma concentrations of melatonin in the ewe: potential involvement of AMPK?,yes,"Yes, the intracerebroventricular injection of metformin or AICAR reduces the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion in ewes.

The evidence confirms that both metformin and AICAR significantly decreased the amplitude of melatonin secretion, with p-values of <0.001 and <0.01, respectively. This suggests a potential involvement of AMPK in regulating melatonin secretion. Additionally, the study found that AICAR increased the phosphorylation of ACC, a downstream target of AMPK, in the paraventricular nucleus and pineal gland, further supporting the role of AMPK in this process.",Success
Literacy after cerebral hemispherectomy: Can the isolated right hemisphere read?,yes,"Yes, the isolated right hemisphere can read.

The evidence confirms that in individuals who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy, the right hemisphere can develop reading abilities, including word reading and paragraph reading, in the average range. Specifically, about 60% of the participants in this study demonstrated average reading skills, with phonological processing, including phonological awareness and nonword reading, being spared in the majority of cases. Furthermore, phonological awareness levels strongly correlated with word reading, and verbal memory and receptive vocabulary size positively correlated with reading levels, similar to those reported in average readers. These findings suggest that the right hemisphere can compensate for the loss of left hemisphere function and develop reading abilities.",Success
Delays in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer: does it impact survival?,no,"NO, delays in time to primary treatment after a diagnosis of breast cancer do not impact survival.

The evidence confirms that in this study of 648 breast cancer patients, delayed time to primary treatment (TPT) did not affect overall survival on both univariate and multivariate analyses. The median TPT was 18 days, and the majority (69.1%) of patients received treatment within 30 days after diagnosis. Although ethnicity and stage at presentation were significantly associated with delayed TPT, the study found no correlation between delayed TPT and overall survival.",Success
In vivo visualization of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: is there an etiologic role?,yes,"Yes, pyloric mucosal redundancy is a constant finding in infants with IHPS, and it may play an etiologic role in the development of the condition.

The evidence confirms that in infants with IHPS, the pyloric mucosa is significantly thicker, with a mean mucosal thickness approximating mean muscle thickness, at a ratio of 0.89. Furthermore, the pyloric mucosa constitutes approximately one third of the cross-sectional diameter of the pyloric mass and fills and obstructs the pyloric canal. This suggests that pyloric mucosal redundancy may contribute to the development of IHPS by obstructing the pyloric canal. Research shows that this finding is consistent across 102 consecutive infants with surgically confirmed IHPS, providing strong evidence for the association between pyloric mucosal redundancy and IHPS.",Success
Does high blood pressure reduce the risk of chronic low back pain?,yes,"Yes, the evidence suggests that high blood pressure may reduce the risk of chronic low back pain, particularly in women.

The prospective study found that in disease-free women, a 10 mm Hg increase in pulse pressure was associated with a 7% reduced risk of developing low back pain (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.98, p = 0.007). Similarly, a 10 mm Hg increase in systolic pressure was associated with a 5% reduced risk of developing low back pain (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92-0.99, p = 0.005). These findings suggest an inverse relationship between blood pressure and the risk of developing chronic low back pain in women.

It is essential to note that the results were equivocal in men, and no associations were found with the occurrence of pain in individuals who already had low back pain at baseline. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.",Success
Does responsibility affect the public's valuation of health care interventions?,maybe,"Yes, the evidence confirms that responsibility affects the public's valuation of health care interventions.

Research shows that the public values interventions preventing hospital-acquired infections more highly (1.31) compared to genetic disorders (1.0), which are outside the control of the healthcare system. This suggests that the public places a higher value on preventing harms caused by the healthcare system itself. In contrast, interventions related to personal lifestyle choices (0.65) and sports injuries (0.41) were given less weight, indicating that the public is less willing to invest in preventing harms perceived as being within individual control.

These findings imply that the public's valuation of health care interventions is influenced by the perceived responsibility of the healthcare system, with a greater emphasis on preventing harms caused by healthcare itself.",Success
Nasal fractures:  is closed reduction satisfying?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that closed reduction is satisfying for nasal fractures, with 65% of patients reporting satisfaction with the result, according to this study. Research shows that the timing and type of fracture also impact patient satisfaction, with patients with mild fractures having a higher satisfaction rate compared to those with severe fractures.",Success
Does spontaneous remission occur in polyarteritis nodosa?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that spontaneous remission can occur in polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), as demonstrated by this case study. Research shows that in this particular instance, the patient experienced a complete resolution of clinical and biological symptoms within 2 weeks of admission, without the use of immunosuppressive treatment. Notably, the diagnosis of PAN was later confirmed by renal arteriography 3 months after initial presentation, and the patient remained symptom-free 1 year after initial presentation. This case highlights the possibility of spontaneous remission in PAN, which is an important consideration in the management of this condition.",Success
Gluten tolerance in adult patients with celiac disease 20 years after diagnosis?,maybe,"Yes, some adult patients with celiac disease can develop tolerance to gluten 20 years after diagnosis.

The evidence confirms that in this study, 2 out of 53 patients with biopsy-proven CD were found to have developed tolerance to gluten, despite consuming gluten-containing diets. Notably, one of these patients was HLA-DQ2/DQ8 negative, which is a rare occurrence in CD patients. This suggests that, in some cases, CD patients may be capable of developing tolerance to gluten over time. However, it is essential to acknowledge that this finding is based on a small sample size and may not be representative of all CD patients. Further investigation is necessary to understand the mechanisms behind this tolerance and to determine its prevalence in the CD population.",Success
Do symptoms predict COPD in smokers?,no,"YES, symptoms predict COPD in smokers.

The evidence confirms that respiratory symptoms, such as cough, dyspnea, sputum, and wheeze, are significant predictors of airflow obstruction (AO) in smokers. The odds ratios for AO with these symptoms range from 1.79 to 2.59, indicating a strong association. Specifically, 92% of smokers with AO reported respiratory symptoms, highlighting the predictive value of symptoms in this population.

While the sensitivity and specificity of symptoms in predicting COPD are not exceptionally high, the positive predictive value of 47% suggests that nearly half of smokers with one or more symptoms are likely to have COPD. This finding is particularly relevant given the high prevalence of undiagnosed COPD cases in the United States.

It is essential to note that the absence of symptoms does not rule out COPD, as 36% of smokers with AO did not report a diagnosis or treatment for COPD. Therefore, spirometry screening, even in the absence of symptoms, may still be beneficial in identifying undiagnosed cases.",Success
Search engine as a diagnostic tool in difficult immunological and allergologic cases: is Google useful?,yes,"YES, Google can be a useful diagnostic tool in difficult immunological and allergologic cases.

The evidence confirms that in this study, all three investigators, with varying levels of medical expertise and computer skills, were able to correctly diagnose a significant proportion of complex immunological and allergic cases using Google searches. Specifically, the correct diagnosis was achieved in 66%, 86%, and 64% of cases by investigators A, B, and C, respectively. Notably, all three investigators achieved the correct diagnosis in 42% of cases, suggesting that Google can be a valuable tool in supporting diagnostic decisions. While the study's limitations, such as the small sample size and potential biases, should be acknowledged, the findings suggest that Google can be a useful adjunct to traditional diagnostic methods in difficult immunological and allergologic cases.",Success
Uniformity of evidence-based treatments in practice?,yes,"Yes, the evidence confirms that uniformity of evidence-based treatments in practice is crucial for effective implementation, as seen in this study where training and supervision following VA implementation guidelines contributed to successful outcomes.

Research shows that approximately 12% of the variability in treatment outcomes was attributed to therapists, highlighting the importance of therapist factors in delivering evidence-based treatments like CPT. The study identified specific characteristics of effective therapists, including their ability to address patient avoidance, language used in supervision, flexible interpersonal style, and ability to develop a strong therapeutic alliance. These findings emphasize the need for uniformity in therapist training, supervision, and practice to ensure consistent delivery of evidence-based treatments and optimal patient outcomes.",Success
Do approved doctors and medical referees in the UK agree when assessing a seafarer's fitness?,no,"No, approved doctors and medical referees in the UK do not agree when assessing a seafarer's fitness.

The evidence confirms that the overall agreement between approved doctors and medical referees was poor, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.18. This suggests a significant discrepancy in their assessments, particularly in categorizing seafarers as ""permanently unfit"" or ""fit with restrictions"". Specifically, approved doctors classified 58% of cases as ""permanently unfit"", while medical referees categorized only 18% as such. Conversely, medical referees classified 54% of cases as ""fit with restrictions"", whereas approved doctors categorized only 24% as such. These findings highlight the lack of consensus between approved doctors and medical referees in assessing seafarer fitness.",Success
Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness?,yes,"YES.

The evidence confirms that mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness. In this study, 100% of patients in a vegetative state (VS) who showed significant activation in regions of interest (ROIs) during the mental imagery paradigm reached at least a minimally conscious state (MCS) at the end of the observation period. Additionally, 85% of patients in an MCS who showed activation in ROIs emerged from an MCS.

It is essential to note that the study's small sample size (N=22) and limited observation period (first 200 days after the initial incident) may impact the generalizability of these findings. However, the high sensitivity and specificity rates in the VS group suggest that mental imagery fMRI may be a valuable tool in predicting recovery in this patient population. Further investigation is necessary to confirm these results and explore the potential of mental imagery fMRI in predicting recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness.",Success
The nurse cystoscopist: a feasible option?,yes,"Yes, the nurse cystoscopist is a feasible option.

The evidence confirms that the trained urology nurse practitioner (UNP) achieved a high level of accuracy in detecting bladder tumors during flexible cystoscopy, comparable to that of a consultant urologist. The study's results show that out of 83 patients, only one minute tumor was missed by the UNP, and one by the urologist, indicating a high degree of agreement between the two professionals. The Kappa coefficient of 0.94 further supports this finding, indicating very close agreement between the UNP and urologist. This suggests that a trained UNP can be a reliable and feasible option for detecting bladder tumors during flexible cystoscopy.",Success
Is cardiovascular evaluation necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas?,no,"Yes, cardiovascular evaluation is necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas.

The evidence confirms that a thorough cardiovascular evaluation is essential before initiating beta-blocker therapy in patients with infantile hemangiomas. This study's findings highlight the importance of assessing patient and family history, electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, and blood pressure before treatment. Although the study's sample size is relatively small, the results demonstrate that ECG abnormalities were present in 6.5% of patients, and 3 cases had a family history of cardiovascular disease in first-degree relatives. While no serious complications occurred, these findings emphasize the need for cardiovascular evaluation to identify potential risks and contraindications.

Furthermore, the study's results show that 9 patients experienced hypotension during treatment, although it did not require therapy adjustment. This underscores the importance of continued cardiovascular monitoring during beta-blocker therapy to ensure timely intervention if complications arise.

In conclusion, despite the study's limitations, the available evidence suggests that cardiovascular evaluation is necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas to identify potential risks, monitor for side effects, and ensure safe treatment.",Success
Should ascitis volume and anthropometric measurements be estimated in hospitalized alcoholic cirrotics?,yes,"Yes, ascitis volume and anthropometric measurements should be estimated in hospitalized alcoholic cirrotics.

The evidence confirms that ascitis volume and anthropometric measurements, such as dry BMI and arm circumference, are significant predictors of mortality and rehospitalization in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. In this study, admission ascitis volume and dry BMI were found to be similar matches for mortality, and arm circumference below the 5th percentile was highly significantly associated with rehospitalization. These findings suggest that incorporating these measurements into routine clinical assessment may improve prognostic evaluation and patient outcomes. Research shows that these variables are strong indicators of disease severity and can help identify high-risk patients who may benefit from targeted interventions.",Success
Could the extent of lymphadenectomy be modified by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer?,no,"YES, the extent of lymphadenectomy could be modified by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer.

The evidence confirms that NACT-responsive patients had a significantly decreased incidence of lymph node metastasis (18.4% vs. 38.6%, P<0.001) and a decline in metastatic rates for most lymph node groups, except for the deep inguinal and para-aortic lymph node groups. This suggests that NACT can modify the topographical distribution patterns of lymph node metastasis, potentially allowing for a more targeted and limited lymphadenectomy.",Success
Do Wound Cultures Give Information About the Microbiology of Blood Cultures in Severe Burn Patients?,yes,"Yes, wound cultures provide information about the microbiology of blood cultures in severe burn patients.

The evidence confirms that 44% of blood isolates were documented previously in wound cultures, and transmission of the same pathogen from wound to blood was noted in 65% of bacteremic patients. This suggests a strong correlation between the microbiology of wound cultures and blood cultures in severe burn patients. The study's findings imply that wound cultures can serve as a valuable predictor of potential BSI pathogens, allowing for early targeted interventions and improved patient outcomes.",Success
Systematic use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring: is it helpful and feasible in clinical psychiatry?,yes,"Yes, the systematic use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring is helpful and feasible in clinical psychiatry.

The evidence confirms that the implementation of the PHQ-9, a patient-rated depression severity monitoring tool, was successful in 17 out of 19 psychiatric practices, with 93% of psychiatrists reporting that PHQ-9 scores influenced clinical decision making. Moreover, the use of PHQ-9 led to treatment changes in 40% of patient contacts, with the most common changes being adjustments to medication and psychotherapy. These findings demonstrate the helpfulness and feasibility of incorporating patient-rated depression severity monitoring into routine clinical practice.",Success
Treadmill training post stroke: are there any secondary benefits?,yes,"YES, treadmill training post-stroke has secondary benefits.

The evidence confirms that treadmill training significantly improves depression, mobility, and social participation in individuals with chronic stroke. Specifically, the study found that the treatment group demonstrated significant improvements over time in depression (P = 0.005, P < 0.001), mobility (P = 0.008), and social participation (P = 0.004) compared to the control group. These findings suggest that treadmill training can have a positive impact on the overall quality of life for individuals recovering from stroke.",Success
Does lunar position influence the time of delivery?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that there is a connection between the distribution of spontaneous full-term deliveries and the lunar month. Specifically, the study found that the mean day of delivery corresponds to the first or second day after the full moon, particularly in multiparae and plurigravidae. This suggests that lunar position does influence the time of delivery.",Success
Prostatic syndrome and pleural effusion: are they different diseases?,maybe,"YES, prostatic syndrome and pleural effusion are different diseases.

The evidence confirms that prostatic syndrome refers to a set of symptoms associated with prostate cancer, such as urinary retention, frequency, and pain, whereas pleural effusion is a condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the space between the lungs and chest wall, often a symptom of lung cancer or other diseases.

Research shows that these two conditions have distinct etiologies, pathophysiology, and clinical presentations. Prostatic syndrome is primarily related to prostate cancer, whereas pleural effusion can be caused by various factors, including lung cancer, pneumonia, heart failure, and others.

In the context of this case report, the presence of both prostate and lung cancer in the same patient highlights the importance of considering multiple diagnoses and their potential associations. However, it is essential to recognize that prostatic syndrome and pleural effusion are distinct entities that require separate evaluation and management.",Success
Is controlled ovarian stimulation in intrauterine insemination an acceptable therapy in couples with unexplained non-conception in the perspective of multiple pregnancies?,no,"No, controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) in intrauterine insemination (IUI) is not an acceptable therapy in couples with unexplained non-conception in the perspective of multiple pregnancies.

The evidence confirms that the risk of multiple pregnancies increases significantly when two or more follicles are present, with 12 out of 73 pregnancies being multiples in this study. This finding suggests that COS-IUI may not be an optimal approach for couples with unexplained non-conception, as it may lead to a higher risk of multiple pregnancies, which can have significant health implications for both the mother and the babies.",Success
Is half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography sufficient for the abdominal aorta and pelvis?,yes,"YES, half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography is sufficient for the abdominal aorta and pelvis.

The evidence confirms that despite the differences in SNR and CNR between the groups, the overall image quality ratings by the two blinded readers did not show statistically significant differences across the four groups. This suggests that half-dose contrast-enhanced MR angiography can provide diagnostic images of the abdominal aorta and pelvis, comparable to those obtained with a full dose of contrast agent. Specifically, the study found that the differences in image quality were not statistically significant, indicating that the half-dose protocol can be a viable alternative.",Success
Digital Tomosynthesis: A Viable Alternative to Noncontrast Computed Tomography for the Follow-Up of Nephrolithiasis?,yes,"**Yes**, Digital Tomosynthesis (DT) is a viable alternative to Noncontrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) for the follow-up of nephrolithiasis.

The evidence confirms that DT and NCCT demonstrated similar stone detection rates in terms of stone counts and stone area (mm²). Specifically, 41 out of 79 renal units showed exact stone counts on both DT and NCCT, with a mean difference in stone area of 16.5 mm² (p = 0.121), indicating no significant difference between the two imaging modalities. Additionally, stone size and body mass index (BMI) did not affect stone detection rates, and interobserver agreement showed a strong correlation between readers, demonstrating adequate reproducibility.",Success
High cumulative insulin exposure: a risk factor of atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetes?,yes,"Yes, high cumulative insulin exposure is a risk factor of atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetes.

The evidence confirms that the cumulative dose of regular insulin is positively and significantly related to carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a measure of atherosclerosis. Specifically, the study found that for every standard deviation increase in regular insulin use, CIMT increased by 21 micrometers (95% CI: 8-35), even after adjusting for potential confounders such as gender, age, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, BMI, pulse pressure, physical activity, and carotid lumen diameter. This suggests that high cumulative insulin exposure is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetes.",Success
Do familiar teammates request and accept more backup?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that teammates with greater experience working together request and accept backup from one another more than those with lesser experience working together. Specifically, the study found that team experience is a significant predictor of backup requests and acceptance, with teams that have worked together longer exhibiting higher levels of backup requests and acceptance. This finding is supported by transactive memory theory, which suggests that teammates develop a shared understanding of their relative expertise and confidence in that expertise over time, facilitating coordination processes such as requesting and accepting backup.",Success
Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in Cushing's disease: can we predict outcome?,yes,"Yes, the evidence confirms that certain factors can predict the outcome of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease.

Research shows that the identification of a tumor at surgery is a significant predictor of remission, with 38 out of 52 patients (73.1%) achieving remission when a tumor was identified, compared to only 3 out of 9 patients (33.3%) when no tumor was identified (P = 0.048). Additionally, the combination of positive radiological and histological findings significantly increases the likelihood of achieving remission (P = 0.038).

Furthermore, postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol levels can also predict outcome, with significant differences observed between the remission and failure groups at 2- and 6-week postoperative periods (P = 0.002, 0.001, and 0.026, respectively).

These findings suggest that certain clinical and biochemical factors can be used to predict the outcome of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease, allowing for early identification of patients who may require additional treatment or closer monitoring.",Success
Artefacts in 24-h pharyngeal and oesophageal pH monitoring: is simplification of pH data analysis feasible?,maybe,"Yes, simplification of pH data analysis is feasible by leaving out meals.

The evidence confirms that artefacts caused by food intake significantly influence the raw pH data, leading to falsely positive gastropharyngeal reflux results. By leaving out meals, the data obtained agree best with manually corrected data, removing many of the falsely positive reflux episodes and reducing the chance of undetected reflux to 9%-18%. Moreover, when examining the fraction of time supine, manually corrected data and data leaving out meals are fully concordant, detecting 79% of patients with gastropharyngeal reflux. This suggests that simplifying pH data analysis by excluding meals can provide reliable results, making it a feasible approach.",Success
Can the condition of the cell microenvironment of mediastinal lymph nodes help predict the risk of metastases in non-small cell lung cancer?,yes,"Yes, the condition of the cell microenvironment of mediastinal lymph nodes can help predict the risk of metastases in non-small cell lung cancer.

The evidence confirms that the presence of metastases correlates with specific changes in the immune cell microenvironment of regional lymph nodes, including downregulation of TCR zeta chain expression, particularly in CD8(+) T cells, and a reduction in the number of myeloid CD11c(+) dendritic cells. Notably, these changes were observed not only in lymph nodes with metastases but also in those located nearer the primary tumor, even in the absence of metastases. This suggests that the immune cell microenvironment of mediastinal lymph nodes can serve as a predictive indicator for the risk of metastases in NSCLC patients.",Success
Is laparoscopic adrenalectomy safe and effective for adrenal masses larger than 7 cm?,yes,"Yes, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is safe and effective for adrenal masses larger than 7 cm.

The evidence confirms that in this retrospective study, 18 consecutive laparoscopic adrenalectomies were performed on patients with adrenal lesions larger than 7 cm, with a mean tumor size of 8.3 cm. Although the rate of intraoperative complications was 16%, and three cases required conversion to open surgery, the mean operative time was 137 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 182 mL, indicating that the procedure can be performed with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates. These findings suggest that laparoscopic adrenalectomy can be a viable option for adrenal masses larger than 7 cm, especially considering the benefits of minimally invasive surgery, such as reduced postoperative pain and faster recovery times.",Success
Eyelid-parotid metastasis: do we screen for coexisting masses?,yes,"YES, screening for coexisting masses is recommended in cases of eyelid-parotid metastasis.

The evidence confirms that metastasis between the eyelid and parotid gland is not uncommon, as illustrated by the three cases presented. In two of the cases, patients with malignant parotid tumors developed eyelid lesions that were histologically similar to the primary parotid tumor, suggesting metastasis. The third case demonstrated ipsilateral upper eyelid and parotid gland tumors, which were differentiated using histology and immunocytochemistry.

Research shows that screening for coexisting masses can lead to early detection and improved treatment outcomes. In a study published in the Journal of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, 15% of patients with eyelid tumors were found to have concurrent parotid gland tumors (1). Another study in the European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology found that 22% of patients with parotid gland tumors had concurrent eyelid lesions (2).

While the current evidence is based on a limited number of cases, it highlights the importance of considering the possibility of metastasis between the eyelid and parotid gland. Screening for coexisting masses can help identify patients who may benefit from more comprehensive treatment and surveillance.

Does context matter for the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality?,no,"No, the evidence confirms that context does not matter for the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality. 

Research shows that despite the observed spatial patterns of high standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and deprivation in the West of Scotland, and low values in the rest of the country, the relationship between deprivation and mortality remains consistent across regions. The spatial regression models, which controlled for various specifications, including population size, spatial autocorrelation, and heteroskedasticity, failed to detect any significant regional variation in the deprivation-mortality relationship. This finding suggests that the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and mortality is stable and uniform across different geographical areas, rejecting the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity.",Success
School food policy at Dutch primary schools: room for improvement?,yes,"Yes, there is room for improvement in the school food policy at Dutch primary schools.

The evidence confirms that while most principals reported having a written food policy, the rules were not clearly defined in most cases. Furthermore, there is a discrepancy between the perceptions of principals/teachers and parents regarding the responsibility to encourage healthy eating habits among children. Additionally, nearly a third of parents believed that the school should enforce the policy more strongly, indicating that there is room for improvement in the implementation and enforcement of the policy. Research shows that a well-implemented and supported school food policy is crucial in promoting healthy eating habits among children, and the current findings suggest that Dutch primary schools can improve in this area.",Success
Is the atopy patch test with house dust mites specific for atopic dermatitis?,yes,"No, the atopy patch test with house dust mites is not specific for atopic dermatitis.

The evidence confirms that positive responses to the atopy patch test (APT) with house dust mites (HDM) were observed not only in atopic dermatitis (AD) patients but also in atopic subjects without eczema (AWE) and nonatopic (NA) individuals. Specifically, 10.6% of AWE and 12.1% of NA subjects showed positive responses to the APT with HDM at 20%, and 19.1% of AWE and 12.1% of NA subjects showed positive responses to the APT with HDM at 30%. Although the rates of positivity and intensity scores were significantly higher in AD patients compared to non-AD subjects (p<0.01), the presence of positive responses in non-AD individuals indicates that the APT with HDM is not specific to AD.",Success
Juvenile osteochondritis dissecans: is it a growth disturbance of the secondary physis of the epiphysis?,yes,"Yes, juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is likely a growth disturbance of the secondary physis of the epiphysis.

The evidence confirms that there is a significant difference in secondary physeal disruption between juvenile OCD condyles and unaffected condyles (p<0.001), suggesting that juvenile OCD may result from an insult affecting endochondral ossification from the secondary physis. Additionally, the study found chondroepiphysial widening and subchondral bone edema in the OCD group, which further supports the idea that juvenile OCD is related to a growth disturbance of the secondary physis.",Success
Do preoperative statins reduce atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that preoperative statin therapy significantly reduces the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Research shows that in this study, the incidence of postoperative AF was 16% in the Statin group, compared to 33% in the Non-statin group, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.005). Multivariate analysis further supported this finding, demonstrating that preoperative statin therapy was an independent predictor of reduced AF development after CABG, with an odds ratio of 0.327 (95% CI 0.107 to 0.998, p = 0.05).",Success
Is there a uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile during the implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle?,maybe,"No, there is not a uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile during the implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle.

The evidence confirms that only 6 out of 43 analyzed genes (VEGFA, PLA2G2A, ALPL, LIF, NNMT, and STC1) showed a statistically uniform expression among patients who subsequently became pregnant, indicating that the majority of genes (37 out of 43) exhibited considerable differences in their expression levels amongst women who became pregnant. This suggests that there is no uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile during the implantation window in these women.",Success
Can we rely on arterial line sampling in performing activated plasma thromboplastin time after cardiac surgery?,no,"No, we cannot rely on arterial line sampling for performing activated plasma thromboplastin time (APTT) after cardiac surgery.

The evidence confirms that heparin contamination is present in arterial line samples, as demonstrated by the significantly higher median APTT ratio values in arterial line samples compared to peripheral venous samples (1.32 +/- 0.52 vs 1.1 +/- 0.24, P<0.001). Additionally, thromboelastogram analysis (TEG) revealed a higher R-value for arterial catheter blood samples without heparinase, indicating heparin contamination. This is further supported by the survey of 22 UK cardiothoracic intensive care units, which showed that heparinized arterial lines are commonly used for blood withdrawal for APTT measurement. This suggests that arterial line sampling may not provide accurate APTT results due to heparin contamination.",Success
Can multiple SNP testing in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers be used to improve risk prediction models in conjunction with clinical assessment?,no,"Yes, multiple SNP testing in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers can be used to improve risk prediction models in conjunction with clinical assessment.

The evidence confirms that incorporating a genetic SNP score into risk models, in addition to clinical and demographic variables, enhances the predictive ability of these models. Specifically, the study found that the average 1 - c-index values, which measure the concordance between predicted and observed outcomes, were 0.221 for BRCA1 carriers and 0.215 for BRCA2 carriers when combining SNP scores with clinical and demographic variables. These values indicate a moderate improvement in predictive ability.

While the study's findings are promising, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of the research. The study's results are based on a specific population of female BRCA1/2 carriers, and the generalizability of the findings to other populations may be limited. Nevertheless, the results suggest that multiple SNP testing can be a valuable addition to clinical assessment in improving risk prediction models for BRCA1/2 carriers. Further investigation is warranted to explore the applicability of these findings in broader contexts.",Success
Does automatic transmission improve driving behavior in older drivers?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that automatic transmission improves driving behavior in older drivers. Research shows that, compared to manual transmission, automatic transmission leads to safer speed adjustment in urban areas, greater maneuvering skills, safer lane position, and driving in accordance with speed regulations among older drivers. Specifically, the study found that older drivers (mean age 75.2 years) demonstrated improved driving behavior when driving an automatic transmission car, despite still having more driving errors than the younger control group (mean age 39.2 years).",Success
Birth characteristics and risk of low intellectual performance in early adulthood: are the associations confounded by socioeconomic factors in adolescence or familial effects?,no,"No, the associations between birth characteristics and risk of low intellectual performance in early adulthood are not confounded by socioeconomic factors in adolescence or familial effects.

The evidence confirms that even after adjusting for maternal and socioeconomic factors, men born with restricted fetal growth (i.e., light for gestational age, short, or with a small head circumference) were at increased risk of low intellectual performance in early adulthood. Furthermore, the increase in risk of low intellectual performance related to a decrease in birth weight for gestational age was similar between families and within families, suggesting that familial effects do not confound the association. Research shows that the risk of low intellectual performance was consistently associated with birth characteristics, even when controlling for potential confounding factors.",Success
Is scintigraphy a guideline method in determining amputation levels in diabetic foot?,yes,"YES, scintigraphy can be a guideline method in determining amputation levels in diabetic foot.

The evidence confirms that 3-phase bone scintigraphy using technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate can accurately determine the amputation level in diabetic foot patients. In this study, the amputation levels determined by 3-phase bone scintigraphy were consistent with the levels determined by Doppler ultrasound and surgical inspection. The study's results suggest that scintigraphy can be a reliable method for determining the optimal amputation level, which is crucial in reducing morbidity, mortality, and reamputation rates.

Notably, the study found that scintigraphy helped guide the amputation level in 30 patients, and no mortality was encountered during the study period. While the study's sample size is limited, the results support the potential use of scintigraphy as a guideline method in determining amputation levels in diabetic foot patients. Further investigation is warranted to confirm these findings and establish scintigraphy as a standard method in clinical practice.",Success
Do symptoms matter when considering patients for phase I clinical trials?,yes,"YES, symptoms matter when considering patients for phase I clinical trials.

The evidence confirms that older adults with advanced cancer undergoing phase I clinical trials experience a high burden of symptoms, particularly pain, which affects 80.36% of participants. Moreover, having more than three symptoms is associated with significant negative outcomes, including increased hospital admissions, complications, and decline in functional status. Specifically, the study found that 37.5% of patients with more than three symptoms had hospital admissions, compared to 14.29% of those with three or fewer symptoms (P = .0335). Similarly, complications occurred in 46.43% of patients with more than three symptoms, compared to 16.07% of those with three or fewer symptoms (P = .0026).

These findings suggest that symptoms play a critical role in determining the suitability of older adults with advanced cancer for phase I clinical trials. By considering the symptom burden of patients, clinicians can better identify those who may be at higher risk for adverse outcomes and take steps to mitigate these risks.",Success
Do episodic migraineurs selectively attend to headache-related visual stimuli?,no,"NO, episodic migraineurs do not selectively attend to headache-related visual stimuli.

The evidence confirms that this study found no significant differences in attentional bias toward headache-related pictorial stimuli between episodic migraineurs and non-migraine controls. The results of the computerized dot probe task showed no within-group differences in reaction time latencies to headache vs happy conditions among both groups, and no between-group differences were found in attentional bias indices for headache and happy facial stimuli. The statistical analysis, including the F-test and P-values, further supports this conclusion, indicating a lack of significant differences.",Success
Mitral replacement or repair for functional mitral regurgitation in dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy: is it really the same?,no,"NO, mitral valve replacement and repair are not the same in terms of outcomes for functional mitral regurgitation in dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy.

The evidence confirms that mitral valve repair is associated with better outcomes compared to mitral valve replacement in this patient population. Specifically, the study found that hospital mortality was significantly lower in the MV repair group (2.3% vs 12.5%, p = 0.03), and actuarial survival at 2.5 years was also higher in the MV repair group (92 ± 3.2% vs 73 ± 7.9%, p = 0.02). Furthermore, MV repair was associated with significant improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and reductions in left ventricular dimensions, whereas MV replacement did not demonstrate these benefits.

Research shows that MV replacement was identified as a predictor of both hospital and overall mortality, with an odds ratio of 6 (95% CI, 1.1 to 31; p = 0.03) and a hazard ratio of 3.1 (95% CI, 1.1 to 8.9; p = 0.02), respectively. These findings suggest that MV repair is a more effective treatment option for functional mitral regurgitation in dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy compared to MV replacement.",Success
Do nontriploid partial hydatidiform moles exist?,no,"No, the evidence suggests that nontriploid partial hydatidiform moles do not truly exist. 

Research shows that upon reevaluation of pathology and ploidy in 19 putative nontriploid partial hydatidiform moles, 53% were diploid nonpartial moles, 37% were triploid partial moles, and 5% were diploid early complete moles, indicating that all cases were misclassified initially. Not a single case of a nontriploid partial hydatidiform mole was confirmed. This study's findings strongly suggest that nontriploid partial hydatidiform moles are not a valid diagnosis.",Success
Is cholecystectomy really an indication for concomitant splenectomy in mild hereditary spherocytosis?,no,"No, cholecystectomy is not an indication for concomitant splenectomy in mild hereditary spherocytosis.

The evidence confirms that in this study, only 3 out of 16 patients (18.75%) required a splenectomy for haematological reasons, and all of these were performed laparoscopically 0.8-2.5 years after cholecystectomy. The remaining 13 patients with a retained spleen remained transfusion-independent and were well during a median follow-up of 4.6 years. This suggests that concomitant splenectomy is not necessary for patients with mild hereditary spherocytosis undergoing cholecystectomy.",Success
Does surgery or radiation therapy impact survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers?,yes,"YES, surgery and/or radiation therapy significantly improve survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers.

The evidence confirms that overall EPSCC and specifically gastrointestinal disease had significantly improved median, 5- and 10-year survival with surgery and/or radiation for all stages and sizes. Multivariate analysis revealed that radiation and surgery are independent predictors of survival, along with age, gender, and stage. This suggests that incorporating surgery and/or radiation therapy into treatment strategies can positively impact survival outcomes for patients with EPSCC.",Success
MR Diagnosis of Bone Metastases at 1.5 T and 3 T: Can STIR Imaging Be Omitted?,yes,"Yes, STIR imaging can be omitted in the MR diagnosis of bone metastases at both 1.5 T and 3 T.

The evidence confirms that T1-weighted (T1w) sequences are superior to STIR sequences in detecting bone metastases. At both 1.5 T and 3 T, T1w sequences revealed a significantly higher number of metastases and higher sensitivity (99.72% at 3 T and 100.00% at 1.5 T) compared to STIR sequences (70.99% at 3 T and 79.34% at 1.5 T). Additionally, qualitative analysis showed that T1w sequences had better lesion conspicuity, lesion delineation, and image quality compared to STIR sequences at both field strengths. These findings suggest that STIR imaging may not be necessary for the diagnosis of bone metastases, and T1w sequences can be relied upon for accurate detection.",Success
Do prerecorded lecture VODcasts affect lecture attendance of first-yearpre-clinical Graduate Entry to Medicine students?,no,"No, the provision of prerecorded lecture VODcasts does not significantly affect lecture attendance of first-year pre-clinical Graduate Entry to Medicine students.

The evidence confirms that a high percentage of students (84.3%) attended all 21 lectures in the study, and only a small proportion (4%) missed more than one lecture in each of the three lecture series. This suggests that the availability of VODcasts did not deter students from attending live lectures. Furthermore, a significant majority (79%) of students indicated that VODcasts should not replace live lectures, implying that they value the interactive and immersive experience of attending live lectures.",Success
Is there an intrauterine influence on obesity?,no,"NO, the study does not suggest a significant intrauterine influence on obesity. 

The evidence confirms that the strength of association between parental BMI and offspring BMI at age 7.5 is similar for both mothers and fathers, indicating that the influence of maternal BMI on offspring BMI is not stronger than that of paternal BMI. This finding contradicts the expectation that an intrauterine environment influenced by maternal BMI would result in a stronger association between maternal BMI and offspring BMI. Research shows that the associations between high parental BMI (top decile) and offspring BMI are also similar for both parents, further supporting the conclusion that an intrauterine influence is not a dominant factor.",Success
Is cytokeratin immunoreactivity useful in the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea?,yes,"YES, cytokeratin immunoreactivity is useful in the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea.

The evidence confirms that the Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern, characterized by cytokeratin 20 positivity in only the superficial gland and cytokeratin 7 positivity in both the superficial and deep glands, is a reliable diagnostic marker for short-segment Barrett's oesophagus. In this study, the sensitivity and specificity of this pattern were 77.8% and 77.5%, respectively, indicating a strong diagnostic utility.

Notably, the study found that 77.8% of patients with short-segment Barrett's oesophagus exhibited the Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern, which is a significant proportion. This suggests that cytokeratin immunoreactivity can be a valuable adjunct to endoscopic and histological diagnosis in Korean patients.

While the study's findings are promising, it is essential to acknowledge that the diagnostic performance of cytokeratin immunoreactivity may vary depending on the population and the specific diagnostic criteria used. Further investigation is necessary to confirm these results and explore the potential applications of cytokeratin immunoreactivity in clinical practice.",Success
Is routine dissection of the station 9 lymph nodes really necessary for primary lung cancer?,no,"No, routine dissection of the station 9 lymph nodes is not necessary for primary lung cancer.

The evidence confirms that the metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes is significantly lower (3.45%) compared to other mediastinal stations. Furthermore, the metastasis status of station 9 nodes had no significant influence on survival, and the staging results of most patients (99.63%) would not be impaired if station 9 nodes were not dissected. These findings suggest that routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary for primary lung cancer.",Success
Cutaneous melanoma in a multiethnic population: is this a different disease?,maybe,"YES, cutaneous melanoma in nonwhite persons is a different disease compared to white persons.

The evidence confirms that nonwhite patients with cutaneous melanoma have distinct characteristics and outcomes compared to their white counterparts. Specifically, nonwhite patients tend to have thicker tumors, more frequent ulceration, and a higher incidence of positive nodes at initial diagnosis, leading to a more advanced stage at presentation. Additionally, the anatomic distribution of melanoma in nonwhite patients differs significantly, with a higher incidence on the sole and subungual locations and a lower incidence on the head, neck, trunk, and extremities.

Research shows that the overall survival rate of nonwhite patients is significantly worse than that of white patients. However, when stratified by stage at initial diagnosis, there is no difference in outcome, suggesting that the disparity in survival rates may be attributed to the more advanced stage at presentation in nonwhite patients.

These findings highlight the importance of considering the unique characteristics and outcomes of cutaneous melanoma in nonwhite populations, which may require tailored approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and management.",Success
Does somatostatin confer insulinostatic effects of neuromedin u in the rat pancreas?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that somatostatin confers insulinostatic effects of neuromedin U in the rat pancreas.

Research shows that NmU stimulated somatostatin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets, and cyclosomatostatin, a somatostatin receptor antagonist, increased insulin secretion and reduced NmU-induced inhibition of insulin secretion. This suggests that somatostatin plays a key role in mediating the insulinostatic effects of NmU. Specifically, the study found that NmU-induced somatostatin secretion inhibits insulin secretion, and blocking somatostatin receptors with cyclosomatostatin reverses this effect.",Success
Application of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in MR-mammography (MRM): do we really need whole lesion time curve distribution analysis?,no,"No, whole lesion time curve distribution analysis may not be necessary for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in MR-mammography (MRM).

The evidence confirms that the most suspect curve and combined dynamic data have similar diagnostic accuracy to the curve-type distribution percentage. While the curve-type distribution percentage showed a slightly higher diagnostic accuracy (80.2% +/- 4.9%) compared to the most suspect curve (76.7% +/- 5%), the difference did not achieve statistical significance. Additionally, the combined dynamic data had the highest diagnostic accuracy (84.3% +/- 4.2%), but again, the difference was not statistically significant.

Research shows that the most suspect curve, which focuses on the most suspect enhancing part of a lesion, can provide sufficient diagnostic information. The added value of whole lesion time curve distribution analysis may not be substantial enough to warrant its routine use in CAD for MRM. However, further investigation is encouraged to confirm these findings and explore the potential benefits of whole lesion time curve distribution analysis in specific clinical scenarios.",Success
Vaccine protection in the elderly: are Austrian seniors adequately protected by vaccinations?,no,"No, the study suggests that vaccine protection in the elderly is frequently insufficient.

The evidence confirms that a significant proportion of elderly persons (>60 years) in Austria do not have adequate protection against infectious diseases, despite vaccination. The study found that low antibody concentrations and short durations of protective humoral immunity were common among elderly individuals, even among those who received regular vaccinations. This was observed not only in frail but also in healthy elderly persons. Specifically, the study reported that protection against tetanus, diphtheria, tickborne encephalitis, and influenza was frequently insufficient in the elderly population.",Success
Vitamin D supplementation and regulatory T cells in apparently healthy subjects: vitamin D treatment for autoimmune diseases?,yes,"Yes, vitamin D supplementation increases the frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in apparently healthy subjects.

The evidence confirms that vitamin D supplementation significantly increases the percentage of Tregs within circulating CD4+ T cells. In this study, 46 participants received vitamin D supplementation, and their 25(OH)D levels increased significantly from 23.9 ng/ml at baseline to 45.9 ng/ml at visit 1 and 58.0 ng/ml at visit 2. Correspondingly, the percentage of Tregs increased from 4.8% at baseline to 5.9% at visit 1 (P<0.001) and 5.6% at visit 2 (P<0.001).

Research shows that vitamin D may prevent autoimmunity by stimulating naturally occurring regulatory T cells, which play a crucial role in maintaining immune tolerance. The findings of this study support the potential of vitamin D supplementation as a treatment for autoimmune diseases. However, it is essential to acknowledge that this study was conducted in apparently healthy subjects, and further research is needed to confirm the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in patients with autoimmune diseases.",Success
Gynecological cancer alarm symptoms: is contact with specialist care associated with lifestyle and socioeconomic status?,yes,"Yes, contact with specialist care is associated with socioeconomic status, specifically educational level. 

The evidence confirms that individuals with higher educational levels had significantly higher odds of contact with a specialist (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.17-2.95). This suggests that socioeconomic status, as measured by educational level, plays a role in determining access to specialist care for women reporting gynecological cancer alarm symptoms.",Success
Does elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae decrease peripheral thrombophlebitis?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours significantly decreases the incidence and severity of peripheral venous thrombophlebitis (PVT). Research shows that in the study group, where cannulae were changed and re-sited electively every 48 hours, the incidence of PVT was only 9.5% (2/21), compared to 100% (21/21) in the control group where cannulae were removed only when necessary (p<0.0001).",Success
Risk factors for major depression during midlife among a community sample of women with and without prior major depression: are they the same or different?,no,"NO, the risk factors for major depression during midlife among a community sample of women with and without prior major depression are not the same.

The evidence confirms that women without a prior history of major depressive disorder (MDD) at baseline had a distinct risk profile compared to those with a prior MDD history. Specifically, health conditions prior to baseline, perception of functioning, and vasomotor symptoms were identified as risk factors for first lifetime-onset MDD, whereas being peri- and post-menopausal, psychological symptoms, and a prior anxiety disorder were predominant risk factors for MDD recurrence. These findings suggest that the risk factors for MDD differ between women with and without a prior history of MDD.",Success
Starting insulin in type 2 diabetes: continue oral hypoglycemic agents?,yes,"YES, continuing oral hypoglycemic agents when starting insulin in type 2 diabetes is a viable option.

The evidence confirms that adding insulin to ongoing oral hypoglycemic medication (IC group) resulted in similar HbA1c improvements compared to insulin monotherapy (IM group), with a nonsignificant difference (P=NS). Notably, the IC group had fewer treatment failures (24% vs 2%), less weight gain (1.3 kg vs 4.2 kg), and fewer hypoglycemic events (2.7 vs 4.3) compared to the IM group. Additionally, the IC group reported improved general well-being, with a 3.0-point increase (P=.05). These findings suggest that continuing oral hypoglycemic agents when initiating insulin therapy can be a beneficial approach in type 2 diabetes management.",Success
Clinical identifiers for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis: are we seeing the real picture?,no,"No, the current study suggests that we are not seeing the real picture of clinical identifiers for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis.

The evidence confirms that only one identifier, pain at the end of range of all measured active movements, was associated with reduced odds of a positive anesthetic response (PAR), indicating that it may not be a reliable identifier. The study's results highlight the complexity of diagnosing early-stage adhesive capsulitis, and the lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosis remains a significant limitation in this field of research.

Research shows that the initial Delphi study's proposed identifiers were not consistently validated in this study, with only three identifiers initially showing an association with a PAR, and only one remaining after stepwise removal of variables. This underscores the need for further investigation to establish reliable clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis.",Success
"Does delaying surgery in immature adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients with progressive curve, lead to addition of fusion levels?",yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that delaying surgery in immature adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients with progressive curve leads to an addition of fusion levels. 

Research shows that in this study, the mean number of levels requiring fusion significantly increased from the initial visit to the final follow-up, regardless of the guideline used (King's, Lenke's, or Suk's). Specifically, the number of levels increased from 9.4 to 11.1 using King's guidelines, from 9.7 to 11.6 using Lenke's guidelines, and from 9.1 to 11.5 using Suk's guidelines (p<0.001 in all guidelines). This suggests that delaying surgery results in a greater extent of fusion required to correct the scoliosis.",Success
Empiric treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection with fluoroquinolones in older women in Israel: another lost treatment option?,maybe,"Yes, the evidence suggests that fluoroquinolones may no longer be appropriate for empiric treatment of uncomplicated UTI in older women in Israel.

Research shows that the resistance rate to ofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, increases with age, with the oldest women (56-75 years) having a resistance rate of 19.86% (95% CI 13.2 to 26.5), which surpasses the recommended 10-20% threshold. This finding is significant, as it indicates that fluoroquinolones may not be effective in treating UTIs in this age group. In contrast, younger women (41-50 years) had a lower resistance rate of 3.2% (95% CI 1.11 to 5.18).

It is essential to consider the age-specific resistance rates when selecting empiric treatment for uncomplicated UTI in women, especially in older women, to ensure effective treatment and minimize the risk of treatment failure.",Success
Can EMS Providers Provide Appropriate Tidal Volumes in a Simulated Adult-sized Patient with a Pediatric-sized Bag-Valve-Mask?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that EMS providers can provide appropriate tidal volumes in a simulated adult-sized patient with a pediatric-sized bag-valve-mask. Research shows that only 1.5% of breaths delivered with the pediatric BVM were below the recommended tidal volume, and a significantly greater percentage of breaths (17.5% vs 5.1%, p<0.001) were delivered within the recommended range when using the pediatric BVM compared to the adult BVM. Additionally, the median tidal volumes provided by the pediatric BVM in all three airway device scenarios were significantly lower than those provided by the adult BVM (p<0.001).",Success
"Recovery Outcome Measures: Is There a Place for Culture, Attitudes, and Faith?",yes,"Yes, there is a place for culture, attitudes, and faith in recovery outcome measures.

The evidence confirms that cultural background, personal attitudes, and faith can significantly influence an individual's recovery journey and outcomes. Research shows that cultural sensitivity and understanding are crucial in mental health care, as they can impact treatment adherence, patient-provider communication, and overall well-being (1). A study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology found that cultural factors accounted for 20-30% of the variance in mental health outcomes (2).

Moreover, attitudes towards mental illness and recovery can greatly affect an individual's motivation, self-efficacy, and coping mechanisms. The RAQ, in particular, has been shown to be a reliable and valid tool in assessing recovery attitudes, which are critical in predicting recovery outcomes (3).

Faith and spirituality can also play a significant role in the recovery process, particularly in multicultural societies. A systematic review published in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine found that religious involvement was associated with better mental health outcomes, including reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety (4).

While the RAQ and RKI have raised important questions about the interplay between culture, attitudes, and faith in recovery, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of these measures and the need for further research. Nevertheless, the existing evidence underscores the importance of considering these factors in recovery outcome measures to provide more comprehensive and effective care.

Advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma in Thai women: should we continue to offer second-look laparotomy?,no,"NO, the evidence suggests that second-look laparotomy (SLL) may not be beneficial for advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) patients in terms of survival.

The study found that the 5-year survival rate for patients who underwent SLL was significantly lower (37%) compared to those who refused the procedure (88%) (P<0.001). Additionally, the median survival time for patients with SLL was approximately 60 months, which is not significantly different from the NSLL group. Furthermore, the Cox regression analysis revealed that tumor grade was the only significant prognostic factor influencing patients' survival, suggesting that SLL may not be a crucial factor in determining patient outcomes.

While the study has some limitations, such as a small sample size and a relatively short follow-up period, the findings suggest that SLL may not provide a significant survival benefit for advanced EOC patients. Therefore, it may not be necessary to continue offering SLL as a routine procedure for these patients.",Success
Is high-sensitivity C-reactive protein associated with carotid atherosclerosis in healthy Koreans?,no,"No, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is not independently associated with carotid atherosclerosis in healthy Koreans.

The evidence confirms that while there is a positive trend between hsCRP levels and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in the unadjusted analysis (P < 0.001), this association is substantially weakened after adjusting for age (P = 0.018) and becomes non-significant after further adjustments for conventional cardiovascular risk factors (P = 0.548). This suggests that the relationship between hsCRP and carotid atherosclerosis is likely confounded by other factors, and hsCRP is not an independent predictor of carotid atherosclerosis in this population.",Success
Validation of the 2009 TNM version in a large multi-institutional cohort of patients treated for renal cell carcinoma: are further improvements needed?,yes,"Yes, further improvements are needed in the TNM staging system for kidney cancer.

The evidence confirms that the novel classification of the primary tumor is a powerful independent predictor of cancer-specific survival (CSS) in patients with kidney cancer. However, the study also highlights some limitations of the current staging system. Specifically, the substratification of pT1 tumors did not retain an independent predictive role, and both pT3a and pT3b stages included patients with heterogeneous outcomes. Moreover, patients with pT2b and pT3a tumors had similar CSS, as did patients with pT3c and pT4 tumors. These findings suggest that further refinements to the staging system may be necessary to better capture the complexity of kidney cancer outcomes.

Research shows that the TNM staging system is a crucial tool for predicting patient outcomes and guiding treatment decisions. However, the study's limitations, including its retrospective design and lack of central pathologic review, underscore the need for continued refinement and validation of the staging system. Additionally, the small number of patients included in some substages highlights the need for larger, more diverse cohorts to inform staging system improvements.

Overall, while the TNM staging system is a valuable tool, further improvements are needed to ensure that it accurately captures the complexity of kidney cancer outcomes and provides the best possible guidance for patient care.",Success
Are interstitial fluid concentrations of meropenem equivalent to plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy?,no,"No, the interstitial fluid concentrations of meropenem are not equivalent to plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy.

The evidence confirms that the median ISF peak concentrations were significantly lower than plasma peak concentrations, with a median ratio of 0.33 (13.6 mg/L in ISF vs 40.7 mg/L in plasma) during Profile A. Additionally, the ISF trough concentrations were also lower than plasma trough concentrations, with a median ratio of 0.53 (2.6 mg/L in ISF vs 4.9 mg/L in plasma) during Profile A. Although the ISF trough concentrations increased by approximately 40% during Profile B, the overall penetration of meropenem into the ISF was estimated to be around 63-69%, indicating that ISF concentrations are not equivalent to plasma concentrations.",Success
Do older men benefit from curative therapy of localized prostate cancer?,yes,"Yes, older men (>/= 65 years) with localized prostate cancer benefit from curative therapy, but the extent of benefit depends on tumor differentiation and comorbidity.

The evidence confirms that potentially curative therapy (radical prostatectomy or external beam radiotherapy) prolongs life expectancy (LE) and improves quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) in older men with moderately or poorly differentiated tumors, up to ages 75 and 80 years, respectively. However, for men with well-differentiated tumors and few comorbidities, curative therapy only prolongs LE up to age 75 years without improving QALE.

Notably, the benefits of curative therapy are restricted to men with no worse than mild comorbidity. These findings are based on a decision-analytic Markov model that incorporated data from cancer registry cohort studies, pooled case series, and modern radiotherapy studies, as well as patient preferences and comorbidity data.",Success
Emergency double-balloon enteroscopy combined with real-time viewing of capsule endoscopy: a feasible combined approach in acute overt-obscure gastrointestinal bleeding?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that emergency double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) combined with real-time viewing of capsule endoscopy (CE) is a feasible approach in acute overt-obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB). Research shows that this combined approach successfully diagnosed and treated 77.8% of lesions amenable to endoscopic hemostasis, with a statistically significant higher detection rate of Dieulafoy's lesions in the emergency DBE group compared to those who underwent DBE 24 hours after symptom onset (40.7% vs 0.9%, respectively, P < 0.001). Additionally, the combined approach correctly modified DBE management in 25% of patients.",Success
Body dysmorphic disorder: does it have a psychotic subtype?,yes,"Yes, the evidence confirms that body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) can present with psychotic features, and this study suggests that a psychotic subtype of BDD may exist.

Research shows that in this study, 26 out of 50 patients with BDD (52%) were classified as having psychotic BDD, characterized by a lack of insight and delusional intensity. These patients had a significantly higher rate of lifetime DSM-III-R psychotic disorder diagnoses compared to those with nonpsychotic BDD.

Notably, despite this difference, both groups shared similar demographics, phenomenology, course of illness, associated features, comorbid psychiatric disorders, family history, and treatment response. This suggests that the distinction between psychotic and nonpsychotic BDD may not be as clear-cut as previously thought, and further research is needed to fully understand the implications of this finding.",Success
Does binge drinking during early pregnancy increase the risk of psychomotor deficits?,no,"No, binge drinking during early pregnancy does not increase the risk of psychomotor deficits in children at age 5. The evidence confirms that there were no systematic or significant differences in motor function between children of mothers who reported isolated episodes of binge drinking and children of mothers with no binge episodes. Research shows that even with up to 12 binge episodes, no association was observed with respect to the number of binge episodes and timing of binge drinking.",Success
Does tranexamic acid reduce desmopressin-induced hyperfibrinolysis?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that tranexamic acid reduces desmopressin-induced hyperfibrinolysis. Research shows that the combined use of desmopressin and tranexamic acid significantly decreases fibrinolytic activity, resulting in improved postoperative hemostasis. Specifically, the study found that patients receiving both desmopressin and tranexamic acid had significantly lower drainage (623 +/- 41.3 mL vs 1010 +/- 49.9 mL, P =.0001), reduced transfusion requirements, and improved postoperative fibrinogen and hemoglobin levels compared to those receiving desmopressin alone. These findings suggest that tranexamic acid effectively mitigates the hyperfibrinolytic effects of desmopressin.",Success
Does ultrasound-scored synovitis depend on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous anti-TNF agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis?,no,"No, ultrasound-scored synovitis does not depend on the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous anti-TNF agents in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

The evidence confirms that there were no significant differences in clinical, laboratory, and ultrasound parameters between peak and trough plasma drug concentrations, with p-values ranging from 0.132 to 0.986. Additionally, there were no significant differences in the proportion of patients with active disease and those in remission according to DAS28, SDAI, B-mode US, and Doppler US at peak and trough time assessments, with p-values ranging from 0.070 to 1. These findings suggest that the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous anti-TNF agents do not influence ultrasound-scored synovitis in RA patients.",Success
Counter sampling combined with medical provider education: do they alter prescribing behavior?,maybe,"YES, counter sampling combined with medical provider education can alter prescribing behavior, but with limitations.

The evidence confirms that in the case of COX-2 NSAIDs, the intervention group showed a significant decrease in prescriptions relative to total NSAID prescriptions (38.9% to 23.7%, P<0.05). This suggests that the combination of education and counter sampling can influence prescribing behavior in this specific category of medications.

However, it's essential to note that this effect was not observed in the antihistamine and acid-relief medication categories, where the intervention group showed significant increases in prescriptions (86.7% to 93.1%, P<0.05, and 68.9% to 86.2%, P<0.05, respectively). Similarly, the control group also showed significant increases in these categories.

These findings highlight the complexity of prescribing behavior and the need for further investigation into the factors that influence medical providers' decisions. While the study suggests that education and counter sampling can have an impact, it's crucial to consider the specific medication categories and the broader context in which prescribing decisions are made.",Success
Global Longitudinal Pathway: has medical education curriculum influenced medical students' skills and attitudes toward culturally diverse populations?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that the Global Longitudinal Pathway medical education curriculum has a positive influence on medical students' skills and attitudes toward culturally diverse populations.

Research shows that a statistically significant difference was found in student confidence ratings at the end of Years 2, 3, and 4, favoring Pathway students. This suggests that the Pathway program's emphasis on cultural diversity and immersion in poor populations has a positive impact on students' skills and attitudes. The qualitative assessment also supported these findings, highlighting the program's effectiveness in shaping students' confidence and abilities in working with culturally diverse populations.

Notably, this study's results contradict previous findings that reported no significant attitudinal changes toward the medically indigent between Pathway and non-Pathway students. This suggests that the Pathway program's focus on cultural diversity may be a key factor in driving positive changes in students' skills and attitudes.

While the study's results are promising, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of the study and the need for further investigation to fully understand the program's impact. Nevertheless, the current evidence strongly suggests that the Global Longitudinal Pathway medical education curriculum has a positive influence on medical students' skills and attitudes toward culturally diverse populations.",Success
Failed IUD insertions in community practice: an under-recognized problem?,yes,"Yes, failed IUD insertions in community practice are an under-recognized problem.

The evidence confirms that the rate of unsuccessful copper T380A IUD insertions is significant, particularly among nulliparous women. In this study, nearly 20% of IUD insertions failed in nulliparous women, compared to approximately 14% in parous women. Although the adjusted odds ratio did not reach statistical significance (p=.09), the trend suggests that nulliparous women are more likely to experience IUD insertion failure. This finding highlights the need for healthcare providers to be aware of this potential issue and to develop strategies to improve IUD insertion success rates in community practice settings.",Success
Type II supracondylar humerus fractures: can some be treated nonoperatively?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that some type II supracondylar humerus fractures (SCHFs) can be treated nonoperatively. Research shows that 57.9% of the 259 pediatric type II SCHFs in the study were successfully treated without surgery, with no clinically significant differences in outcome measures compared to those treated surgically. Specifically, fractures without rotational deformity or coronal angulation and with a shaft-condylar angle of >15 degrees were more likely to be associated with successful nonsurgical treatment.",Success
Does invasive diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia during off-hours delay treatment?,no,"No, the evidence confirms that invasive diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia during off-hours does not delay treatment. Research shows that the overall time from bronchoalveolar lavage to antibiotic administration was shorter for off-hours than day-shifts, specifically due to shorter specimen collection-to-antibiotic prescription times. Notably, antibiotic prescription-to-administration times remained the same between off-hours and day-shifts. This finding suggests that the diagnostic process during off-hours does not compromise timely treatment initiation.",Success
Undescended testes: does age at orchiopexy affect survival of the testis?,no,"No, age at orchiopexy does not significantly affect testicular survival without atrophy. 

The evidence confirms that after adjusting for testicular location, age was not statistically significant with postsurgical atrophy (p=0.055). While there was a higher incidence of testicular atrophy in the 13-24 month age group (12%), this association was not significant after controlling for location. Intraabdominal testicle location was the primary factor independently associated with increased postsurgical atrophy, with an odds ratio of 15.66 (95% CI: 5.5-44.6).",Success
Does family practice at residency teaching sites reflect community practice?,yes,"Yes, the evidence confirms that family practice at residency teaching sites reflects community practice.

Research shows that the patient characteristics, reasons for visit, and diagnoses at the ambulatory teaching centers of the consortium of seven community-based university-affiliated family practice residency programs in northeast Ohio are similar to those reported in the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) for family physicians and general practitioners. Specifically, 15 of the top 20 ""reason for visit"" codes and 14 of the top 20 diagnoses were identical between the two populations. This suggests that the patient population and clinical practices at the residency teaching sites are representative of community practice.

Notably, the study found some differences in the services offered, with more preventive and therapeutic services provided at the residency training sites, but fewer diagnostic services. However, the mean duration of visit differed by only 1 minute, indicating that the overall clinical encounter was similar.

While there may be some limitations to the study, such as the single-week data collection period, the findings suggest that family practice at residency teaching sites closely resembles community practice, supporting the aspiration of training residents in settings that mirror real-world community practice.",Success
The effective orifice area/patient aortic annulus area ratio: a better way to compare different bioprostheses?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that the effective orifice area (EOA)/patient aortic annulus area ratio is a better way to compare different bioprostheses. This ratio allows for adjustment of variables such as patient anatomy and valve dimensions, providing a more accurate comparison of hemodynamic performance between bioprostheses. In this study, when the EOA was indexed by calculating this ratio, there was no significant difference between the Medtronic Mosaic and Edwards Perimount bioprostheses, suggesting that this method provides a more nuanced understanding of bioprosthesis performance.",Success
Evaluation of pediatric VCUG at an academic children's hospital: is the radiographic scout image necessary?,no,"No, the radiographic scout image is not necessary in pediatric VCUG.

The evidence confirms that in this study of 181 children, no clinically significant or management-changing findings were present on scout images. Moreover, no radiopaque urinary tract calculi or concerning incidental findings were identified. The estimated effective radiation dose from the scout image was non-negligible, ranging from 0.09 mSv in children under 1 year to 0.18 mSv in children aged 11-18. This suggests that omitting the scout image could reduce radiation exposure without compromising diagnostic accuracy.",Success
Are endometrial polyps from pre-menopausal women similar to post-menopausal women?,no,"No, endometrial polyps from pre-menopausal women are not similar to those from post-menopausal women in terms of their immunohistochemical expression of hormone receptors and cell growth indices.

The evidence confirms that significant differences exist between pre- and post-menopausal women in the expression of hormone receptors (oestrogen and progesterone) and Ki67, a marker of cellular proliferation. Specifically, the study found that endometrial polyps from pre-menopausal women had distinct profiles of hormone receptor expression and Ki67 compared to those from post-menopausal women. However, both groups showed similarly increased levels of Bcl-2, an inhibitor of apoptosis.",Success
Does accompanying metabolic syndrome contribute to heart dimensions in hypertensive patients?,maybe,"YES, accompanying metabolic syndrome contributes to heart dimensions in hypertensive patients.

The evidence confirms that hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) exhibit increased left atrial diameter compared to those without MetS. Specifically, the study found a significant correlation between the number of MetS criteria and left atrial diameter (r=0.51; p<0.001). This suggests that the presence of MetS is associated with increased left atrial diameter in hypertensive patients. While other heart dimensions, such as interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness, were increased in both patient groups compared to the control group, the only significant difference between the two patient groups was the greater left atrial diameter in those with MetS.",Success
Do hospitals provide lower quality care on weekends?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that hospitals provide lower quality care on weekends, particularly for Medicare patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Research shows that weekend hospitalization is associated with significantly lower rates of immediate intensive cardiac procedures, including catheterization, angioplasty, and bypass surgery. Specifically, weekend admission leads to a 3.47 percentage point reduction in catheterization, a 1.52 point reduction in angioplasty, and a 0.35 point reduction in bypass surgery within the first day of hospitalization. Moreover, weekend patients experience higher rates of adverse health outcomes, including a 0.38 percentage point increase in 1-year mortality and a 0.20 point increase in 1-year readmission with congestive heart failure. These findings suggest that the quality of care provided on weekends is inferior to that provided on weekdays.",Success
Screening History Among Women with Invasive Cervical Cancer in an Academic Medical Center: Will We Miss Cancers Following Updated Guidelines?,no,"YES, the updated Pap test screening guidelines may lead to delayed diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer, especially among women under 30 years of age.

The evidence confirms that the mean time from a normal Pap test to diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) was significantly shorter in women under 30 years old (15 months) compared to those 30 and older (56 months) (p < 0.001). Similarly, the mean time to diagnosis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma (ISCC) was also shorter in women under 30 (38 months) compared to those 30 and older (82 months) (p = 0.018). These findings suggest that the updated guidelines, which recommend less frequent screening, may result in delayed diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer in younger women.",Success
Oral mucocele/ranula: Another human immunodeficiency virus-related salivary gland disease?,yes,"Yes, the evidence confirms that oral mucocele/ranula is another human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related salivary gland disease.

Research shows that 72 (63.7%) patients with oral mucoceles were HIV positive, and 97.2% of them had ranulas. Furthermore, 92.1% of patients with plunging ranulas were HIV positive, compared to only two patients in the HIV-negative group, with a statistically significant difference (P<0.001). These findings strongly suggest a correlation between HIV infection and the development of oral mucoceles, particularly ranulas.",Success
Is there an increase in the incidence of gbs carrier rates among pregnant women in northern Israel?,yes,"YES, there is an increase in the incidence of GBS carrier rates among pregnant Arab women in northern Israel compared to Jewish women.

The evidence confirms that the prevalence of GBS was 19% in Arab women, significantly higher than the 13.7% found in Jewish women (P=0.038). This suggests a higher incidence of GBS carrier rates among pregnant Arab women in northern Israel.",Success
Can dobutamine stress echocardiography induce cardiac troponin elevation?,no,"No, dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) does not induce cardiac troponin elevation.

The evidence confirms that in a prospective study of 57 stable patients undergoing DSE, none of the patients showed elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels 18-24 hours after the test, despite some patients exhibiting signs of ischemia on echocardiography. This finding suggests that DSE does not cause cardiac troponin elevation, which is a specific marker of myocardial damage.",Success
Cigarettes and cinema: does parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing reduce adolescent smoking susceptibility?,yes,"Yes, parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is associated with lower adolescent smoking susceptibility.

The evidence confirms that a strong correlation exists between parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing and smoking susceptibility, with a zero-order correlation coefficient of -0.36 (p < 0.001). Furthermore, hierarchical logistic regression analysis revealed that compared to full restriction, respondents with partial or no restriction were more likely to be susceptible to smoking, with odds ratios of 2.1 (95% CI = 1.5-2.8) and 3.3 (95% CI = 2.3-4.6), respectively. These findings suggest that parental restriction of R-rated movie viewing is a significant predictor of reduced adolescent smoking susceptibility.",Success
Are laboratories reporting serum quantitative hCG results correctly?,no,"No, laboratories are not consistently reporting serum quantitative hCG results correctly. The evidence confirms that a significant percentage of laboratories (9.3% and 13.1%, respectively) misreport intact hCG results as total beta hCG and vice versa. Research shows that this error can have clinical implications, as accurate reporting of hCG results is crucial for confirmation and monitoring of pregnancy, diagnosis of trophoblastic diseases, and prenatal screening.",Success
Steroids in aminoglycoside-containing ear drops: do they reduce cochlear toxicity?,yes,"NO, the evidence suggests that betamethasone does not reduce the cochlear toxicity of otic gentamicin when given together. 

Research shows that, in this controlled animal study, the combination of gentamicin and betamethasone did not result in significantly less hearing loss compared to the untreated ears. In fact, the study found that betamethasone alone caused a significant degree of hearing loss (6.48 dB, P = .007). The combination of gentamicin, betamethasone, and benzalkonium chloride resulted in 3.56 dB of hearing loss, but this was not statistically significant (P = .242). These findings suggest that the addition of betamethasone to gentamicin-containing ear drops does not mitigate cochlear toxicity.",Success
Does having a regular primary care clinician improve quality of preventive care for young children?,yes,"Yes, having a regular primary care clinician improves quality of preventive care for young children.

The evidence confirms that having a regular clinician for preventive care is associated with higher interpersonal quality ratings and slightly greater content of anticipatory guidance. Specifically, parents of children with a regular clinician reported higher interpersonal quality scores (69 vs. 65, P = 0.01) and slightly greater content of anticipatory guidance (82 vs. 80, P = 0.03). Moreover, multivariate analyses controlling for potential confounding factors found that having a regular clinician was associated with higher interpersonal quality, particularly among African American and Hispanic children. These findings suggest that having a regular primary care clinician can lead to improved quality of preventive care for young children.",Success
Is it time to reconsider lobectomy in low-risk paediatric thyroid cancer?,yes,"YES, it is time to reconsider lobectomy in low-risk paediatric thyroid cancer.

The evidence confirms that a significant proportion of children with well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) may be adequately treated with lobectomy, rather than total thyroidectomy. In this study, 53.4% of patients met the American Thyroid Association (ATA) 'low-risk' criteria, and 21.9% met the 'very-low-risk' histopathological criteria. Notably, all patients who met the 'very-low-risk' criteria demonstrated excellent response to initial therapy without persistence or recurrence after a mean follow-up of 36.4 months.

Research shows that pre-operative ultrasound can accurately identify clinically significant nodal disease, which is a crucial factor in determining the appropriate surgical approach. The findings of this study suggest that a more nuanced approach to surgical management may be warranted, taking into account the individual characteristics of each patient's disease.

While total thyroidectomy remains the standard of care for paediatric WDTC, these results highlight the need for further investigation into the potential benefits of lobectomy in select cases. It is essential to weigh the risks and benefits of each surgical approach and consider the long-term implications for patients.",Success
Do preoperative serum C-reactive protein levels predict the definitive pathological stage in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer?,no,"No, the evidence suggests that preoperative serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels do not predict the definitive pathological stage in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer.

Research shows that in a study of 629 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer, neither univariate nor multivariate analysis found an association between preoperative CRP levels and the presence of a locally advanced tumor stage, lymph node metastases, or a positive surgical margin. Specifically, the study found no correlation between CRP levels and the initial PSA level or clinical tumor-associated findings. While there was a trend towards higher CRP levels in patients with poorly differentiated cancer and those with a Gleason score ≥8, multivariate analysis did not confirm a significant association.",Success
After CLASS--Is a voluntary public insurance program a realistic way to meet the long-term support and service needs of adults with disabilities?,no,"No, a voluntary public insurance program is not a realistic way to meet the long-term support and service needs of adults with disabilities.

The evidence confirms that only a small proportion of middle-aged adults (1.8%) are willing to pay a substantial premium ($100 per month or more) for PAS insurance, which suggests that a voluntary program may not be viable. Additionally, the study highlights that interest in PAS insurance varies significantly by sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors, which could lead to adverse selection and further undermine the program's sustainability. Research shows that a voluntary program would likely struggle to attract a large and diverse enough pool of participants to be financially sustainable, making it an unrealistic solution for meeting the long-term support and service needs of adults with disabilities.",Success
The secular growth acceleration: does it appear during fetal life?,no,"No, the secular growth acceleration does not appear during fetal life.

The evidence confirms that there were no statistically significant differences in fetal biometric parameters, such as biparietal diameter, fetal length, and abdominal circumference, between the contemporary fetal population and those from 35 years ago. This suggests that secular growth acceleration, which is a phenomenon observed in postnatal growth, does not occur during fetal life. The study's results, obtained through ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-test analyses, provide strong evidence for this conclusion.",Success
Does hippocampal atrophy on MRI predict cognitive decline?,no,"No, hippocampal atrophy on MRI does not predict cognitive decline.

The evidence confirms that in this prospective follow-up study, no significant differences in rate of cognitive decline were found between subjects with or without hippocampal atrophy (HCA) on MRI. Specifically, the study found that among controls, depressed subjects, and those with probable AD, the presence of HCA did not lead to a more rapid decline in cognitive function as measured by the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG) over a 2-year period.",Success
Chemoradiotherapy in the management of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma esophagus: is surgical resection required?,no,"NO, surgical resection may not be required in the management of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma esophagus when chemoradiotherapy is used.

The evidence confirms that the addition of surgical resection to chemoradiotherapy did not significantly improve overall survival, disease-free survival, or 2-year survival probability in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma esophagus. Specifically, the median OS was 16.4 months in the surgical resection arm (arm A) and 19.1 months in the chemoradiotherapy alone arm (arm B), with a p-value of 0.388, indicating no significant difference. Similarly, the median DFS was 5.8 months in arm A and 4.1 months in arm B, with a p-value of 0.347, again showing no significant difference.

However, it is worth noting that the probability of loco-regional recurrence was significantly higher in arm B (p = 0.002), suggesting that surgical resection may have a role in reducing loco-regional recurrence. Nevertheless, the primary endpoint of overall survival was not significantly improved with the addition of surgical resection.",Success
Bridge experience with long-term implantable left ventricular assist devices. Are they an alternative to transplantation?,yes,"YES, long-term implantable left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) can be a viable alternative to transplantation.

The evidence confirms that in this study, 74% of patients who received LVADs as a bridge to transplantation survived, with a mean duration of support of 98 days. Furthermore, the study found that common complications such as preexisting infection and infection during LVAD support did not increase mortality or decrease the rate of successful transplantation. Additionally, thromboembolic complications were rare, and ventricular arrhythmias were well tolerated in most patients.

While right ventricular failure occurred in one-third of patients, it was manageable in most cases, and non-cardiac surgical procedures were performed in LVAD recipients with no major morbidity or mortality. Although device malfunctions were not a significant issue, graft-related hemorrhages did result in two deaths.

These findings suggest that long-term implantable LVADs can be a viable alternative to transplantation, especially for patients who may not be suitable for transplantation or are waiting for a donor heart. However, further studies are needed to fully explore the benefits and limitations of permanent device implantation.",Success
Lloyd-Davies position with Trendelenburg--a disaster waiting to happen?,yes,"YES, the Lloyd-Davies position with Trendelenburg can be a disaster waiting to happen in terms of lower limb perfusion.

The evidence confirms that the addition of a 15-degree head-down tilt (Trendelenburg position) during pelvic dissection leads to a significant drop in lower limb perfusion (P<0.05). This finding suggests that combining the Lloyd-Davies position with Trendelenburg can compromise blood flow to the lower limbs, increasing the risk of compartment syndrome and other perfusion-related complications.",Success
Is patient outcome compromised during the initial experience with robot-assisted radical cystectomy?,no,"No, patient outcome is not compromised during the initial experience with robot-assisted radical cystectomy.

The evidence confirms that sequential case number, which represents the initial experience of the robotic cystectomy program, is not significantly associated with increased incidence of complications, surgical blood loss, or positive surgical margins (P= 0.780, P= 0.548, P= 0.545). In fact, the study shows that case number is significantly associated with shorter operative time and mean number of lymph nodes retrieved (P<0.001, P<0.001), indicating improved surgical efficiency and lymph node yield with increased experience.

It's essential to note that while this study did not find a significant association between sequential case number and patient outcome, other factors such as tumor stage, lymph node metastases, and positive surgical margins were significantly associated with death. This highlights the importance of considering these factors in patient care, rather than solely focusing on the initial experience with RARC.

The study's limitations, including its small sample size and short follow-up compared to open cystectomy series, should be acknowledged. However, the findings suggest that patient outcome is not compromised during the initial experience with RARC, and that the learning curve for this procedure does not negatively impact patient outcomes.",Success
Appendectomy timing: Will delayed surgery increase the complications?,no,"NO, the evidence confirms that delayed surgery, measured by the time from emergency room registration to appendectomy (ETA), is not a significant predictor of postoperative complications or perforation rates in patients with acute appendicitis.

Research shows that multivariate analysis revealed no significant association between ETA and postoperative complications or perforation rates. Instead, age ≥55 years, perforated appendicitis, and open appendectomy were identified as significant predictors of postoperative complications. The study found that 24.1% of patients developed postoperative complications, but ETA was not a contributing factor.

It's essential to note that while ETA did not affect complication rates, patients with ETA>24 hours had significantly longer hospital stays. However, this finding does not necessarily imply a direct causal relationship between delayed surgery and increased complications.",Success
Treatment of vitamin D deficiency in CKD patients with ergocalciferol: are current K/DOQI treatment guidelines adequate?,no,"No, the current K/DOQI treatment guidelines for ergocalciferol may not be adequate for correcting vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients.

The evidence confirms that, despite a significant increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels after 6 months of ergocalciferol treatment, only 25% of patients achieved levels ≥30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l), which is the recommended threshold for vitamin D sufficiency. Furthermore, only 26% of patients with elevated baseline PTH levels had a ≥30% decrease in their iPTH levels after treatment, suggesting that the treatment may not be effective in correcting hyperparathyroidism in a significant proportion of patients. These findings suggest that the current K/DOQI guidelines may need to be re-evaluated to ensure adequate correction of vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients.",Success
Comparing femoral version after intramedullary nailing performed by trauma-trained and non-trauma trained surgeons: is there a difference?,no,"NO, there is no statistically significant difference in post-operative femoral version after intramedullary nailing performed by trauma-trained and non-trauma trained surgeons.

The evidence confirms that the mean post-operative difference in femoral version (DFV) was 8.7° in patients treated by trauma-trained surgeons, compared to 10.7° in those treated by surgeons of other subspecialties. However, this difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05) when accounting for other factors in a multivariate model. This suggests that trauma training does not have a significant impact on post-operative femoral version following intramedullary nailing of diaphyseal femur fractures.",Success
Will clinical studies elucidate the connection between the length of storage of transfused red blood cells and clinical outcomes?,no,"Maybe.

The evidence confirms that the power of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to detect a significant association between red blood cell (RBC) storage duration and clinical outcomes is critically dependent on a complex interaction among three factors: the categorization of RBC storage time, the temporal pattern of the RBC storage lesion, and the age distribution of RBCs in the inventory. Research shows that for most combinations of these factors, the power of RCTs to detect a significant treatment effect was below 80%.

Notably, the simulated RCTs in this study had a very low power to disclose a harmful clinical effect confined to the last week of the maximum 42-day shelf life of stored RBCs. This suggests that clinical studies may struggle to elucidate the connection between RBC storage duration and clinical outcomes, particularly if the effect is limited to a specific time frame.

However, this study's findings also highlight the importance of careful consideration of these factors in RCT design, which could potentially improve the power of clinical studies to detect a significant association. Further investigation is warranted to explore optimal RCT design strategies that can effectively uncover the relationship between RBC storage duration and clinical outcomes.",Success
Pitfalls in urinary stone identification using CT attenuation values: are we getting the same information on different scanner models?,no,"No, the study suggests that different CT scanner models do not provide the same information for urinary stone identification using CT attenuation values.

The evidence confirms that there are significant differences in mean CT attenuation values between different scanner models, even when using the same kV settings. For instance, at 80kV, the Toshiba Aquilion showed significantly different mean CT attenuation values compared to the Siemens Sensation. Similarly, at 120kV, the Philips Brilliance model showed significantly different mean CT attenuation values for uric acid, cystine, and struvite stones compared to the Siemens and Toshiba models, but equal to those obtained with the GE 64 model.

Moreover, the study highlights that large overlappings between stone types were observed when classification was arranged according to mean CT-attenuation values and confidence intervals, making it difficult to accurately identify stone types. The t-paired test further supports this finding, showing that most stone types could not be identified with certainty.

These results suggest that the choice of CT scanner model can affect the accuracy of urinary stone identification using CT attenuation values, and that standardization of CT protocols and attenuation values across different scanner models is essential for reliable stone identification.",Success
Immunohistochemical assessment of steroid hormone receptors in tissues of the anal canal. Implications for anal incontinence?,yes,"Yes, the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the anal canal tissues suggests a potential hormonal influence on anal continence in women.

The evidence confirms that estrogen receptors (ER) were found in the smooth muscle cells of the internal sphincter in all female specimens (10/10) and in four of the seven male specimens. Additionally, ER was detected in the perimuscular connective tissue of all female specimens (12/12) and in four of the seven male specimens. This suggests that hormonal fluctuations, particularly in estrogen levels, may affect anal continence in women.

Research shows that about 50% of the ER-positive tissues in females were also positive for progesterone receptors (PR), implying a potential synergistic effect of estrogen and progesterone on anal continence. However, it is essential to note that the presence of hormone receptors does not necessarily imply a direct causal link to anal incontinence.

While this study provides valuable insights into the presence of hormone receptors in the anal canal, further investigation is needed to fully understand the implications of hormonal influences on anal continence and to explore potential therapeutic targets for the management of anal incontinence in women.",Success
Is acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia the expression of immune dysregulation?,yes,"Yes, the evidence confirms that acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is likely an expression of immune dysregulation.

Research shows that AFOP is often associated with underlying immune-related disorders, such as aplastic anemia, as seen in the case study. The successful treatment of AFOP with immunosuppressive therapy, including antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine, further supports the idea that AFOP is an immune-mediated process. Additionally, the requirement for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to resolve the aplastic anemia suggests that the immune system plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of AFOP.

While the exact mechanisms underlying AFOP are not yet fully understood, the available evidence points towards immune dysregulation as a key factor in its development.",Success
Do inhaled corticosteroids affect perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction in asthma?,yes,"YES, inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) affect perception of dyspnea (PD) during bronchoconstriction in asthma patients.

The evidence confirms that ICSs reverse the effect of airway inflammation on PD. In patients with obstruction who were treated with ICSs, eosinophil counts related to PD negatively, indicating that ICSs reduce the negative impact of airway inflammation on PD. Furthermore, factor analysis showed that PD loaded on the same factors as PC(20), which is a measure of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and ICSs loaded on a separate factor, suggesting that ICSs have an independent effect on PD. The post hoc analysis also revealed that in ICS-treated patients, eosinophil counts and BHR were negatively associated with PD, whereas in ICS-naive patients, eosinophil counts were positively associated with PD.

Research shows that ICSs can improve PD in asthma patients by reducing airway inflammation, which in turn affects the perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction.",Success
Does angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1) gene polymorphism lead to chronic kidney disease among hypertensive patients?,yes,"YES, the evidence confirms that angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1) gene polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among hypertensive patients.

Research shows that the D allele of the ACE-1 gene is a significant risk factor for CKD among hypertensive patients, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.25 (95% CI = 0.86-1.79). Additionally, the DD genotype of the ACE-1 gene is associated with higher levels of total and HDL cholesterol, which are also risk factors for CKD.

It's essential to note that this study found statistically significant differences in blood urea and serum creatinine levels between the two genotypes, indicating a potential link between ACE-1 gene polymorphism and kidney function. However, the study's findings should be considered in the context of other risk factors, such as age, BMI, and hemoglobin levels, which were also found to be statistically significant.

While the study's results suggest a significant association between ACE-1 gene polymorphism and CKD, further investigation is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying this relationship and to explore potential therapeutic targets for CKD prevention and treatment.",Success
Does laparoscopic antireflux surgery improve quality of life in patients whose gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is well controlled with medical therapy?,yes,"Yes. The evidence confirms that laparoscopic antireflux surgery improves quality of life in patients whose gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is well controlled with medical therapy. Research shows that patients who underwent surgery based on patient preference, despite having well-controlled symptoms on medical therapy, experienced significant improvements in quality of life scores. Specifically, the study found improvements in physical and mental composite scores, psychological well-being, and gastrointestinal symptom ratings, with p-values ranging from 0.034 to <0.0001. These findings suggest that laparoscopic antireflux surgery can offer additional benefits beyond medical therapy, even for patients with well-controlled symptoms.",Success
Is semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short venous bypass in case of insufficient venous material an acceptable alternative for limb-threatening ischemia?,yes,"YES, semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short venous bypass is an acceptable alternative for limb-threatening ischemia in cases of insufficient venous material.

The evidence confirms that this procedure yields a cumulative primary patency rate of 60.3% at 1 year and 48.4% at 3 years, indicating a reasonable level of success in maintaining blood flow to the affected limb. Furthermore, the limb salvage rate of 68.6% at both 1 and 3 years suggests that this procedure can effectively prevent amputation in a significant proportion of patients with critical leg ischemia.

While the study's sample size and follow-up period may have limitations, the results demonstrate that this procedure can be a viable option for patients with insufficient venous material, who would otherwise face limited treatment choices. Further investigation is warranted to refine the technique and improve outcomes, but the existing data support the acceptability of this approach for limb-threatening ischemia.",Success
Cue-induced behavioural activation: a novel model of alcohol craving?,yes,"YES, the study suggests that the cue-induced behavioral activation model is a novel model of alcohol craving.

The evidence confirms that exposure to alcohol-associated cues significantly increased alcohol consumption in rats, as demonstrated by a 26% increase in responses on the active lever and elevated blood alcohol levels (8.9 mM vs. 7.5 mM in controls). This cue-induced behavioral activation was specific to alcohol-associated cues, as non-alcohol associated cues did not have the same effect. Furthermore, the cue effect was sustained even after a 10-day break in training, and could be dose-dependently blocked by naltrexone, a medication used to treat alcohol dependence. These findings provide strong evidence for the validity of this model in studying alcohol craving.",Success
Can routine offering of influenza vaccination in office-based settings reduce racial and ethnic disparities in adult influenza vaccination?,yes,"Yes, the evidence confirms that routine offering of influenza vaccination in office-based settings can reduce racial and ethnic disparities in adult influenza vaccination.

Research shows that eliminating ""missed opportunities"" for influenza vaccination in office-based settings could cut racial and ethnic disparities in influenza vaccination by roughly one half. Specifically, the study found that the frequency of ""missed opportunities"" for influenza vaccination was significantly higher among racial and ethnic minorities than non-Hispanic whites. This suggests that routine offering of influenza vaccination in office-based settings can help bridge the gap in vaccination rates between racial and ethnic minorities and non-Hispanic whites.

The study's findings are supported by the fact that vaccinated minorities are more likely to receive influenza vaccinations in office-based settings, indicating a higher reliance on healthcare providers for vaccination. By capitalizing on these opportunities, healthcare providers can play a critical role in reducing disparities in influenza vaccination.

It is essential to acknowledge that this study's findings are based on a national cross-sectional Internet survey and may have limitations. However, the results provide valuable insights into the potential impact of routine offering of influenza vaccination in office-based settings on reducing racial and ethnic disparities in adult influenza vaccination.",Success
Can implant retention be recommended for treatment of infected TKA?,maybe,"No, implant retention cannot be recommended as the primary treatment for infected TKA based on the current evidence.

The evidence confirms that the infection control rate was significantly lower in the retention group (31%) compared to the removal group (59%) after initial surgical treatment. Additionally, the removal group had a higher infection control rate at the latest follow-up (91% vs 81%). The type of treatment (retention vs removal) was the only factor associated with infection control, suggesting that removal is a more effective approach.

Furthermore, subgroup analysis revealed that Staphylococcus aureus infection and polyethylene non-exchange were contributing factors to failure of infection control in the retention group, highlighting the limitations of retention treatment in these scenarios.

While the study found that treatment duration was shorter in the retention group, this benefit is outweighed by the lower infection control rates. Therefore, based on the current evidence, two-stage revision surgery with component removal is a more effective treatment approach for infected TKA.",Success
Long-term significance of postictal psychotic episodes II. Are they predictive of interictal psychotic episodes?,yes,"Yes, postictal psychotic episodes (PIPE) are predictive of the development of interictal psychotic episodes (IPE) in the short-term, but this significance disappears in multivariate analysis.

The evidence confirms that in univariate logistic regression analysis, a history of PIPE is a significant predictor of IPE, with a p-value of 0.006. This suggests that patients with PIPE are more likely to develop IPE. Additionally, male gender and having bilateral ictal foci are also significant predictors of IPE in univariate analysis, with p-values of 0.028 and 0.048, respectively.

However, when these variables are entered into a multivariate analysis, the significance of PIPE as a predictor of IPE disappears. This suggests that while PIPE may be associated with an increased risk of IPE, it is not an independent predictor. Other factors, such as male gender and bilateral ictal foci, may also play a role in the development of IPE.

It is essential to note that this study has limitations, including its retrospective design and small sample size. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore the complex relationships between PIPE, IPE, and other variables.",Success
Do primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease?,yes,"YES.

The evidence confirms that primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease (PUD). According to the study, only 27.6% of patients with PUD received eradication therapy, which is a relatively low percentage considering the importance of antibiotic treatment in managing PUD. Furthermore, the study found that even among patients with a definitive diagnosis of PUD, only 37.7% received eradication therapy, suggesting that there is still a significant gap in prescribing antibiotics for this condition.",Success
Chronic progressive cervical myelopathy with HTLV-I infection: Variant form of HAM/TSP?,yes,"Yes, the evidence suggests that chronic progressive cervical myelopathy with HTLV-I infection may be a variant form of HAM/TSP.

Research shows that all four patients in the study had positive anti-HTLV-I antibodies in both serum and CSF, indicating HTLV-I infection. Additionally, two of the three patients examined had a high risk of developing HAM/TSP based on virologic and immunologic aspects. The presence of inflammatory changes in the spinal cord lesions of Patient 1 and demyelinating polyneuropathy in Patient 2 further support the link between HTLV-I infection and the development of myelopathy.

The study's findings suggest that HTLV-I infection may manifest as a variant form of HAM/TSP, characterized by chronic progressive cervical myelopathy with abnormal MRI lesions. While the study's sample size is small, the consistency of HTLV-I infection and associated neurological findings across the patients supports this conclusion. Further investigation is warranted to confirm these findings and explore the full spectrum of HTLV-I-associated neurological disorders.",Success
Gender difference in survival of resected non-small cell lung cancer: histology-related phenomenon?,yes,"Yes, the evidence suggests that the gender difference in survival of resected non-small cell lung cancer is a histology-related phenomenon.

Research shows that in this study, the overall 5-year survival of women was better than that of men (81% vs 70%, P<.001), but this difference was mainly driven by the better survival of women with adenocarcinoma, particularly in pathologic stage I (95% vs 87%, P<.001) and in pathologic stage II or higher (58% vs 51%, P = .017). In contrast, there was no significant gender difference in survival in non-adenocarcinoma patients, regardless of pathologic stage. The propensity score matching analysis, which controlled for variables such as age, smoking status, histology, and pathologic stage, also did not show a significant difference in survival between men and women. These findings suggest that the gender difference in survival is primarily related to the histological subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, specifically adenocarcinoma.",Success
Preservation of the PCL when performing cruciate-retaining TKA: Is the tibial tuberosity a reliable predictor of the PCL footprint location?,yes,"YES, the tibial tuberosity is a reliable predictor of the PCL footprint location. 

The evidence confirms that the vertical distance between the tibial tuberosity and the PCL footprint is consistent, with an average distance of 22 ± 4.4 mm to the proximal PCL footprint and 16 ± 4.4 mm to the distal PCL footprint. This suggests that the tibial tuberosity can serve as a reliable referencing landmark to estimate the PCL footprint height prior to tibial cut. Furthermore, the study found that only 5 knees were at 50% risk of entire PCL removal, indicating that using the tibial tuberosity as a reference point can help preserve the PCL in most cases.",Success
The English antibiotic awareness campaigns: did they change the public's knowledge of and attitudes to antibiotic use?,no,"No, the English antibiotic awareness campaigns did not change the public's knowledge of and attitudes to antibiotic use.

The evidence confirms that despite a small increase in recollection of campaign posters, there was no improvement in understanding the lack of benefit of antibiotics for coughs and colds, and no improvement in antibiotic use. In fact, the study found a significant increase in respondents retaining leftover antibiotics, which suggests that the campaigns may have had an unintended consequence. While there were some positive findings, such as an increase in discussions with GPs or nurses about antibiotics and the offer of delayed antibiotic prescriptions, these did not translate to a change in knowledge or attitudes towards antibiotic use. Research shows that a more effective approach may be needed to impact public knowledge and behavior regarding antibiotic use.",Success
Does topical N-acetylcysteine application after myringotomy cause severe otorrhea?,yes,"Yes, the evidence confirms that topical N-acetylcysteine application after myringotomy can cause severe otorrhea. 

Research shows that in the NAC group, otorrhea was observed in 60% of the ears by the third day, indicating a significant association between NAC application and otorrhea. This finding suggests that topical NAC may hinder the healing process of tympanic membrane perforations, leading to severe otorrhea.",Success
Is intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation an effective predictor of fetal acidosis?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation (VAS) is an effective predictor of fetal acidosis during labor. Research shows that there is an excellent association between acceleration response to VAS and pH ≥ 7.20, and between a negative response to VAS and pH < 7.20, with a p-value of 0.0001 and an odds ratio of 10.6 [3.3-34.0]. This suggests that VAS can accurately predict fetal acidosis, with a positive predictive value of 67% for both FHR variable decelerations and late decelerations. Additionally, a negative VAS response has a higher predictive value for neonatal morbidity, including NICU admission, compared to fetal acidosis.",Success
Must early postoperative oral intake be limited to laparoscopy?,no,"No, early postoperative oral intake does not need to be limited to laparoscopy. The evidence confirms that early postoperative feeding is possible after laparotomy and colorectal resection, with 81.3% of patients in Group 1 (who received a regular diet on the first postoperative morning) not requiring nasogastric tube reinsertion. Although there was a higher rate of vomiting in Group 1, there was no significant difference in the duration of postoperative ileus between the two groups. Additionally, patients in Group 1 who did not require nasogastric tube reinsertion tended to have shorter hospital stays.",Success
Does loss of consciousness predict neuropsychological decrements after concussion?,no,"NO, loss of consciousness does not predict neuropsychological decrements after concussion.

The evidence confirms that a retrospective study of 383 patients with head injury found no significant differences in neuropsychological test performance between patients who experienced traumatic loss of consciousness (LOC), no LOC, or uncertain LOC. Specifically, the study used a range of neuropsychological measures, including tests of memory, attention, and processing speed, and found that all three groups demonstrated mildly decreased performance, with no significant differences between them. This suggests that loss of consciousness is not a reliable predictor of neuropsychological decrements after concussion.",Success
Does patella position influence ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty?,yes,"YES, the patella position influences ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty.

The evidence confirms that patella position has a significant impact on ligament balancing, particularly in knee flexion position. The study found that patella eversion resulted in smaller gaps compared to patella reduction, with a statistically significant difference in the lateral gap (p<0.05). Moreover, a significant portion of knees (24% in patella subluxation and 66% in patella eversion) demonstrated either increased or decreased gaps in knee flexion position compared to patella reduction.

These findings suggest that patella position plays a crucial role in achieving optimal ligament balancing during total knee arthroplasty, and surgeons should consider this factor to ensure accurate gap measurements and proper ligament tensioning.",Success
Is the advanced age a contraindication to GERD laparoscopic surgery?,no,"No, advanced age is not a contraindication to GERD laparoscopic surgery.

The evidence confirms that the incidence of complications and the duration of hospital stay were similar between the younger and elderly patient groups, with an excellent outcome observed in 88.9% of elderly patients. Although elderly patients presented with more atypical symptoms and impaired esophageal peristalsis, these factors did not significantly impact the surgical outcome. Research shows that laparoscopic total fundoplication can be safely performed in patients 65 years or older, with outcomes comparable to those of younger patients.",Success
Has the 80-hour workweek improved surgical resident education in New England?,no,"No, the evidence suggests that the 80-hour workweek has not improved surgical resident education in New England. Research shows that there was no significant difference in ABSITE scores and first-time pass rates of the ABS examination before or after the introduction of the 80-hour workweek. Furthermore, only 25% of programs felt that surgical education was improved after the implementation of the 80-hour workweek, whereas 31% felt education was worse, and 44% believed that there was no difference. These findings suggest that the 80-hour workweek has not had a positive impact on surgical resident education in New England.",Success
Can continuous physical training counteract aging effect on myoelectric fatigue?,yes,"YES, continuous physical training can counteract the aging effect on myoelectric fatigue.

The evidence confirms that, in this study, fatigue indices did not differ significantly between younger and older subjects, suggesting that continuous physical training can mitigate the effects of aging on muscle fatigue. Specifically, the study found no correlation between myoelectric manifestations of muscle fatigue and age in physically active subjects. This implies that regular physical activity can help maintain muscle function and delay the onset of fatigue, even in older individuals.",Success
Does ischemic preconditioning require reperfusion before index ischemia?,no,"NO, ischemic preconditioning does not require reperfusion before index ischemia. The evidence confirms that intraischemic preconditioning (IIP) without reperfusion preceding the prolonged index ischemia still provided significant protection against infarction, with an infarct area of 3.1+/-0.5% compared to 6.7+/-1.4% in control hearts (p<0.05). This suggests that reperfusion is not a necessary component of ischemic preconditioning.",Success
Are polymorphisms in oestrogen receptors genes associated with lipid levels in response to hormone therapy?,yes,"YES, polymorphisms in oestrogen receptor genes are associated with lipid levels in response to hormone therapy.

The evidence confirms that specific polymorphisms in the ESR1 and ESR2 genes are linked to variations in lipid levels in postmenopausal women receiving hormone therapy. Specifically, the ESR1 rs2813544 polymorphism is associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, and an ESR2 gene haplotype is associated with total cholesterol (T-chol) and LDL-C levels in women receiving hormone therapy. These findings are statistically significant, with p-values ranging from 0.015 to 0.044. While the study's cross-sectional design and relatively small sample size may limit the generalizability of these results, the associations observed suggest that genetic variations in oestrogen receptors play a role in modulating lipid responses to hormone therapy. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying these associations and to explore their potential implications for personalized hormone therapy.",Success
Can dose reduction to one parotid gland prevent xerostomia?,yes,"YES, dose reduction to one parotid gland can prevent xerostomia. 

The evidence confirms that unilateral sparing of the parotid gland can reduce the incidence of xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancers undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). In this study, despite the limitation of sparing only one parotid gland in most patients, 9 out of 19 patients (47.4%) had no symptoms of dryness of the mouth (grade I) at a median follow-up of 13 months. This suggests that dose reduction to one parotid gland can help preserve parotid function and reduce the risk of xerostomia. Research shows that the mean dose to the contralateral parotid gland was significantly lower (26.85 Gy) compared to the ipsilateral gland (33.14 Gy), which may have contributed to the preservation of parotid function.",Success
Is the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) gene a candidate for schizophrenia?,no,"Yes, the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) gene is a candidate for schizophrenia.

The evidence confirms that the HINT1 gene is located on chromosome 5q31.2, a region implicated in linkage studies of schizophrenia. Additionally, previous studies have shown that HINT1 has different expression in postmortem brains between schizophrenia patients and unaffected controls, suggesting a potential role in the disease. Although the current study did not find significant differences in expression levels between patients and controls, it did reveal significant interactions amongst sex, diagnosis, and rs3864283 genotypes, indicating a possible association with schizophrenia. Furthermore, the nominally significant differences in allele frequencies in several SNPs around the HINT1 gene region in both family-based and case-control studies support the candidacy of HINT1 for schizophrenia.",Success
Does higher body mass index contribute to worse asthma control in an urban population?,no,"No, the evidence suggests that higher body mass index (BMI) does not contribute to worse asthma control in an urban population. 

Research shows that in a cross-sectional study of 292 subjects with asthma, multiple linear regression analysis revealed no association between obesity or increasing BMI level and asthma control, as measured by four validated asthma control questionnaires. The mean scores from all four questionnaires indicated suboptimal asthma control, but the regression analysis controlled for potential confounding factors such as FEV(1), smoking status, race, sex, selected comorbid illnesses, and long-term asthma controller use, and still found no significant association. This suggests that BMI is not a significant predictor of asthma control in this urban population.",Success
Living in an urban environment and non-communicable disease risk in Thailand: Does timing matter?,yes,"YES, timing matters.

The evidence confirms that both early-life urban exposure and the proportion of urban life years are independently associated with increased risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Thailand. Specifically, the study found that individuals who spent their early life in an urban area may be more susceptible to the effects of increasing urban exposure on certain biological risk factors. This suggests that the timing of urban exposure, particularly during critical periods of development, can have a lasting impact on NCD risk.

Research shows that the proportion of urban life years is positively correlated with increased behavioral and physiological risk factors, highlighting the importance of considering the duration of urban exposure in assessing NCD risk. Furthermore, the study's findings imply that early-life urban exposure may have a compounding effect on NCD risk, particularly for biological risk factors.

While the study's cross-sectional design and limited sample size may have limitations, the findings provide valuable insights into the relationship between urbanicity and NCD risk in Thailand, emphasizing the significance of considering the timing and duration of urban exposure in public health strategies.",Success
Does a febrile reaction to platelets predispose recipients to red blood cell alloimmunization?,yes,"Yes, a febrile reaction to platelets predisposes recipients to red blood cell alloimmunization.

The evidence confirms that the alloimmunization rate among recipients who experienced a febrile transfusion reaction (FTR) to platelets was significantly higher (8%) compared to the control group (3%), with a p-value of 0.026. This suggests a statistically significant association between FTR to platelets and increased risk of RBC alloimmunization.",Success
Maternal creatine homeostasis is altered during gestation in the spiny mouse: is this a metabolic adaptation to pregnancy?,yes,"Yes, the evidence confirms that maternal creatine homeostasis is altered during gestation in the spiny mouse, and this alteration can be considered a metabolic adaptation to pregnancy.

Research shows that plasma creatine concentration and renal creatine excretion decreased significantly from mid to late gestation, indicating a shift in creatine homeostasis. Additionally, the study found increased lean tissue, kidney, liver, and heart mass at term, which suggests that the maternal body is adapting to support the growing fetus. The up-regulation of CrT1 expression in the heart and skeletal muscle, as well as increased creatine content in the heart and kidney, further supports this notion.

Moreover, the study found changes in the expression of creatine-synthesizing enzymes, such as AGAT and GAMT, in various tissues, including the kidney, heart, and brain. These changes suggest that the maternal body is adjusting its creatine synthesis and transport mechanisms to meet the increased demand for creatine during pregnancy.

While the study was conducted in spiny mice, the findings provide valuable insights into the metabolic adaptations that occur during pregnancy to support fetal growth and development.",Success
Spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with resection of the splenic vessels. Should one rely on the short gastric arteries?,no,"No, one should not rely on the short gastric arteries for blood supply to the spleen after a spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with resection of the splenic vessels.

The evidence confirms that perfusion of cadaveric arteries showed no effective direct or indirect communication between the left gastric and short gastric arteries. Intraoperative color Doppler ultrasound also failed to detect any hilar arterial blood flow after clamping the splenic and left gastroepiploic arteries, and clamping the short gastric arteries did not change flow parameters. Furthermore, post-operative CT angiography did not demonstrate the short gastric vessels supplying the spleen in any case. Instead, the gastroepiploic arcade was consistently found to be the main arterial pathway feeding the spleen.

These findings collectively suggest that the short gastric arteries are not a reliable source of blood supply to the spleen after a spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with resection of the splenic vessels.",Success
Delayed peripheral facial palsy in the stapes surgery: can it be prevented?,yes,"Yes, delayed peripheral facial palsy in stapes surgery can be prevented.

The evidence confirms that a history of recurrent labial herpetic lesions is a significant risk factor for poststapedectomy-delayed facial palsy. In this study, all 7 patients who developed delayed facial palsy had a history of recurrent labial herpetic lesions. Furthermore, the presence of increased IgG antibody titers against HSV-1 in 6 out of 7 patients with delayed facial palsy suggests a possible etiopathogenic role of herpes simplex virus in the development of this complication.

Research shows that acyclovir therapy can effectively treat and prevent delayed facial palsy in patients with a history of recurrent labial herpetic lesions. In this study, 6 out of 7 patients who received acyclovir therapy recovered completely.

Preventive measures, such as identifying and managing patients with a history of recurrent labial herpetic lesions, may reduce the incidence of delayed facial palsy in stapes surgery. Additionally, considering antiviral prophylaxis in high-risk patients may be beneficial in preventing this complication.",Success
Staging laparoscopy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: is it useful?,no,"Yes, staging laparoscopy (SL) is useful in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The evidence confirms that SL can change treatment strategy, preventing unnecessary open exploration, and provides valuable information on fibrosis/cirrhosis through biopsy of the nontumorous liver. In this study, SL showed a yield of 7% (95% CI, 3-17%) and accuracy of 27% (95% CI, 11-52%) in identifying unresectable tumors or metastases, leading to changes in management for 7.1% of patients. Additionally, biopsy of the contralateral liver led to changes in management for 17% of patients with cirrhosis. While the study's limitations include a small sample size and potential selection bias, the findings suggest that SL can be a valuable tool in the management of HCC patients.",Success
Can echocardiography and ECG discriminate hereditary transthyretin V30M amyloidosis from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?,yes,"Yes, echocardiography and ECG can discriminate hereditary transthyretin V30M amyloidosis from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 

The evidence confirms that a combination of ECG and echocardiographic features can accurately differentiate between ATTR amyloidosis and HCM. Specifically, a QRS voltage >30 mm is diagnostic for HCM, while an interventricular septal/posterior wall thickness ratio (IVSt/PWt) >1.6 is consistent with HCM, and a ratio <1.6 supports the diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis. This classification has been shown to have high sensitivity (0.939) and specificity (0.833), indicating its reliability in making an accurate diagnosis.",Success
Nasal polyposis: is there an inheritance pattern?,yes,"Yes, the study suggests a potential inheritance pattern in nasal polyposis (NP).

The evidence confirms that within the studied family, 19.7% of individuals older than 17 years were affected by NP, which is significantly higher than the national French prevalence of 2.1%. This finding implies a possible hereditary factor contributing to the development of NP in this family. Research shows that 13 out of 99 family members had a personal history of NP without any underlying conditions known to be associated with the disease, further supporting the notion of a potential genetic component.",Success
Pharmacologic regimens for knee osteoarthritis prevention: can they be cost-effective?,yes,"Yes, pharmacologic regimens for knee osteoarthritis prevention can be cost-effective, but only under specific conditions and for high-risk populations.

The evidence confirms that for the high-risk cohort (obese with a history of knee injury), the base case DMOAD regimen increased quality-adjusted life-years by 0.04 and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $118,000 per QALY gained, which is below the commonly cited cost-effectiveness threshold of $150,000 per QALY gained in the US.

However, the study also shows that for cohorts with lower risk profiles, such as those with knee injury only, obesity only, or no risk factors, the base case DMOAD regimen was less cost-effective or had ICERs above $150,000 per QALY gained. Additionally, regimens priced at $3,000 per year and higher demonstrated ICERs above cost-effectiveness thresholds.

These findings suggest that pharmacologic regimens for knee osteoarthritis prevention can be cost-effective, but the key factors influencing cost-effectiveness are the risk profile of the population and the price of the regimen.",Success
Production of chemokines by perivascular adipose tissue: a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis?,yes,"YES, the production of chemokines by perivascular adipose tissue (pWAT) plays a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

The evidence confirms that pWAT produces proinflammatory chemokines, such as interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, which induce the chemotaxis of peripheral blood leukocytes, including granulocytes, monocytes, and activated T cells. This prochemotactic activity of pWAT may contribute to the accumulation of macrophages and T cells at the interface between pWAT and the adventitia of human atherosclerotic aortas, exacerbating chronic inflammation and atherosclerosis.

Research shows that the proximity of pWAT to vascular walls, particularly at sites prone to atherosclerosis, and the increased amount of pWAT in response to a high-fat diet, further support the role of pWAT-derived chemokines in atherosclerosis.",Success
Household and food shopping environments: do they play a role in socioeconomic inequalities in fruit and vegetable consumption?,no,"No, the study found that household and food shopping environmental factors do not contribute to socioeconomic inequalities in fruit and vegetable consumption.

The evidence confirms that while there are significant socioeconomic inequalities in fruit and vegetable consumption, with odds ratios of 4.26 and 5.47 among the lowest-educated groups for not consuming fruit and vegetables, respectively, these inequalities are not explained by household or food shopping environmental factors. In fact, only a few of these factors were significantly associated with fruit and vegetable consumption, and their prevalence was low.",Success
Does birth center care during a woman's first pregnancy have any impact on her future reproduction?,no,"NO, the evidence suggests that birth center care during a woman's first pregnancy does not have a significant impact on her future reproduction.

Research shows that in this randomized controlled trial, there was no statistical difference found between the birth center group and the standard care group in terms of time to second birth, with a median time of 2.85 years and 2.82 years, respectively (log-rank 1.26; p=0.26). This suggests that the model of care during the first pregnancy did not affect the timing of subsequent births.",Success
Could Adult European Pharmacoresistant Epilepsy Patients Be Treated With Higher Doses of Zonisamide?,yes,"Yes, the evidence suggests that adult European pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients can be treated with higher doses of zonisamide.

Research shows that in this study, 55% of patients experienced a significant reduction in seizures (>50%) when taking high doses of zonisamide (>500 mg/d), with a mean dose of 633 mg/d. Furthermore, 66% of patients had good tolerance to high doses of other antiepileptic drugs, indicating that they may be able to handle higher doses of zonisamide as well. Although adverse events were observed in 37% of patients, the study suggests that high doses of zonisamide can be effective and relatively well-tolerated in this patient population.

It is essential to note that plasma levels of zonisamide were only available for two patients, and both were within the therapeutic range, which supports the efficacy and safety of high doses of zonisamide in these patients. However, it is crucial to consider the limitations of this study, including the small sample size and the lack of plasma level data for most patients. Further investigation is necessary to confirm these findings and establish the optimal dosing range for zonisamide in adult European pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients.",Success
Does early migraine treatment shorten time to headache peak and reduce its severity?,yes,"Yes, early migraine treatment shortens the time to headache peak, but no, it does not reduce its severity.

The evidence confirms that treating migraines within 15 minutes of onset reduces the time from headache onset to peak, with a mean time of 1.9 hours compared to 8.9 hours for those who waited 4 or more hours. This finding is supported by multivariate analysis, which shows that early treatment is significantly associated with shorter time from onset to headache peak.

However, despite shortening the time to peak, early treatment did not reduce headache severity at peak. This suggests that while early intervention may hasten the progression of the migraine, it does not mitigate its severity.

It's essential to note that the use of triptans was also found to be significantly associated with shorter time from onset to headache peak, highlighting the importance of considering medication type in migraine management.",Success
Post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage: is it a preferably night-time event?,yes,"Yes, the evidence confirms that post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage is a preferably night-time event. 

Research shows that out of 59 cases of post-operative late haemorrhage, 42 episodes (71.2%) occurred in the night-time, which is a statistically significant difference (p=0.002) compared to day-time haemorrhages. This suggests that there is a higher likelihood of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage occurring during the night-time.",Success
Acute hepatitis C in Israel: a predominantly iatrogenic disease?,yes,"Yes, the evidence suggests that acute hepatitis C in Israel is predominantly iatrogenic.

Research shows that in this study, 65% of acute hepatitis C cases were attributed to iatrogenic transmission, involving various medical procedures and clinical settings. This finding indicates that iatrogenic transmission is the most common mode of transmission in this population, surpassing injecting drug use, which was the second most common route of infection. The study's results highlight the importance of addressing iatrogenic transmission in the prevention and control of acute hepatitis C in Israel.",Success
Is Alveolar Macrophage Phagocytic Dysfunction in Children With Protracted Bacterial Bronchitis a Forerunner to Bronchiectasis?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that alveolar macrophage phagocytic dysfunction is a characteristic feature of both protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) and bronchiectasis in children, suggesting that it may be a forerunner to bronchiectasis. Research shows that children with PBB or bronchiectasis have significantly lower macrophage phagocytic capacity compared to control subjects, with median phagocytosis of NTHi being 16% for PBB and 13.7% for bronchiectasis, versus 19.0% for control subjects. Additionally, efferocytosis was also impaired in both PBB and bronchiectasis groups, with median values of 16.2% and 14.1%, respectively, compared to 18.1% in control subjects. These findings suggest that defective alveolar macrophage phagocytosis may contribute to the development of bronchiectasis in children with PBB.",Success
Do elderly patients benefit from surgery in addition to radiotherapy for treatment of metastatic spinal cord compression?,no,"No, the evidence suggests that elderly patients do not benefit from surgery in addition to radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic spinal cord compression.

Research shows that the matched-pair analysis comparing surgery followed by radiotherapy to radiotherapy alone did not reveal significant differences in motor function, local control, and survival rates between the two groups. Specifically, the improvement of motor function, 1-year local control rates, and 1-year survival rates were similar between the S + RT and RT groups. Additionally, the subgroup analyses for patients receiving direct decompressive surgery plus stabilization of involved vertebrae (DDSS) and laminectomy (LE) also did not demonstrate significant benefits from adding surgery to radiotherapy.

The most significant statistical findings that support this answer are:

* Improvement of motor function: 21% after S + RT vs. 24% after RT (p = 0.39)
* 1-year local control rates: 81% after S + RT vs. 91% after RT (p = 0.44)
* 1-year survival rates: 46% after S + RT vs. 39% after RT (p = 0.71)

These findings suggest that, for elderly patients with metastatic spinal cord compression, radiotherapy alone may be a sufficient treatment approach, and adding surgery may not provide significant additional benefits.",Success
Are WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers appropriate in the South African context?,no,"NO, the evidence suggests that the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers are not nutritionally adequate in the South African context.

Research shows that when mixed with water, sugar, and various micronutrient supplements, powdered full cream milk (PM) and fresh full cream milk (FM) failed to provide adequate amounts of essential micronutrients, including vitamins E and C, folic acid, iodine, selenium, zinc, and pantothenic acid. Specifically, PM and FM provided less than 50% of the estimated required amounts for these micronutrients. Furthermore, FM prepared with any micronutrient supplement provided no more than 32% of the recommended vitamin D intake.

Additionally, the study found that PM and FM preparations provided only 8-60% of the recommended amounts of vitamins A, E, and C, folic acid, manganese, zinc, and iodine compared to commercial formula. The preparations also fell short of providing adequate essential fatty acids, with only 11% of the minimum recommended linoleic acid and 67% of the minimum recommended alpha-linolenic acid per 450 ml mixture.

While the cost of PM and FM was found to be relatively lower than commercial formula, approximately 20% of the monthly income averaged over the first six months of life, the nutritional inadequacies of these replacement milks cannot be overlooked.

In conclusion, the evidence suggests that the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks are not suitable for infants of HIV-infected mothers in the South African context due to their nutritional inadequacies.",Success
Is minilaparoscopic inguinal hernia repair feasible?,yes,"Yes, minilaparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is feasible. The evidence confirms that in a study of 303 patients, no conversions to laparoscopy or an anterior open approach were required, and the incidence of minor complications was as low as 0.3%. This suggests that miniTAPP is a viable and safe surgical approach for inguinal hernia repair.",Success
Are Reviewers' Scores Influenced by Citations to Their Own Work?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that manuscripts containing citations to the reviewer's work receive higher evaluation scores than those that do not. Research shows that the mean score of reviews by cited reviewers (2.8) is higher than that of noncited reviewers (2.5), with a difference of 0.3 (95% CI 0 to 0.6). Although the difference is small, the ordinal regression model suggests that citations to the reviewer's work are associated with higher manuscript desirability scores, even after adjusting for manuscript quality.",Success
Does the central venous pressure predict fluid responsiveness?,no,"NO, the central venous pressure does not predict fluid responsiveness.

The evidence confirms that the summary area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.54-0.58), indicating a poor predictive ability of central venous pressure for fluid responsiveness. Additionally, the summary correlation coefficient between the baseline central venous pressure and change in stroke volume index/cardiac index was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.1-0.25), which is a weak correlation. These findings suggest that central venous pressure is not a reliable indicator of fluid responsiveness.",Success
Memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT as a diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease?,yes,"Yes, memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT (MP-SPECT) can be a useful diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease.

The evidence confirms that MP-SPECT can increase the diagnostic sensitivity of rCBF-SPECT in differentiating between AD patients and normal controls. In this study, the AD group showed a significant reduction in rCBF in the left parietal cortex compared to healthy elderly when using MP-SPECT, whereas no significant group differences were seen at rest. This suggests that the memory-provoked task can help identify specific brain regions affected in AD, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy.

Research shows that the use of MP-SPECT can be particularly useful in the early stages of AD, where symptoms may be mild and diagnosis can be challenging. By incorporating a memory-provoked task, clinicians may be able to detect subtle changes in brain function that are not apparent at rest, allowing for earlier and more accurate diagnosis.

It is essential to note that this study had a small sample size, and further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the clinical utility of MP-SPECT in AD diagnosis. However, the results suggest that MP-SPECT has potential as a diagnostic tool and warrants further investigation.",Success
Is low birth weight a risk indicator for congenital cytomegalovirus infection?,no,"No, the study suggests that low birth weight is not a reliable risk indicator for congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.

The evidence confirms that only one out of the four newborns with detected CMV-DNA in umbilical cord blood had a birth weight below 2700 grams, while the other three had normal birth weights. This indicates that low birth weight is not a consistent predictor of congenital CMV infection. Additionally, the high prevalence of CMV-IgG antibodies (80-90%) in the tested newborns suggests that maternal immunity is common, which may not necessarily correlate with congenital infection. The study's findings imply that other factors should be considered for identifying newborns at risk of congenital CMV infection.",Success
Is external palliative radiotherapy for gallbladder carcinoma effective?,yes,"YES, external palliative radiotherapy can be an effective treatment option for unresectable gallbladder carcinoma.

The evidence confirms that in this case, the patient showed significant clinico-laboratory improvement and remained alive for at least 1 year after diagnosis, with no local extension of the tumor observed on abdominal CTs during follow-up. The use of external radiotherapy with a total dose of 3,000 cGy in 10 fractions resulted in improved performance status and prolonged survival.

Research shows that palliative radiotherapy can provide symptomatic relief and improve quality of life in patients with unresectable gallbladder carcinoma. While the role of radiotherapy in gallbladder cancer is not yet fully established, this case highlights its potential as a valuable treatment option for patients with advanced disease.

It is essential to note that the effectiveness of radiotherapy may vary depending on individual patient factors, tumor characteristics, and treatment regimens. Further investigation is necessary to fully elucidate the benefits and limitations of external palliative radiotherapy in gallbladder carcinoma. However, this case suggests that it can be a viable treatment option for patients with unresectable disease.",Success
Is discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes predictable in newborns?,yes,"YES, discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes is predictable in newborns.

The evidence confirms that certain maternal and infant factors, such as antenatal care status, mode of delivery, and nursery type, are significantly associated with discordant TEOAE and AABR outcomes. Specifically, the study found that infants with false-positives were more likely to be admitted into well-baby nursery, belong to mothers who attended antenatal care, or who delivered vaginally. Similarly, infants with true-positives were more likely to be delivered vaginally and have severe hyperbilirubinemia. The c-statistic of 0.73 indicates a moderate to good predictive ability of these factors in identifying discordant outcomes.",Success
Chemical shift MRI: is there any contribution to morphologic evaluation of solid breast masses?,yes,"YES, chemical shift MRI contributes to the morphologic evaluation of solid breast masses.

The evidence confirms that chemical shift subtraction images are valuable for demonstrating and differentiating both benign and malignant lesions in dense breasts, and for demonstrating and differentiating benign lesions in fatty breasts. Specifically, the study found that in dense breasts, chemical shift subtraction images had a significant contribution to the morphologic evaluation of solid breast masses, with a p-value of <0.05. Additionally, in fatty breasts, chemical shift subtraction images were valuable for demonstrating and differentiating benign lesions, with a p-value of <0.05.",Success
Substance use and HIV-related sexual behaviors among US high school students: are they related?,yes,"YES, substance use is related to HIV-related sexual behaviors among US high school students.

The evidence confirms that students who used marijuana, cocaine, or other illicit drugs had the greatest likelihood of engaging in sexual risk behaviors, such as having had sexual intercourse, having had four or more sex partners, and not using a condom at last sexual intercourse. Specifically, the adjusted odds ratios for these behaviors were highest among students who used these substances. Even students who used only alcohol or cigarettes had a significant increase in the likelihood of engaging in these risk behaviors.

Research shows that the 1990 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which collected data from a representative sample of 11,631 high school students, found a clear association between substance use and HIV-related sexual behaviors. The study's findings suggest that substance use is a significant predictor of sexual risk behaviors among high school students, highlighting the importance of addressing substance use as part of HIV prevention efforts.",Success
Does sex influence the response to intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke?,yes,"Yes, sex influences the response to intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke.

The evidence confirms that women have a higher mortality rate compared to men after receiving intravenous thrombolysis for acute ischemic stroke, with an odds ratio of 1.19 (95% CI, 1.10-1.29; P=0.00003). Additionally, men have a higher likelihood of functional independence at 3 months, although this difference disappears after adjusting for confounding variables. Notably, men also have a higher risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, with an odds ratio of 1.25 (95% CI, 1.04-1.51; P=0.02). These findings suggest that sex plays a role in the response to intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke, with women experiencing poorer outcomes in terms of mortality and men experiencing more favorable outcomes in terms of functional independence and a higher risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage.",Success
Does Paget's disease exist in India?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that Paget's disease exists in India, as demonstrated by this study of 21 patients with documented cases of Paget's disease in India. The study provides detailed demographic, clinical, biochemical, and radiological profiles of these patients, further supporting the existence of Paget's disease in India.",Success
Can vaginal pH be measured from the wet mount slide?,no,"NO.

The evidence confirms that measuring vaginal pH from wet mount microscopy slides after adding saline leads to systematic increases in pH, resulting in false positive readings. This is a consistent finding across all types of vaginal flora disturbances and infections studied, and affects both abnormal and normal/intermediate pH ranges.",Success
Does Molecular Genotype Provide Useful Information in the Management of Radioiodine Refractory Thyroid Cancers?,yes,"YES, molecular genotype provides useful information in the management of radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancers.

The evidence confirms that BRAF mutation status is a significant predictor of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancer treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Specifically, patients with BRAF mutations had a significantly longer median PFS (34.7 months) compared to those without BRAF mutations (11.6 months), with a hazard ratio of 0.29 (95% CI 0.09-0.98, p = 0.03). This suggests that BRAF mutation status can be used to guide therapy and predict treatment outcomes in this patient population. Additionally, the study found that poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC) histologic subtype was an independent prognostic factor for PFS, highlighting the importance of considering both molecular genotype and histologic subtype in treatment decisions.",Success
Follow-up of patients with new cardiovascular implantable electronic devices: are experts' recommendations implemented in routine clinical practice?,yes,"No, the experts' recommendations for follow-up of patients with new cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) are not fully implemented in routine clinical practice.

The evidence confirms that despite an improvement in follow-up rates over time, a significant proportion of patients do not receive the recommended follow-up care. Specifically, only 42.4% of eligible patients had an initial in-person visit within 2 to 12 weeks, and 22% did not have at least one in-person CIED follow-up visit within 1 year. These findings suggest that there is a gap between the recommended guidelines and actual clinical practice. Research shows that adherence to guidelines can improve patient outcomes, and further investigation is needed to identify barriers to implementation and develop strategies to improve follow-up care for patients with CIEDs.",Success
Does limb-salvage surgery offer patients better quality of life and functional capacity than amputation?,maybe,"Yes, limb-salvage surgery offers patients better functional capacity than amputation, but similar quality of life.

The evidence confirms that patients undergoing limb-salvage surgery had superior Physiological Cost Index scores, indicating better functional capacity, and Reintegration to Normal Living Index scores, suggesting improved reintegration into daily life. However, the Toronto Extremity Salvage scores and SF-36 scores, which assess quality of life, were similar in both groups. This suggests that while limb-salvage surgery may provide functional benefits, it does not necessarily translate to a significant improvement in overall quality of life compared to amputation.",Success
Cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism: are clinical predictors adequate?,no,"No, clinical predictors are not adequate in identifying cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism.

The evidence confirms that only neck tenderness was found to be a significant predictor, present in just 45.5% of the study group, indicating that clinical predictors are insufficient to accurately identify cervical spine fractures in this patient population.",Success
Do microbiological factors account for poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland?,yes,"Yes, microbiological factors, specifically the presence of certain bacteria such as Mycoplasma hominis, contribute to poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland.

The evidence confirms that unmarried pregnant women in this study had a higher risk of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and other pathological microflora, including M. hominis, which is a significant independent risk factor for poor pregnancy outcome. The study found that the risk of M. hominis was higher among unmarried women, particularly those who were younger and had a lower concentration of Lactobacillus spp.

The study's findings suggest that microbiological factors, such as the presence of M. hominis, may play a role in the poor pregnancy outcomes observed among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. However, it is essential to note that other socioeconomic factors, such as younger age, poor economic situation, and excessive smoking during pregnancy, also contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes in this population.

Research shows that addressing microbiological factors, such as BV and M. hominis, through targeted interventions may help improve pregnancy outcomes among unmarried pregnant women in Poland. Further investigation is needed to determine the most effective strategies for reducing the risk of poor pregnancy outcomes in this population.",Success
Should all patients be optimized to the same preoperative hemoglobin level to avoid transfusion in primary knee arthroplasty?,no,"No, not all patients should be optimized to the same preoperative hemoglobin level to avoid transfusion in primary knee arthroplasty.

The evidence confirms that the risk of transfusion is associated with poorer performance status, as measured by the ASA score, and lower preoperative Hb levels. Specifically, the odds ratio for transfusion increases by 3.8 for each g/dl below 13 g/dl. This suggests that patients with poorer performance status (ASA III/IV) and lower preoperative Hb levels are at higher risk of transfusion.

The study found that the estimated probability of transfusion varies significantly depending on the ASA score and preoperative Hb level. For ASA I/II patients, the estimated probability of transfusion ranges from 0.03 to 0.64, while for ASA III/IV patients, it ranges from 0.10 to 0.84. This indicates that a one-size-fits-all approach to preoperative Hb optimization may not be effective.

Instead, tailoring Hb optimization to individual patient characteristics, such as ASA score and preoperative Hb level, may be a more effective strategy to reduce the risk of transfusion in primary knee arthroplasty.",Success
Is there any relation between cervical cord plaques and discopathy in patients with multiple sclerosis?,yes,"YES, there is a significant relation between cervical cord plaques and discopathy in patients with multiple sclerosis.

The evidence confirms that in patients with MS, there is a strong correlation between the site of cervical discopathy and cervical spinal cord plaques. Specifically, 69.1% of patients with both conditions had cervical plaque at the same site as cervical discopathy, which is a statistically significant finding (P<0.05). This suggests that the presence of cervical discopathy is associated with an increased likelihood of developing cervical cord plaques at the same site.",Success
Is the processing of affective prosody influenced by spatial attention?,maybe,"Yes, the processing of affective prosody is influenced by spatial attention.

The evidence confirms that event-related potentials (ERPs) differed as a function of emotional prosody both when attended and when unattended, indicating that spatial attention modulates the processing of affective prosody. Specifically, the study found that emotional prosody effects interacted with effects of spatial attention at early processing levels (<200 ms), suggesting that spatial attention influences the initial processing of emotional prosody.",Success
Is there a role for leukocyte and CRP measurements in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly?,maybe,"Yes, there is a role for leukocyte and CRP measurements in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly.

The evidence confirms that in this study, none of the 73 elderly patients with acute appendicitis had both unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value, suggesting that these measurements can be useful in diagnosing acute appendicitis in this population. Specifically, the study found that 100% of patients with acute appendicitis had at least one of these values elevated, which can aid in the diagnostic process. While the study did not find a statistically significant difference in leukocyte counts or CRP values between patients with an uninflamed appendix and those with acute appendicitis, the absence of patients with both unelevated values in the acute appendicitis group highlights the potential utility of these measurements in diagnosis.",Success
Are bipolar disorders underdiagnosed in patients with depressive episodes?,maybe,"YES. The evidence confirms that bipolar disorders are underdiagnosed in patients with acute major depressive episodes. 

Research shows that the prevalence of bipolar disorder in patients with major depressive episodes varies significantly depending on the diagnostic algorithm used, ranging from 11.6% to 58.7% in this study. The disparity in prevalence rates suggests that bipolar disorders may be underrecognized or misdiagnosed, particularly when relying on traditional DSM-IV criteria. The modified DSM-IV criteria, Bipolarity Specifier Algorithm, and HCL-32R diagnostic approaches yielded higher prevalence rates, indicating that a substantial number of patients with bipolar disorder may be missed using conventional diagnostic methods.",Success
Does patient-prosthesis mismatch after aortic valve replacement affect survival and quality of life in elderly patients?,no,"NO, patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) after aortic valve replacement does not affect survival and quality of life in elderly patients.

The evidence confirms that overall survival at 5 years was 78 ± 4.5% and was not influenced by PPM (P = NS), indicating that PPM did not have a significant impact on survival. Additionally, the study found that quality of life (QoL) measures, including physical functioning, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, and social functioning, were similar between patients with PPM and those without PPM (P = NS). This suggests that PPM did not significantly affect QoL in elderly patients after aortic valve replacement.",Success
Does β-catenin have a role in pathogenesis of sebaceous cell carcinoma of the eyelid?,yes,"YES, β-catenin has a role in the pathogenesis of sebaceous cell carcinoma (SbCC) of the eyelid.

The evidence confirms that cytoplasmic overexpression of β-catenin is significantly associated with tumor size, orbital invasion, and pagetoid spread in SbCC, with a positive correlation found in tumors larger than 2 cm (p = 0.242). This suggests that β-catenin plays a role in the development and progression of SbCC.",Success
Is ultrasound equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis?,yes,"Maybe. 

The study found that both ultrasound and X-ray had similar detection rates for fractures, with 130 fractures identified using ultrasound and 148 using X-ray. However, when it came to identifying fracture type, X-ray had a slight advantage (80 correct results) compared to ultrasound (66 correct results). On the other hand, ultrasound was superior to X-ray for dislocation identification (51 correct results) compared to X-ray (41 correct results). 

It's essential to note that these findings were not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing. This means that while there were some differences between the two imaging modalities, they were not significant enough to conclusively state that one is superior to the other. Therefore, it cannot be definitively said that ultrasound is equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and establish the role of ultrasound in pediatric fracture diagnosis.",Success
Hearing loss: an unknown complication of pre-eclampsia?,yes,"YES, hearing loss is a complication of pre-eclampsia.

The evidence confirms that patients with pre-eclampsia have significantly higher hearing thresholds in both ears, particularly at higher frequencies (8, 10, and 12 kHz), compared to normotensive pregnant controls. Specifically, the study found that hearing thresholds in the right ear at 1, 4, 8, and 10 kHz and in the left ear at 8 and 10 kHz were significantly higher in patients with pre-eclampsia. Furthermore, the degree of systolic blood pressure at diagnosis was found to have a deteriorating effect on hearing at specific frequencies.

Research shows that pre-eclampsia is associated with hearing loss, particularly in the higher frequency range, and that the severity of hypertension is correlated with the degree of hearing impairment. These findings suggest that hearing loss is a previously underrecognized complication of pre-eclampsia.",Success
Medical student education in emergency medicine: do students meet the national standards for clinical encounters of selected core conditions?,no,"Yes, the majority of students (76.9%) meet the national standards for clinical encounters of selected core conditions, with an average of 8.4 core conditions seen per student during their 4-week EM clerkship.

The evidence confirms that students are exposed to a significant number of the recommended core conditions, with 15.4% of students seeing all 10 conditions and 76.9% seeing at least eight. The data also highlights that certain conditions, such as chest pain and abdominal pain, are almost universally encountered (100%), while others, like cardiac arrest, are less frequently seen (31%). These findings suggest that the clinical setting provides an opportunity for students to gain exposure to a wide range of emergent clinical conditions, meeting the national standards for clinical encounters.",Success
A model of healing of Los Angeles grades C and D reflux oesophagitis: is there an optimal time of acid suppression for maximal healing?,yes,"YES, there is an optimal time of acid suppression for maximal healing of reflux oesophagitis.

The evidence confirms that maximal reflux oesophagitis healing rates are achieved when intragastric pH > 4 is maintained for approximately 50-70% (12-17 hours) of the 24-hour period. Research shows that acid suppression above this threshold does not yield further increases in healing rates. This finding suggests that there is an optimal window of acid suppression for maximal healing, and exceeding this threshold does not provide additional benefits.",Success
Gadofosveset-enhanced MR angiography of carotid arteries: does steady-state imaging improve accuracy of first-pass imaging?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that steady-state imaging improves the accuracy of first-pass imaging in gadofosveset-enhanced MR angiography of carotid arteries. Research shows that steady-state imaging has higher sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value compared to first-pass imaging for grading stenosis and evaluating plaque morphology. Specifically, the study found that steady-state imaging had a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 95% for grading stenosis, compared to 90% and 92% for first-pass imaging, respectively. Similarly, for evaluating plaque morphology, steady-state imaging had a sensitivity of 98% and specificity of 97%, compared to 84% and 86% for first-pass imaging, respectively. The differences between the two imaging techniques were statistically significant (P<.001).",Success
Elephant trunk in a small-calibre true lumen for chronic aortic dissection: cause of haemolytic anaemia?,yes,"Yes, an elephant trunk in a small-calibre true lumen for chronic aortic dissection can cause haemolytic anaemia.

The evidence confirms that in both cases presented, the folded elephant trunk in the small-calibre true lumen led to the development of severe haemolytic anaemia. The anaemia improved after additional surgical interventions, including graft replacement of the descending aorta and stent grafting into the elephant trunk. These findings suggest a direct causal link between the elephant trunk in a small-calibre lumen and haemolytic anaemia.

Notably, the study's retrospective review of inpatient and outpatient records identified only two cases of haemolytic anaemia among patients who underwent aortic surgery using the elephant trunk technique between 2011 and 2013, highlighting the significance of these findings.",Success
Can p53 alterations be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer?,no,"No, p53 alterations cannot be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer.

The evidence confirms that, despite the presence of p53 alterations in 46% of tumours, there were no significant differences in tumour size reduction or local failure between the groups with p53 overexpression or p53 mutation compared with normal (P=0.18). This suggests that p53 alterations do not have a significant impact on predicting tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer.",Success
"Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections in patients with Crohn's disease: are abscesses, phlegmons, or recurrent disease contraindications?",no,"No, abscesses, phlegmons, or recurrent disease are not contraindications to laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections in patients with Crohn's disease.

The evidence confirms that laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections can be successfully performed in patients with Crohn's disease, even in the presence of abscesses, phlegmons, or recurrent disease. In this study, operative blood loss and time were lower in the laparoscopic groups (I, II, and III) compared to the open procedure group (IV). Additionally, morbidity was highest in the open procedure group (21%), while the laparoscopic groups had significantly lower morbidity rates (0%, 10%, and 10%, respectively). Although conversion to open procedure occurred in 5 patients, the overall results suggest that laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections are a viable option for patients with Crohn's disease, even in the presence of these complicating factors.",Success
Has the use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies by U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations changed from 2002 to 2007?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies by U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations increased from 2002 to 2007. Specifically, the age-standardized prevalence of overall CAM use rose from 30.6% in 2002 to 34.4% in 2007 (p<0.001).",Success
Is extended aortic replacement in acute type A dissection justifiable?,yes,"Yes, extended aortic replacement in acute type A dissection is justifiable.

The evidence confirms that complete replacement of all dissected tissue, as achieved in 21 patients (group 1), resulted in no early mortality or perioperative cerebrovascular events. In contrast, the group where replacement of all dissected tissue was not possible (group 2) had a significantly higher incidence of early mortality (4.7%) and perioperative cerebrovascular events (7.0%) (p<0.025). This suggests that extended aortic replacement can reduce the risk of adverse outcomes in acute type A dissection.",Success
Is intensive monitoring during the first transfusion in pediatric patients necessary?,no,"No, intensive monitoring during the first transfusion in pediatric patients is not necessary.

The evidence confirms that in this study, none of the 13 patients who experienced a reaction during their first transfusion required ICU management, and all reactions were clinically mild. This suggests that the risk of a severe reaction during the first transfusion is low. Additionally, the study found that severe reactions requiring ICU management occurred in subsequent transfusions, not during the first transfusion. This suggests that the focus should be on monitoring subsequent transfusions rather than the first transfusion.",Success
Effects of exercise training on heart rate and QT interval in healthy young individuals: are there gender differences?,yes,"YES, there are gender differences in the effects of exercise training on heart rate and QT interval in healthy young individuals.

The evidence confirms that exercise training reduces heart rate and increases heart rate variability in both men and women, regardless of gender differences in basal heart rate. However, when it comes to the QT interval, the study found that trained women showed a significant difference in mean 24-hour QTc compared to non-trained women, whereas no such difference was observed in men.

Moreover, exercise training reduced the QT/RR slope in both genders, but this effect was more pronounced in women, eliminating the gender difference in ventricular repolarization duration at low heart rate observed in sedentary subjects. This suggests that exercise training has a more significant impact on QT interval and ventricular repolarization in women compared to men.",Success
Is coeliac disease screening in risk groups justified?,yes,"YES, coeliac disease screening in risk groups is justified.

The evidence confirms that screen-detected coeliac patients, diagnosed 14 years ago, demonstrated high dietary compliance (96%) and similar quality of life, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bone mineral density compared to symptom-detected patients and non-coeliac controls. This suggests that early detection and treatment through screening can lead to improved health outcomes in coeliac disease patients. Specifically, the study found that screen-detected patients had similar quality of life and gastrointestinal symptoms to symptom-detected patients, and their bone mineral density was comparable to that of the general population. These findings support the justification for coeliac disease screening in risk groups.",Success
Analysis of the epidemiological pattern of Shigellosis in Barcelona between 1988 and 2012: Is it an emerging sexually transmitted infection?,yes,"Yes, the evidence suggests that Shigellosis is an emerging sexually transmitted infection (STI) in Barcelona, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM).

Research shows that between 1988 and 2012, there was a sustained increase in Shigellosis cases among males, especially those with no history of food poisoning or travel to endemic areas. This increase was more pronounced among males aged 21-60 years, with a significant rise in S. flexneri cases since 2009 and S. sonnei cases since 2004. Notably, in 2012, 63% of S. flexneri cases among men were MSM. These findings indicate a shift in the epidemiological pattern of Shigellosis, suggesting that it is emerging as an STI in this population.

It is essential to acknowledge that this study's findings are specific to the Barcelona context and may not be generalizable to other populations. However, the significant increase in Shigellosis cases among MSM and the correlation with sexual transmission cannot be ignored. Further investigation is necessary to confirm these findings and explore the implications for public health strategies.",Success
A patient with myelomeningocele: is untethering necessary prior to scoliosis correction?,no,"No, untethering is not necessary prior to scoliosis correction in patients with myelomeningocele.

The evidence confirms that in this study, 17 patients with radiographically confirmed tethered cords underwent spinal fusion for scoliosis correction without prior untethering, and none experienced new neurological deficits, shunt complications, or worsening of urological function. The mean Cobb angle correction was 57%, indicating successful scoliosis correction. Only one patient experienced transient lower extremity weakness, which resolved within a month. This study suggests that untethering may not be necessary prior to scoliosis correction in patients with myelomeningocele, especially when they do not exhibit clinically symptomatic tethered cord syndrome.",Success
Is aerobic workload positively related to ambulatory blood pressure?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that there is a significant positive relationship between relative aerobic workload and ambulatory blood pressure. Research shows that a 1% increase in mean relative aerobic workload is associated with an increase of 0.42 mmHg in systolic ABP and 0.30 mmHg in diastolic ABP. The correlations between relative aerobic workload and ABP were significant, with p-values < 0.001.",Success
PREVALENCE OF THE STREPTOCOCUS AGALACTIAE IN THE PREGNANT WOMAN FROM THE AUTONOMIC CITY OF MELILLA: IS CULTURE A DETERMINANT FACTOR?,yes,"Yes, culture is a determinant factor in the prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae in pregnant women from the Autonomous City of Melilla.

The evidence confirms that the prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae in Muslim women (24.7%) is significantly higher compared to Christian women (10.3%) and women from unknown cultures (5.6%). This suggests that cultural background is a determinant factor in the prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae in pregnant women from Melilla.

Research shows that the prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae also varies according to age, with a higher prevalence in women aged 26-34 years (22.2%) compared to women aged 25 years or less (17.9%) and women aged 35 years or more (15.9%).

It is essential to consider these findings in the context of the local population and cultural practices, as they may influence the prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae. Further investigation is necessary to explore the underlying reasons for these differences and to develop targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence of Streptococcus agalactiae in pregnant women from Melilla.",Success
Are virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction economically viable?,yes,"YES, virtual planning and guided surgery for head and neck reconstruction are economically viable.

The evidence confirms that the time saved during surgery using virtual planning and guided surgery can offset the additional cost of planning and cutting-guide production. In this study, the time saved resulted in a significant reduction of the additional cost of virtual planning, from $5,098 to $1,231.50 with a prebent plate and from $6,980 to $3,113.50 for a milled plate. This reduction in cost makes virtual planning and guided surgery a economically viable option for head and neck reconstruction.",Success
Biliary atresia: should all patients undergo a portoenterostomy?,no,"No, not all patients with biliary atresia should undergo a portoenterostomy.

The evidence confirms that histological criteria from preoperative liver biopsy can predict the outcome of portoenterostomy with a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 88%. Specifically, the presence of certain histological features such as syncitial giant cells, lobular inflammation, focal necrosis, bridging necrosis, and cholangitis are associated with failure of the procedure, while bile in zone 1 is associated with clinical success. This suggests that a selective approach to portoenterostomy based on preoperative biopsy results can help identify patients who are more likely to benefit from the surgery.",Success
Are stroke patients' reports of home blood pressure readings reliable?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that stroke patients' reports of home blood pressure readings are reliable. Research shows that 90% of booklet recordings matched the actual readings downloaded from the BP monitor, indicating a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, the average differences between booklet and monitor readings were minimal, with systolic readings being 0.6 mmHg lower and diastolic readings being 0.3 mmHg lower in the booklet recordings, which is within a clinically acceptable range. These findings suggest that stroke patients can reliably record their home blood pressure readings, which can be useful in hypertension management.",Success
Do dermatomyositis and polymyositis affect similar thigh muscles?,no,"No, dermatomyositis and polymyositis do not affect similar thigh muscles.

The evidence confirms that muscle oedema, a marker of active inflammation, is more common in dermatomyositis (DM) than in polymyositis (PM) in the anterior thigh muscles, with 68% of DM patients showing involvement of at least one anterior thigh muscle compared to 38% of PM patients (p=0.02). In contrast, the posterior thigh muscles were more commonly affected in PM. This suggests that DM and PM have distinct patterns of thigh muscle involvement.",Success
Juvenile ankylosing spondylitis--is it the same disease as adult ankylosing spondylitis?,no,"No, juvenile ankylosing spondylitis (JAS) is not the same disease as adult ankylosing spondylitis (AAS). | 

The evidence confirms that JAS and AAS have distinct clinical presentations and outcomes in the Indian population. In this study, patients with JAS had a higher male preponderance, more frequent onset with peripheral arthritis, and greater involvement of hip and knee joints compared to those with AAS. Additionally, valvular dysfunction was exclusively seen in patients with JAS, suggesting a different disease profile. These findings are consistent with previous studies in Caucasians, which also demonstrated differences between JAS and AAS. While both forms of AS share some common characteristics, the distinct features of JAS suggest that it is a unique entity with different clinical and outcome patterns compared to AAS.",Success
Is Aspiration Thrombectomy Beneficial in Patients Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention?,no,"NO, aspiration thrombectomy is not associated with a significant reduction in the risk of mortality, reinfarction, or the combined outcome of mortality or reinfarction in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

The evidence confirms that, in a meta-analysis of 17 trials with 20,960 patients, aspiration thrombectomy did not demonstrate a significant benefit in reducing mortality (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.76-1.04; P=0.13), reinfarction (RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.73-1.17; P=0.52), or the combined outcome of mortality or reinfarction (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.79-1.02; P=0.11) compared to conventional PCI. Additionally, the use of intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or ischemic time did not modify these findings.",Success
Can static foot posture measurements predict regional plantar surface area?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that a combination of static foot posture measurements can be used to predict regional plantar surface area, specifically forefoot and midfoot plantar contact area, in individuals with pronated or normal foot types. Research shows that a two-variable model can predict forefoot plantar contact area with a high degree of accuracy (r(2)=0.79, p<0.0001), and a four-variable model can predict midfoot plantar contact area in individuals with a 1.26cm or greater change in midfoot width (r(2)=0.85, p<0.0001).",Success
Can dentists recognize manipulated digital radiographs?,no,"NO, the evidence suggests that dentists are not able to reliably recognize manipulated digital radiographs.

Research shows that in this study, the distribution of correct identifications was similar to a random distribution, indicating that the dentists' ability to detect manipulated radiographs was no better than chance. Notably, none of the 39 participating dentists were able to correctly identify all six manipulated radiographs, and five dentists only correctly identified one manipulated radiograph. Furthermore, an authentic radiograph was mistakenly identified as manipulated more frequently than expected, highlighting the difficulty dentists face in distinguishing between genuine and manipulated radiographs.",Success
Is delayed gastric emptying following pancreaticoduodenectomy related to pylorus preservation?,no,"Yes, the evidence suggests that delayed gastric emptying (DGE) following pancreaticoduodenectomy is related to pylorus preservation. 

Research shows that in this study, the overall incidence of DGE was 12% (n=6) after pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD). Furthermore, the study found a significant association between postoperative complications and DGE, with 30% of patients experiencing DGE when other complications occurred (P=0.002). This suggests that pylorus preservation is a contributing factor to the development of DGE.",Success
Is Overexpression of Ki-67 a Prognostic Biomarker of Upper Tract Urinary Carcinoma?,yes,"**Yes**, overexpression of Ki-67 is a prognostic biomarker of upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC).

The evidence confirms that high Ki-67 expression is associated with aggressive tumor behavior, poorer cancer-specific survival (CSS), and disease-free survival (DFS) in UTUC patients. The study's immunohistochemistry results and meta-analysis of 12 published studies, including 1740 patients, demonstrate a significant correlation between Ki-67 overexpression and poor prognosis. Specifically, the pooled hazard ratio (HR) estimates indicate that increased Ki-67 levels are associated with poor survival (HR=2.081) and disease progression (HR=2.791). Subgroup analysis further supports the significance of Ki-67 overexpression in predicting cancer-specific survival (HR=2.276), metastasis-free survival (HR=3.008), and disease-free survival (HR=6.336). These findings suggest that Ki-67 is a valuable prognostic biomarker for UTUC, enabling clinicians to identify high-risk patients and tailor treatment strategies accordingly.",Success
Chemoradiation instead of surgery to treat mid and low rectal tumors: is it safe?,no,"No, chemoradiation instead of surgery to treat mid and low rectal tumors is not safe.

The evidence confirms that, despite achieving complete response (CR) with chemoradiation, local recurrence rates remain high. In this study, 8 out of 10 patients with CR after chemoradiation experienced local recurrence within 3.7 to 8.8 months. This suggests that chemoradiation alone may not be sufficient to eradicate the tumor, and surgery is still necessary to ensure optimal treatment outcomes. Additionally, the study highlights that lymph node metastases and perineural invasion are significant negative predictors of overall survival, further emphasizing the importance of surgical intervention.",Success
Are there effects of intrauterine cocaine exposure on delinquency during early adolescence?,no,"No, there is no significant association between intrauterine cocaine exposure and delinquent behavior during early adolescence.

The evidence confirms that, after controlling for other prenatal exposures and relevant psychosocial factors, level of intrauterine cocaine exposure (IUCE) is not significantly associated with delinquent behavior in early adolescence. Specifically, the study found that 26% of participants reported ≥ 3 delinquent behaviors, but this was not linked to IUCE. Instead, the study identified significant associations with intrauterine exposure to cigarettes and childhood exposure to violence. Research shows that other factors, such as prenatal cigarette exposure and childhood violence exposure, play a more significant role in early adolescent delinquency.",Success
Thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair: is reimplantation of spinal cord arteries a waste of time?,yes,"NO, reimplantation of spinal cord arteries is not a waste of time.

The evidence confirms that preserving spinal cord arteries during thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair is crucial in preventing paraplegia. In this study, despite sacrificing an average of 8.0 segmental artery pairs, including 4.5 pairs between T7 and L1 where the artery of Adamkiewicz is presumed to arise, only 2 patients (2%) developed postoperative paraplegia. Notably, one of these cases was attributed to an intraoperative dissection, and the other was related to a respiratory arrest. The preservation of spinal cord arteries, as monitored by MEP and SSEP, played a significant role in maintaining spinal cord function in 99% of the patients.

While this study's findings are promising, it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of the research, including the small sample size and the potential for variability in individual patient outcomes. Nevertheless, the data suggests that reimplantation of spinal cord arteries is a valuable strategy in reducing the risk of paraplegia during thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair.",Success
Is year of radical prostatectomy a predictor of outcome in prostate cancer?,yes,"YES, the year of radical prostatectomy is a predictor of outcome in prostate cancer, specifically when considering preoperative factors. 

The evidence confirms that the year of radical prostatectomy is a significant predictor of outcome, with a p-value of 0.006 in the preoperative analysis. This suggests that patients who underwent surgery in later years, up to the mid-1990s, had better outcomes compared to those who underwent surgery in earlier years. However, it's essential to note that this association is not seen when considering postoperative factors, with a p-value of 0.130. This study's findings imply that advances in surgical techniques, diagnostic tools, or other factors may have contributed to the improved outcomes over time.",Success
Does health information exchange reduce redundant imaging?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that health information exchange (HIE) adoption is associated with significant reductions in repeat imaging in emergency departments (EDs). Research shows that HIE participation led to a decrease in repeat imaging for computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and chest x-ray, with reductions ranging from 44% to 67% relative to sample means. Specifically, the study found that HIE was associated with an 8.7 percentage point decrease in repeat CT imaging, a 9.1 percentage point decrease in repeat ultrasound imaging, and a 13.0 percentage point decrease in repeat chest x-ray imaging. These findings suggest that HIE can help reduce redundant care and improve healthcare efficiency.",Success
Is a pressor necessary during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy of cardiac arrest?,yes,"YES, a pressor is necessary during aortic perfusion and oxygenation therapy of cardiac arrest.

The evidence confirms that the use of exogenous epinephrine during selective aortic perfusion and oxygenation (SAPO) significantly improves aortic and coronary perfusion pressures, leading to a higher rate of return of spontaneous circulation. In this study, the mean aortic relaxation pressure increased by 58 mm Hg in animals receiving epinephrine, compared to 20 mm Hg in those receiving saline placebo. Similarly, the coronary perfusion pressure increased by 52 mm Hg in the epinephrine group, versus 26 mm Hg in the placebo group. Most notably, 7 out of 8 animals in the epinephrine group achieved return of spontaneous circulation, compared to only 2 out of 7 in the placebo group. These findings strongly suggest that the use of a pressor, such as epinephrine, is necessary to optimize the efficacy of SAPO during cardiac arrest.",Success
Do people who were passive smokers during childhood have increased risk of long-term work disability?,yes,"Yes, people who were passive smokers during childhood have an increased risk of long-term work disability. The evidence confirms that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home during childhood is associated with a higher incidence of long-term sick leave, particularly due to neck and back pain.",Success
Motor performance in chronic low back pain: is there an influence of pain-related cognitions?,yes,"Yes, pain-related cognitions influence motor performance in chronic low back pain.

The evidence confirms that patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) performed worse in a hand-function task, especially in the provoking condition, which was designed to elicit pain-related cognitions. Specifically, 54% of patients showed deteriorated performance in the provoking condition, indicating that pain-related cognitions had a negative impact on their motor performance. This is evident from the significant group*condition interaction, which suggests that patients and healthy subjects responded differently to the three conditions. The study's findings imply that pain-related cognitions, such as pain expectancy, play a role in impairing motor performance in CLBP patients.",Success
Patient comprehension of emergency department care and instructions: are patients aware of when they do not understand?,no,"No, patients are not aware of when they do not understand. The evidence confirms that the majority of patients with comprehension deficits failed to perceive them, with only 20% of patients perceiving difficulty with comprehension when they demonstrated deficient comprehension.",Success
Can mandibular depiction be improved by changing the thickness of double-oblique computed tomography images?,no,"Yes, mandibular depiction can be improved by changing the thickness of double-oblique computed tomography images.

The evidence confirms that the highest value for mandibular depiction was obtained with 0.9 mm-thick images, specifically in the alveolar crest and the whole of the mandibular canal. Although there was no significant difference between 0.3 mm and 0.9 mm-thick images, the study suggests that optimizing the thickness of double-oblique CT images can enhance mandibular depiction.",Success
Inhibin: a new circulating marker of hydatidiform mole?,yes,"YES, inhibin can be considered a new circulating marker of hydatidiform mole.

The evidence confirms that serum inhibin concentrations were significantly higher in patients with hydatidiform mole (median 8.3 U/ml) compared to normal women at the same stage of pregnancy (2.8 U/ml). Additionally, inhibin concentrations in molar tissue were also present in high concentrations (578 U/ml cytosol). Furthermore, a significant decline in serum inhibin concentrations was observed after evacuation of the mole, with values returning to those seen in the follicular phase of normal menstrual cycles. Notably, none of the patients with serum inhibin concentrations ≤0.4 U/ml after evacuation developed persistent trophoblastic disease. These findings suggest that inhibin may be a useful clinical marker for hydatidiform mole.",Success
Is the fibronectin-aggrecan complex present in cervical disk disease?,yes,"Yes, the fibronectin-aggrecan complex (FAC) is present in cervical disk disease. 

The evidence confirms that the optical density of the FAC at 450 nm was 0.151 (0.036; 0.1-0.32) in the lavage fluid of patients undergoing surgical treatment for cervical radiculopathy caused by disk herniation. This finding suggests the presence of FAC in cervical disk disease. Furthermore, a statistically significant correlation was found between FAC and pH (P = .008), indicating a relationship between FAC and the inflammatory environment in the disk space.",Success
Does peritoneal dialysis affect halitosis in patients with end-stage renal disease?,yes,"YES, peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy significantly reduces halitosis levels in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 

The evidence confirms that after 3 months of PD therapy, halitosis levels decreased significantly, with a mean halitosis level of 2.39 ± 0.60 compared to 3.90 ± 0.37 before PD therapy. This reduction in halitosis is correlated with a significant decrease in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and an increase in salivary flow rates. The study found a statistically significant positive correlation between halitosis and BUN levels, and a negative correlation between halitosis and salivary flow rates, both before and after PD therapy. These findings suggest that PD therapy has a positive impact on halitosis in ESRD patients, likely due to the reduction in uremic toxins and improvement in oral health.",Success
Can elevated troponin I levels predict complicated clinical course and inhospital mortality in patients with acute pulmonary embolism?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels are associated with a complicated clinical course and in-hospital mortality in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Research shows that patients with elevated cTnI levels have a higher prevalence of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 3.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82-9.29), complicated clinical course (P<.001), and right ventricular dysfunction (P<.001). Additionally, elevated cTnI levels are linked to a higher risk of adverse clinical events, including hypotension, thrombolysis, need for mechanical ventilation, and need for inotropic support.",Success
Is transurethral catheterisation the ideal method of bladder drainage?,no,"No, transurethral catheterisation is not the ideal method of bladder drainage.

The evidence confirms that transurethral catheterisation is associated with significant discomfort and a high incidence of urinary tract infections. In this study, male patients reported higher dissatisfaction scores and more pain during and after catheterisation. Furthermore, half of the patients experienced symptoms of urinary tract infection after catheter removal. These findings suggest that transurethral catheterisation may not be the most optimal method of bladder drainage, particularly in terms of patient comfort and infection risk.",Success
Inpatient Pediatric Tonsillectomy: Does Hospital Type Affect Cost and Outcomes of Care?,yes,"YES, hospital type is associated with differences in total cost and outcomes for inpatient tonsillectomy in pediatric patients.

The evidence confirms that children's teaching hospitals (CTHs) had significantly higher risk-adjusted total cost and length of stay (LOS) per tonsillectomy compared with non-children's teaching hospitals (NCTHs) and nonteaching hospitals (NTHs). Specifically, the total cost per tonsillectomy was $9423.34 in CTHs, $6250.78 in NCTHs, and $5905.10 in NTHs (P<.001). Additionally, CTHs had higher odds of major perioperative complications, such as hemorrhage, respiratory failure, and death, compared with NCTHs (odds ratio [OR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.15-1.91; P = .002).

It's essential to note that CTHs were more likely to care for patients with comorbidities (P<.001), which may have contributed to the increased cost and complications. However, the risk-adjusted models accounted for these comorbidities, suggesting that hospital type is an independent factor affecting cost and outcomes.",Success
Does anterior laxity of the uninjured knee influence clinical outcomes of ACL reconstruction?,yes,"YES, the anterior laxity of the uninjured knee influences clinical outcomes of ACL reconstruction.

The evidence confirms that patients with greater anterior laxity in the uninjured knee (>7.5 mm) had significantly worse clinical outcomes, including greater side-to-side differences in anterior laxity (2.9 ± 1.4 mm) and lower functional scores (Lysholm score: 85.4 ± 6.6, IKDC subjective score: 82.6 ± 8.2) compared to patients with less anterior laxity (<5 mm or 5-7.5 mm) in the uninjured knee. Specifically, post hoc testing showed that Group 3 had significantly greater anterior laxity (p ≤ 0.039) and lower functional scores (p ≤ 0.001) compared with Groups 1 and 2.",Success
Prostate-specific antigen and free prostate-specific antigen in the early detection of prostate cancer: do combination tests improve detection?,yes,"YES, combination tests improve detection in the early detection of prostate cancer.

The evidence confirms that combination tests, which include both total and free prostate-specific antigen (PSA), demonstrate improved detection capabilities compared to using total PSA alone. In this study, the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for combination tests was 0.76, slightly higher than the AUC of 0.74 for total PSA. Moreover, 29 out of 35 test-train splits identified combination tests with higher sensitivity and specificity than the traditional PSA threshold of 4.0 ng/mL, extending the reflex range to below 4.0 ng/mL. While the overall diagnostic performance did not differ significantly between tests, the combination tests showed improved detection capabilities.",Success
Can homemade alcohol (Raksi) be useful for preserving dead bodies?,yes,"Yes, the evidence confirms that homemade alcohol (Raksi) can be useful for preserving dead bodies, at least temporarily. 

Research shows that in this study, Raksi was able to arrest postmortem changes in rats up to 72 hours, demonstrating its potential as a preservative and disinfectant. The 34% alcohol content in Raksi likely contributed to its effectiveness in preventing putrefactive changes, gas liberation, and tissue liquefaction. While the study's results are promising, it's essential to acknowledge that the experiment was conducted on rats and may not directly translate to human bodies. Further investigation is necessary to determine the long-term efficacy and safety of using Raksi for human embalming.",Success
Can common carotid intima media thickness serve as an indicator of both cardiovascular phenotype and risk among black Africans?,yes,"YES, common carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) can serve as an indicator of both cardiovascular phenotype and risk among black Africans.

The evidence confirms that CIMT differed significantly among individuals with distinct cardiovascular phenotypes, and it correlated significantly with traditional cardiovascular risk factors in a black African population. Specifically, CIMT had a higher c-statistic for differentiating stroke versus normotension and hypertension versus normotension than several traditional vascular risk factors. Moreover, CIMT was the only factor that correlated significantly with all the traditional cardiovascular risk factors assessed, bilaterally, in the study population.

The study's findings, which included a large sample size of 456 subjects, demonstrate that CIMT can be a useful surrogate marker of cardiovascular risk among black Africans. The significant correlations between CIMT and traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as age, gender, blood pressure, and fasting plasma glucose, support its potential as an indicator of cardiovascular risk.",Success
Delayed diagnosis of anorectal malformations: are current guidelines sufficient?,no,"No, the current guidelines are not sufficient.

The evidence confirms that despite following current guidelines, a significant proportion of infants with anorectal malformations (ARM) are diagnosed late, with 32% of patients in the second cohort and 19 patients over 7.5 years having a delayed diagnosis. Research shows that a delayed diagnosis is associated with a higher likelihood of presenting with obstructive symptoms, such as abdominal distension and delayed passage of meconium or stool. Moreover, 12 patients overall had their diagnosis missed despite undergoing neonatal examination, highlighting the need for improvement in current guidelines.",Success
Is being small for gestational age a risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity?,no,"No, being small for gestational age (SGA) is not a significant risk factor for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in preterm infants.

The evidence confirms that the prevalence of ROP in SGA infants (24.7%) was not significantly different from that in AGA infants (33.2%) (p = 0.111). Additionally, the prevalence of severe ROP requiring treatment was also similar between the two groups (6.2% in SGA vs. 7.5% in AGA, p = 0.779). The adjusted logistic regression analysis identified weight gain from birth to the sixth week of life and the need for blood transfusions as significant risk factors for ROP, but being SGA was not a significant predictor.",Success
Comparative safety of infliximab and etanercept on the risk of serious infections: does the association vary by patient characteristics?,yes,"Yes, the association between infliximab and the risk of serious infections compared to etanercept varies by age. 

The evidence confirms that patients under 65 years old who initiated infliximab had a significantly higher risk of serious infections, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 3.01 (95% CI: 1.49, 6.07), whereas patients 65 years or older did not show a significant difference in risk between infliximab and etanercept, with an adjusted HR of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.41, 2.13). Notably, the study found no significant variation in the association by sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, or smoking status.",Success
Can magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy improve cancer detection in enlarged prostates?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy significantly improves cancer detection in enlarged prostates. Research shows that the overall detection rate of magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy is 55%, with a detection rate of 71.1% for prostates less than 40 cc, decreasing to 30.4% for glands 115 cc or greater. The inverse association between magnetic resonance imaging volume and prostate cancer detection, controlling for age and prostate specific antigen, further supports the effectiveness of this approach in enlarged prostates.",Success
Does normothermic normokalemic simultaneous antegrade/retrograde perfusion improve myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism for hypertrophied hearts?,no,"No, normothermic normokalemic simultaneous antegrade/retrograde perfusion (NNSP) does not improve myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism for hypertrophied hearts.

The evidence confirms that when the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) flow is reduced to 50% of its control level, NNSP results in a significant decrease in myocardial oxygenation and phosphocreatine, whereas NNAP does not show a significant change. Moreover, when LAD flow is further reduced to 20% of its control level, the decrease in myocardial oxygenation, adenosine triphosphate, and phosphocreatine, along with the increase in inorganic phosphate, is significantly greater during NNSP compared to NNAP. These findings suggest that NNSP does not provide a protective effect on myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism in hypertrophied hearts, especially during reduced coronary blood flow.",Success
Are there progressive brain changes in schizophrenia?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that patients with schizophrenia exhibit progressive brain changes over time, characterized by significant decreases in whole brain volume, gray matter, and specific regional volumes, as well as increases in lateral ventricular volume, compared to healthy control subjects.

Research shows that the annualized percentage volume changes in patients with schizophrenia are notable, with decreases of -0.07% for whole brain volume, -0.59% for whole brain gray matter, -0.32% for frontal white matter, -0.32% for parietal white matter, and -0.39% for temporal white matter. In contrast, bilateral lateral ventricles showed an increase of +0.36% per year.

These findings are based on a systematic review of 27 longitudinal volumetric studies, including 928 patients with schizophrenia and 867 healthy control subjects, with a follow-up period ranging from 1 to 10 years. The results provide strong evidence for progressive brain changes in schizophrenia, highlighting the importance of continued research into the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.",Success
Does concept mapping enhance learning outcome of nursing students?,yes,"YES, concept mapping enhances learning outcomes of nursing students.

The evidence confirms that the mean scores of cumulative tests were significantly higher in the group that engaged in concept map construction compared to the group that only took quizzes. This suggests that concept mapping has a positive impact on learning outcomes. Furthermore, the gradual increase in mean scores of developed maps during the eight sessions of intervention indicates a progressive improvement in learning outcomes.

Statistically, the study demonstrates a significant difference in mean scores between the two groups, with the concept mapping group outperforming the quiz-only group. This finding is reinforced by the consistent improvement in mean scores over the eight sessions, indicating a sustained learning effect.

While the study's crossover design and small sample size may be limitations, the results provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of concept mapping in enhancing learning outcomes among nursing students.",Success
Does histologic chorioamnionitis correspond to clinical chorioamnionitis?,yes,"Yes, histologic chorioamnionitis corresponds to clinical chorioamnionitis.

The evidence confirms that histologic chorioamnionitis is significantly associated with clinical indicators of maternal infection, including the use of antibiotics (p = 0.0095) and a higher mean white blood cell count (p = 0.018). Furthermore, the presence of one or more clinical indicators is significantly associated with the presence of histologic chorioamnionitis (p = 0.019). These findings suggest a strong correlation between histologic chorioamnionitis and clinical chorioamnionitis.",Success
Does sonographic needle guidance affect the clinical outcome of intraarticular injections?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that sonographic needle guidance significantly improves the clinical outcomes of intraarticular injections. Research shows that sonographic guidance results in a 58.5% reduction in absolute pain scores at the 2-week outcome, a 75% reduction in significant pain, and a 25.6% increase in the responder rate, all of which are statistically significant (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively). Additionally, sonography increases the detection of effusion by 200% and the volume of aspirated fluid by 337%. These findings demonstrate a clear benefit of sonographic needle guidance in improving clinical outcomes of intraarticular injections.",Success
Pancreas retransplantation:  a second chance for diabetic patients?,yes,"YES, pancreas retransplantation can be a second chance for diabetic patients.

The evidence confirms that pancreas retransplantation can be a viable option for type 1 diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft. The study shows that second pancreas survival rates are comparable to primary graft survival rates, with 71% survival at 1 year and 59% at 5 years, which is significantly better than the first pancreas survival rates (P=0.0008). Additionally, patient survival rates are excellent, with 89% survival at 5 years. Furthermore, pancreas retransplantation has no negative impact on kidney graft function and survival, with 100% survival at 5 years. These findings suggest that pancreas retransplantation can provide a second chance for diabetic patients who have lost their primary graft, offering improved survival rates and quality of life.",Success
Does the enteral feeding advancement affect short-term outcomes in very low birth weight infants?,yes,"YES, the enteral feeding advancement affects short-term outcomes in very low birth weight infants.

The evidence confirms that the rate of sepsis, particularly late-onset sepsis, is significantly higher in VLBW infants born in centers with slow advancement (SA) compared to those with rapid advancement (RA) (14.0% vs 20.4%, P = 0.002). Additionally, the use of central venous lines (48.6% vs 31.1%, P<0.001) and antibiotics (92.4% vs 77.7%, P<0.001) was more frequent in centers with SA. These findings suggest that the enteral feeding advancement regimen has a significant impact on short-term outcomes in VLBW infants.",Success
Does psychological distress predict disability?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that psychological distress is a significant predictor of disability due to common chronic disorders. Research shows that, after adjusting for age, sex, smoking, and body mass index, the highest quartile of psychological distress score is associated with increased relative risks (RR) of disability for various conditions, including myocardial infarction (RR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.17-4.69), depression (RR: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.09-5.72), neck-shoulder disorders (RR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.26-3.11), and unspecified low-back disorders (RR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.24-2.49). The overall RR for disability was 1.76 (95% CI: 1.44-2.14) in the highest quartile of psychological distress score compared to the lowest quartile.",Success
Does preloading with colloids prevent hemodynamic changes when neurosurgical patients are subsequently changed to the seated position?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that preloading with colloids (Haemaccel) 10 ml/Kg before positioning prevents hemodynamic changes during seated positioning in neurosurgical patients. 

Research shows that systolic blood pressure and central venous pressure (CVP) were significantly maintained in the study group compared to the control group at various time intervals (15, 20, 30 minutes for systolic blood pressure and 15, 25, 30 minutes for CVP) after positioning. This suggests that preloading with colloids helps to prevent hemodynamic changes during seated positioning. Notably, there were no significant changes in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate between the two groups.",Success
Is there a first night effect on sleep bruxism?,no,"NO, there is no first night effect on sleep bruxism in terms of RMMA episode index. However, the study found that the second night showed significantly higher burst index, bruxism time index, and mean burst duration, suggesting that some aspects of sleep bruxism may be influenced by the first night effect.

The evidence confirms that the RMMA episode index, a key measure of sleep bruxism, did not differ between the two nights. However, the study did find significant time and group interactions for some sleep variables, such as total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and stage transitions. Additionally, the study found that some patients in the low frequency group shifted to the moderate-high frequency group on the second night, suggesting that the first night effect may influence the severity of sleep bruxism in some individuals.",Success
Does menopausal transition affect the quality of life?,no,"No, the menopausal transition does not affect the quality of life. The evidence confirms that in this study, the menopausal transition did not influence the eight domains of the Short Form-36 in the multivariate regression model. Research shows that only vasomotor symptoms had an adverse influence on role limitation of emotion, but not the menopausal transition itself. This suggests that the quality of life is not significantly impacted by the transition from premenopause to perimenopause.",Success
Can clinicians use the PHQ-9 to assess depression in people with vision loss?,yes,"YES, clinicians can use the PHQ-9 to assess depression in people with vision loss.

The evidence confirms that the PHQ-9 possesses the essential psychometric characteristics to measure depressive symptoms in people with visual impairment. The study's results demonstrate that the PHQ-9 fits the Rasch model, indicating that it is a unidimensional measure with ordered thresholds, and has satisfactory precision (person separation reliability value of 0.80). Additionally, there was no evidence of differential item functioning based on visual disability, suggesting that the PHQ-9 is not biased towards individuals with vision loss. These findings support the construct validity of the PHQ-9 in this population.",Success
Preparing patients at high risk of falls for discharge home after rehabilitation: Do we meet the guidelines?,no,"No, the evidence suggests that we do not meet the guidelines for preparing patients at high risk of falls for discharge home after rehabilitation.

Research shows that only 18% (9 out of 50) of patients' discharge documentation correctly identified falls risk, indicating a significant gap in falls risk assessment and documentation. Furthermore, the audit revealed limited evidence of assessment for osteoporosis, footwear, and visual assessment, which are crucial risk factors for falls. Although patients received a median of 6.5 out of 16 possible fall prevention strategies, with common strategies including mobility, strength, and Personal Activity of Daily Living training, the overall implementation of strategies was inadequate.

The evidence confirms that there is room for improvement in preparing patients at high risk of falls for discharge home after rehabilitation, and a more comprehensive approach to falls risk assessment and management is necessary to meet the guidelines.",Success
Some aspects of social exclusion: do they influence suicide mortality?,yes,"YES, certain aspects of social exclusion influence suicide mortality.

The evidence confirms that both the 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion have a negative influence on suicide mortality rates among both males and females. Specifically, the study found that these dimensions are statistically significant in predicting suicide mortality, with the 'social/welfare' dimension having a stronger influence among females. This suggests that addressing social exclusion in these areas may be an important strategy for reducing suicide mortality.",Success
Does parity increase insulin resistance during pregnancy?,no,"YES, parity is related to decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity index (ISI(OGTT)) during pregnancy, indicating increased insulin resistance. The evidence confirms that by univariate analysis, parity is associated with decreased ISI(OGTT), particularly in women with parity >3. Specifically, the study found a linear relationship between parity and decreased ISI(OGTT) (P = 0.0034). However, it's essential to note that this relationship becomes non-significant after adjusting for age, pregestational body mass index (BMI), and weight gain, suggesting that these factors may confound the relationship between parity and insulin resistance.",Success
Is gastric cancer different in Korea and the United States?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that gastric cancer characteristics and prognoses differ between Korean and U.S. subjects. 

Research shows that in the Korean cohort, upper third gastric cancer (UTG) patients had more undifferentiated, diffuse type, and advanced stage cancers compared to lower third gastric cancer (LTG) and middle third gastric cancer (MTG) patients. In contrast, the U.S. cohort had a more even distribution of T stage among UTG, MTG, and LTG patients. 

Furthermore, the independent predictors of disease-specific survival (DSS) differed between the two cohorts. In the Korean cohort, T stage, tumor size, retrieved and positive lymph node counts, and age were independent predictors of DSS, whereas in the U.S. cohort, only T stage and positive lymph node count were independent predictors. Notably, tumor size significantly affected DSS in Korean UTG patients but not in U.S. UTG patients.",Success
Do we need imaging to diagnose appendicitis in children?,maybe,"NO, imaging is not always necessary to diagnose appendicitis in children.

The evidence confirms that in this study, 82.4% of children who underwent appendectomy did not have preoperative imaging, suggesting that clinical assessment can be sufficient for diagnosis. Additionally, the study found that imaging was requested more frequently in children who did not undergo surgery, implying that clinical evaluation can accurately rule out appendicitis in many cases.

Notably, the negative appendectomy rate in this study was 8.8%, which is relatively low, indicating that clinical assessment can accurately diagnose appendicitis in most cases. However, it is essential to acknowledge that the study also found that females older than 10 years had a higher rate of histologically not-confirmed appendicitis (22.2%), highlighting the need for careful evaluation in this subgroup.

While imaging can be useful in certain cases, such as when the diagnosis is uncertain or in older females, the study suggests that selective use of imaging studies can be effective in managing suspected acute appendicitis in children.",Success
Does oral α-galactosidase relieve irritable bowel symptoms?,no,"Yes, oral α-galactosidase (AG) shows a trend towards relieving irritable bowel symptoms, particularly abdominal bloating and flatulence, in IBS patients. 

The evidence confirms that AG supplementation resulted in a higher responder rate at week 16, indicating a more prominent decrease in IBS-Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS) compared to the placebo group. Specifically, 18 patients in the AG group and 7 patients in the placebo group withdrew from the study due to improved symptoms (p = 0.016). Although the study did not detect a significant difference in quality of life between the AG and placebo groups, the findings suggest that AG may be beneficial in reducing IBS symptoms, particularly abdominal bloating and flatulence.",Success
Does cognitive function predict frequency compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition?,no,"No, cognitive function does not predict frequency compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition.

The evidence confirms that there was no statistically significant relationship between speech recognition and cognition for the frequency-compressed conditions (2:1 and 3:1 compression ratios). In contrast, a significant relationship was found for the unprocessed condition. This suggests that cognitive function is not a reliable predictor of frequency compressed speech recognition in individuals with normal hearing and normal cognition.",Success
Affect-regulated exercise intensity: does training at an intensity that feels 'good' improve physical health?,yes,"YES, training at an intensity that feels 'good' can improve physical health.

The evidence confirms that affect-regulated exercise training leads to improved fitness, as demonstrated by the significant increase in time to reach ventilatory threshold in the training group compared to the control group. Specifically, the training group showed an average increase of 70 seconds in time to reach ventilatory threshold, indicating improved cardiovascular fitness. Notably, the training group exercised at intensities that were within the lower range of the recommended guidelines for cardiovascular health, which is approximately 50% V˙O(2) max. The high compliance rate (>92%) suggests that this approach can support exercise adherence, leading to improved physical health outcomes.",Success
Women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary: do they have Lynch syndrome?,maybe,"YES. 

The evidence confirms that women with synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary have a significant likelihood of having Lynch syndrome. In this study, 7 out of 59 patients (11.9%) with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers had molecular findings consistent with a germline mutation of MSH2 or MLH1, which are characteristic of Lynch syndrome. Notably, all of these patients were classified as high- or medium-risk based on their family history. This suggests that women with synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancers, particularly those with a family history of HNPCC-associated cancers, should undergo molecular evaluation to determine their risk of having Lynch syndrome.",Success
Contrast-enhanced MR imaging of hand and finger joints in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis: do we really need a full dose of gadobenate dimeglumine for assessing synovial enhancement at 3 T?,no,"No, the evidence suggests that a full dose of gadobenate dimeglumine may not be necessary for assessing synovial enhancement in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis.

Research shows that there was no significant difference in the Rheumatoid Arthritis MRI Score (RAMRIS) or tenosynovitis scores between half-dose and full-dose images (P = 1), indicating that the diagnostic value of half-dose gadobenate dimeglumine is comparable to that of full-dose gadobenate dimeglumine in assessing synovitis or tenosynovitis in the wrist and finger joints. Although there was a significant difference in signal intensity between half-dose and full-dose gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced synovial tissue (P < .001), the high correlation between the ratio at half dose and full dose (r = 0.875) suggests that the half-dose images can be converted to full-dose equivalent values using a formula. This finding has important implications for reducing the amount of contrast agent used in MR imaging, which can minimize potential risks and side effects.",Success
Does laparoscopic cholecystectomy influence peri-sinusoidal cell activity?,yes,"YES, laparoscopic cholecystectomy influences peri-sinusoidal cell activity.

The evidence confirms that laparoscopic cholecystectomy affects peri-sinusoidal cell function, as demonstrated by the significant increase in serum hyaluronic acid (HA) levels in the study group. HA is a marker of peri-sinusoidal cell activity, and its elevation suggests that the procedure has an impact on these cells. Additionally, the study found that post-operative AST and ALT serum levels increased significantly only in the study group, further supporting the notion that laparoscopic cholecystectomy influences peri-sinusoidal cell activity.

Notably, the control group, which underwent other laparoscopic procedures not involving the hepatobiliary system, also showed an increase in HA serum levels, suggesting that the laparoscopic procedure may have a systemic effect on peri-sinusoidal cells. However, the more pronounced effect in the study group, combined with the increase in AST and ALT levels, indicates that the cholecystectomy itself has a specific impact on peri-sinusoidal cell activity.",Success
Risky sexual behavior among college students With ADHD: is the mother-child relationship protective?,yes,"Yes, the mother-child relationship is protective against risky sexual behavior among college students with ADHD, but only in specific circumstances.

The evidence confirms that a high-quality mother-child relationship is associated with a lower number of past-year sexual partners among college students with ADHD. This interaction between ADHD and mother-child relationship quality accounted for significant variance in the number of past-year sexual partners, suggesting that a positive mother-child relationship can mitigate the risk of engaging in risky sexual behavior for students with ADHD.

Notably, this protective effect was only observed among students with ADHD and not among those without ADHD. This finding highlights the importance of considering the complex interplay between ADHD and environmental factors, such as mother-child relationship quality, in understanding risky sexual behavior among college students.

It is essential to acknowledge that this study's findings are limited to a specific sample of undergraduates and may not be generalizable to other populations. However, the results suggest that targeting mother-child relationship quality may be a valuable strategy for reducing risky sexual behavior among college students with ADHD.",Success
Rotator cuff tear--an occupational disease?,yes,"YES, the evidence suggests that rotator cuff tears can be considered an occupational disease.

Research shows that in a retrospective study of 760 open rotator cuff repairs, a significant association was found between certain occupations and the development of rotator cuff disease. Specifically, males working in agriculture and forestry, as well as the building industry, had a higher incidence of rotator cuff repairs compared to the general population in Bavaria (6.38% vs 1.07% and 35.11% vs 13.40%, respectively, p<0.001). This suggests that the physical demands and occupational loads associated with these professions may contribute to the development of rotator cuff tears.",Success
Prognostic factors for cervical spondylotic amyotrophy: are signs of spinal cord involvement associated with the neurological prognosis?,yes,"YES, signs of spinal cord involvement are associated with the neurological prognosis of cervical spondylotic amyotrophy.

The evidence confirms that the presence of T2 high signal intensity areas (T2 HIA) on MRI and the number of T2 HIA are significantly associated with a poorer recovery of muscle strength (P=0.002). Additionally, the presence of the pyramidal tract sign is also significantly associated with a poor recovery at the final follow-up after surgery (P=0.043). These findings suggest that signs of spinal cord involvement, as indicated by MRI and clinical examination, are important prognostic factors for cervical spondylotic amyotrophy.",Success
Parasacral sciatic nerve block: does the elicited motor response predict the success rate?,maybe,"YES, the elicited motor response predicts the success rate of parasacral sciatic nerve block.

The evidence confirms that the success rate of complete block was significantly higher in the tibial group (11 of 14, 79%) compared to the peroneal group (2 of 12, 17%) with a P-value of 0.002. This suggests that the elicited motor response, specifically the tibial response, is a strong predictor of the success rate of parasacral sciatic nerve block.",Success
Ovarian torsion in children: is oophorectomy necessary?,no,"No, oophorectomy is not necessary in all cases of ovarian torsion in children.

The evidence confirms that detorsion alone can be a viable treatment option for ovarian torsion in children. In this study, 53% of the detorsion cases had ovaries that were judged to be moderately to severely ischemic intraoperatively, yet follow-up sonograms or ovarian biopsies showed normal ovaries with follicular development in all 14 cases where data was available. This suggests that the ovary can recover even when it appears severely damaged. Furthermore, the study found no significant difference in postoperative complications and length of stay between the detorsion and oophorectomy groups. These findings support the idea that detorsion alone can be a safe and effective treatment option for ovarian torsion in children, and oophorectomy may not be necessary in all cases.",Success
Does aerobic fitness influence microvascular function in healthy adults at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes?,maybe,"YES. The evidence confirms that aerobic fitness is positively correlated with microvascular function in healthy adults at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Research shows that in the 'at-risk' group, there is a significant positive correlation between maximal oxygen uptake (aerobic fitness) and maximum hyperaemia (r = 0.52, P = 0.006 l/min and r = 0.60, P = 0.001 ml/kg/min), as well as the peak response to acetylcholine (r = 0.40, P = 0.04 l/min and r = 0.47, P = 0.013 ml/kg/min). This suggests that higher aerobic fitness is associated with improved microvascular function in individuals at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.",Success
Nutritional assessment of gluten-free diet. Is gluten-free diet deficient in some nutrient?,yes,"Yes, the gluten-free diet can be deficient in some nutrients.

The evidence confirms that a gluten-free diet can lead to a deficient intake of certain nutrients, particularly vitamin D. In this study, a deficient intake of vitamin D was found in both the gluten-containing diet and the gluten-free diet. However, it's worth noting that the gluten-free diet showed an improvement in vitamin D levels after one year.

Additionally, the study found that the gluten-free diet was associated with a decrease in saturated fatty acids and an increase in monounsaturated fatty acids, as well as an increase in phosphorus intake. These changes may have positive effects on overall health.

It's essential to emphasize that a gluten-free diet can be nutritionally adequate if properly planned and monitored. However, it's crucial to be aware of the potential for nutrient deficiencies, particularly vitamin D, and take steps to ensure adequate intake.",Success
Standardizing care in medical oncology: are Web-based systems the answer?,maybe,"YES, Web-based systems can play a significant role in standardizing care in medical oncology.

The evidence confirms that Web-based systems can guide oncology treatment across multiple sites, promoting standardization of care. Research shows that these systems can be effective in improving patient outcomes, but their uptake and use are influenced by various factors, including clinician-specific and environmental factors. For instance, the study found that clinician autonomy, perceived lack of time, hospital policy, and infrastructure availability impact the adoption and use of Web-based systems. Moreover, education and training on the system are crucial for its ongoing use.

Notably, the study observed varying levels of system use across different hospital locations, clinician roles, and experience levels, highlighting the need for a comprehensive approach to implementing and promoting Web-based systems in medical oncology. While Web-based systems are not a panacea, they can be a valuable tool in standardizing care, and addressing the identified factors can optimize their effectiveness.",Success
Is ankle/arm pressure predictive for cardiovascular mortality in older patients living in nursing homes?,no,"No, the ankle/arm pressure index (AAI) is not predictive of cardiovascular mortality in older patients living in nursing homes.

The evidence confirms that in this longitudinal descriptive study, the presence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) diagnosed using AAI <0.90 was not related to total mortality or mortality due to ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease, or other causes. Specifically, the study found that IHD mortality was significantly and independently related to low hemoglobin values, previous cerebrovascular disease, polypharmacy, and poor mobility conditions, but not to AAI or PAD diagnosis.",Success
The objective structured clinical examination: can physician-examiners participate from a distance?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that remote physician-examiners can replace on-site physician-examiners in an OSCE, with statistically significant correlations found between local and remote examiner scores in history taking, physical examination, and management stations. Specifically, correlations ranged from 0.41 to 0.80, indicating a strong association between scores. While correlations for global ratings were more varied, three out of six stations reached significance. Furthermore, qualitative analysis showed high acceptance of the reOSCE among remote examiners and students, despite some technological issues.",Success
CPAP therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and obstructive sleep apnea: does it offer a better quality of life and sleep?,maybe,"Yes, CPAP therapy in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) offers a better quality of life and sleep.

The evidence confirms that CPAP therapy leads to a statistically significant improvement in the Functional Outcomes in Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) at 1, 3, and 6 months after CPAP initiation, indicating enhanced sleep quality and overall life quality parameters. Although not statistically significant, improvements were also noted in other parameters such as Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), SF-36 quality of life questionnaire, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).

Notably, two patients experienced difficulties with CPAP compliance due to nocturnal cough, claustrophobia, and insomnia, highlighting the importance of addressing these issues to ensure successful CPAP therapy. The addition of heated humidification helped alleviate the common complaint of disabling nocturnal cough.

While this study has limitations due to its small sample size, the findings suggest that CPAP therapy can be beneficial for IPF patients with OSA, improving their sleep and overall quality of life. Further investigation is warranted to confirm these results and explore strategies to overcome challenges in CPAP initiation and acceptance in this patient population.",Success
Proliferative index obtained by DNA image cytometry. Does it add prognostic information in Auer IV breast cancer?,yes,"Yes, the proliferative index obtained by DNA image cytometry adds prognostic information in Auer IV breast cancer.

The evidence confirms that the S + G2/M fraction, a measure of proliferative index, is a significant prognostic determinant in Auer IV breast cancers, particularly after the median time to relapse (1.5 years) and median time until death (three years). Research shows that tumors with a low S + G2/M fraction are associated with better recurrence-free survival and overall survival outcomes, and are more likely to be smaller and hormone receptor-positive. Specifically, the study found that the S + G2/M fraction was statistically significant in both univariate and multivariate analysis for recurrence-free survival and overall survival after the median time points.",Success
Does skin care frequency affect the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis in critically ill patients?,yes,"YES, skin care frequency affects the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis in critically ill patients.

The evidence confirms that increasing the frequency of skin care protocol from every 12 hours to every 6 hours significantly reduces the severity of incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) in critically ill patients. In this 9-month randomized prospective study, the intervention group receiving the skin care protocol every 6 hours had a significantly lower dermatitis score (7.1%) compared to the control group receiving the protocol every 12 hours (10.9%), with a P value ≤ 0.001. This suggests that more frequent skin care interventions can lead to improved skin health and reduced severity of IAD in this patient population.",Success
Do resident's leadership skills relate to ratings of technical skill?,yes,"Yes, the study suggests that residents' leadership skills, as measured by the number of directional instructions given to their assistant, relate to their ratings of technical skill.

The evidence confirms that residents who rated lower levels of decay in their intraoperative decision-making and small bowel repair skills gave more instructions to their assistant, indicating stronger leadership skills. Furthermore, a higher number of instructions correlated with lower perceived difficulty in selecting the correct suture, suture pattern, and completing the entire surgical task. This suggests that residents with higher technical skill ratings, as reflected in their self-efficacy measures, demonstrated better leadership skills during the simulated small bowel repair.

Statistically, the study found a significant correlation between the number of directional instructions and participants' perceptions of self-efficacy measures, including expected skills decay, task difficulty, and confidence in addressing the small bowel injury. This correlation suggests that residents' leadership skills, as measured by their ability to direct their assistant, are related to their technical skill ratings.",Success
The FOOTSTEP self-management foot care programme: are rheumatoid arthritis patients physically able to participate?,maybe,"No, not all rheumatoid arthritis patients are physically able to participate in the FOOTSTEP self-management foot care programme. 

The evidence confirms that only 57% of RA patients passed all the physical tests required for participation in the programme, indicating that a significant proportion of patients may not be physically capable of undertaking self-managed foot care. Specifically, 23% failed the reach test, and 33% failed the grip strength test. Although patients who failed the physical tests had higher physical disability, pain, and general health scores, these differences were not statistically significant.",Success
CYP2D6*4 allele and breast cancer risk: is there any association?,yes,"YES, the presence of the CYP2D6*4 allele is associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer.

The evidence confirms that in the studied Spanish population, the frequency of the homozygous CYP2D6*4 allele was significantly lower in breast cancer patients compared to the control group, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.22 and a p-value of 0.04. This suggests that the presence of the CYP2D6*4 allele may decrease susceptibility to breast carcinoma.",Success
Does base deficit predict mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury?,no,"No, the evidence suggests that base deficit does not predict mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.

Research shows that in this retrospective observational study, there was no statistically significant difference in means of base deficit between survivors and non-survivors, and the area under the receiver operator curve (ROC) for base deficit as a predictor of mortality was statistically non-significant. This indicates that base deficit is not a reliable predictor of mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury.",Success
Cancer of the buccal mucosa: are margins and T-stage accurate predictors of local control?,no,"NO, margins and T-stage are not accurate predictors of local control in cancer of the buccal mucosa.

The evidence confirms that, despite a significant effort to achieve negative margins, the local failure rate remained high, with 52% of patients experiencing local recurrence even with negative margins. Furthermore, the study found no statistically significant difference in local failure rates between patients with close or positive margins and those with negative margins (P = ns). Additionally, among patients with T1-T2 disease who achieved negative margins, the local failure rate was still 40%. These findings suggest that margin status and T-stage are not reliable predictors of local control in buccal mucosa cancer.",Success
Can mass drug administration lead to the sustainable control of schistosomiasis?,no,"No, the evidence suggests that mass drug administration (MDA) alone may not be sufficient for sustainable control of schistosomiasis.

Research shows that despite an active schistosomiasis-control program in Northern Samar for over 30 years, including a MDA campaign in the last 5 years, the mean prevalence of schistosomiasis remained high at 27.1% (95% CI, 26.3%-28.0%). This indicates that MDA alone may not be enough to achieve sustainable control of the disease. Additionally, the study found high levels of schistosomiasis-induced morbidity, including liver enlargement, fibrosis, and splenomegaly, which suggests that MDA may not be effectively reducing the disease burden.

It is essential to consider that MDA may need to be combined with other control strategies, such as improved sanitation, hygiene, and snail control, to achieve sustainable control of schistosomiasis. Further investigation is necessary to determine the most effective combination of interventions for sustainable control of the disease.",Success
Can D-dimer become a new diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis?,no,"NO, D-dimer serum level cannot be used as a diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis.

The evidence confirms that there was no statistically significant difference in D-dimer levels between histopathologic study groups (P>.05), indicating that D-dimer levels do not correlate with the presence or severity of acute appendicitis. This finding suggests that D-dimer is not a reliable diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis.

Research shows that other diagnostic parameters, such as Alvarado scores and leukocyte counts, were also not significantly correlated with D-dimer levels, further supporting the conclusion that D-dimer is not a useful diagnostic tool for acute appendicitis.

It is essential to note that this study had a small sample size (49 patients) and may not be representative of the general population. However, the lack of correlation between D-dimer levels and acute appendicitis in this study suggests that D-dimer is unlikely to be a reliable diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis. Further investigation is needed to confirm these findings and explore alternative diagnostic approaches.",Success
Is there a relationship between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease?,yes,"YES, there is a relationship between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease.

The evidence confirms that individuals referred for periodontal treatment have a significantly higher prevalence of self-reported rheumatoid arthritis (3.95%) compared to those not referred for periodontal treatment (0.66%) and the general population (1%). Furthermore, 62.5% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were referred for periodontal treatment had advanced forms of periodontal disease. This suggests a strong association between the two conditions.",Success
Does telmisartan prevent hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes?,yes,"Yes, telmisartan prevents hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes.

The evidence confirms that telmisartan significantly reduces the numerical density of hepatocytes and eliminates immunoreactivity to TGF-beta in the livers of diabetic rats. Research shows that TGF-beta is a key mediator of hepatic fibrosis, and the absence of immunoreactivity in the telmisartan-treated group suggests that telmisartan inhibits the fibrotic process. This study's findings strongly imply that telmisartan has a protective effect against diabetes-related hepatic degeneration and fibrosis in rats.",Success
Is there a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that there is a discrepancy between patient and physician quality of life assessment. Research shows that the weighted kappa analysis revealed relatively poor concordance between patient and physician responses, with a mean kappa of 0.33, indicating a significant difference in their assessments. Specifically, physicians underestimated quality of life scores in 4 out of 9 domains by a mean of 5.5% and overestimated scores in 5 out of 9 domains by a mean of 6.9%. Notably, physicians significantly underestimated the impact of lower urinary tract symptoms on social limitations and emotions (P<0.05).",Success
Does quilting suture prevent seroma in abdominoplasty?,yes,"Yes, the evidence suggests that quilting suture can prevent seroma in abdominoplasty.

Research shows that in this study, the average fluid collection found was 8.2 cc per patient, which is a relatively small amount, indicating that quilting suture may have been effective in reducing the incidence of seroma. Furthermore, only two patients required aspiration, and they did not experience recurrence of seroma after the procedure. This suggests that quilting suture may have played a role in preventing seroma in these patients.

It's worth noting that the study population was selected based on characteristics that increase the risk of seroma, such as high body mass index, significant weight loss, previous incision in the supraumbilical region, or thinning of the subcutaneous tissue above the umbilicus. Despite these risk factors, the incidence of seroma was relatively low, which further supports the efficacy of quilting suture in preventing seroma.

While this study has limitations, including a small sample size, the results suggest that quilting suture may be a useful technique in reducing the risk of seroma in abdominoplasty. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish the long-term efficacy of quilting suture in preventing seroma.",Success
Does feeding tube insertion and its timing improve survival?,no,"NO, feeding tube insertion and its timing do not improve survival.

The evidence confirms that, after correcting for selection bias, there was no significant difference in survival between nursing home residents with advanced cognitive impairment who received a feeding tube and those who did not (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.94-1.13). Additionally, the timing of feeding tube insertion, whether within 1 month or later (4 months), did not affect survival (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.86-1.20). These findings suggest that feeding tube insertion and its timing do not have a significant impact on survival in this population.",Success
Does prostate morphology affect outcomes after holmium laser enucleation?,yes,"Yes, prostate morphology affects outcomes after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate. 

The evidence confirms that patients with trilobar prostate morphology experience a significantly greater decrease in postvoid residual (PVR) urine volume compared to those with bilobar morphology (296 vs 176 mL, P = .01). This difference persists even after controlling for other factors in multivariate analysis. While there were no significant differences in other postoperative outcomes, such as symptom scores, maximal flow rate, and complication rates, the impact on PVR urine volume suggests that prostate morphology does influence outcomes.",Success
Are patients with serious mental illness more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more deficiencies in care?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that patients with serious mental illness, specifically those with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, are more likely to be admitted to nursing homes with more deficiencies in care. Research shows that compared to other patients, those with schizophrenia tend to enter nursing homes with 13.3 total deficiencies and 8.6 healthcare-related deficiencies, whereas patients with bipolar disorder enter facilities with 12.5 total deficiencies and 8.2 healthcare-related deficiencies. These findings persist even after controlling for patient characteristics, facility covariates, and within-county choice of facilities.",Success
Does an additional antirotation U-Blade (RC) lag screw improve treatment of AO/OTA 31 A1-3 fractures with gamma 3 nail?,no,"No, the evidence suggests that the additional antirotation U-Blade (RC) lag screw does not improve treatment of AO/OTA 31 A1-3 fractures with gamma 3 nail in terms of reducing the cut-out rate. Research shows that the cut-out rate was 2.2% in the U-Blade (RC) lag screw group (n=3) compared to 3.7% in the standard lag screw group (n=5), but this difference was not statistically significant.",Success
May mean platelet volume levels be a predictor in the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease?,yes,"YES, the evidence confirms that mean platelet volume (MPV) levels may be a predictor in the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). 

Research shows that MPV values in patients with PID were significantly lower than those in the control group (p < 0.001), indicating a potential association between MPV and PID. Furthermore, the receiver-operating curve analysis revealed that MPV has a greater area under the curve value compared to other hematological parameters, suggesting its potential as a diagnostic marker. Specifically, the area under the curve value for MPV was 0.73, which is higher than neutrophil rate (0.64), leukocyte count (0.72), and platelet count (0.49). This finding supports the notion that MPV may be a useful predictor in the diagnosis of PID.",Success
Are head and neck specific quality of life measures necessary?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that head and neck-specific quality of life measures are necessary. Research shows that head and neck-specific measures, such as the Head and Neck Survey (H&NS), are more strongly correlated with specific head and neck domains (e.g., eating/swallowing, speech/communication) than with general health measures. This suggests that general health measures do not fully capture the unique aspects of head and neck cancer patients' quality of life. Specifically, the study found that eating/swallowing and speech/communication were not well correlated with general health domains, indicating that these aspects of quality of life require specific measurement. While some correlations were found between head and neck pain and general bodily pain, the appearance domain was not fully reflected by any other domain, further supporting the need for head and neck-specific measures.",Success
Could chest wall rigidity be a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse?,yes,"YES, chest wall rigidity could be a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse. 

The evidence confirms that the lack of measurable norfentanyl in half of the cases suggests a very rapid death, consistent with acute chest rigidity. Additionally, the presence of strikingly high fentanyl concentrations with no norfentanyl detected in several cases further supports this conclusion. Research shows that acute chest wall rigidity is a well-recognized complication in the medical community, which may be unknown to the drug abuse community, increasing the risk of rapid death. The study's findings of deaths occurring with low levels of fentanyl in the therapeutic range (1-2 ng/ml) in apparent non-naïve opiate abusers also support the potential role of chest wall rigidity in rapid death.",Success
Is severe pain immediately after spinal augmentation a predictor of long-term outcomes?,no,"No, severe pain immediately after vertebroplasty is not a predictor of long-term pain relief outcomes.

The evidence confirms that patients experiencing severe pain immediately after vertebroplasty had similar pain severity and analgesic usage at 1 month and 1 year postprocedure compared to those who did not experience severe pain. Specifically, the study found no significant differences in VAS rest and activity pain scores between the severe pain group and the nonsevere pain group at 1 month (P = .16 and P = .25, respectively) and 1 year (P values not reported, but stated to be similar) postprocedure. Additionally, analgesic usage was similar among all groups at 1 year postprocedure. These findings suggest that severe pain immediately after vertebroplasty does not predict long-term pain relief outcomes.",Success
Can computerised tomography replace bone scintigraphy in detecting bone metastases from breast cancer?,yes,"YES, computerized tomography (CT) can replace bone scintigraphy (BS) in detecting bone metastases from breast cancer.

The evidence confirms that CT detected metastatic bone lesions in 98% of patients with bone metastases, with only one patient having a solitary, asymptomatic bony metastasis in the shaft of the femur that was not detected by CT. In contrast, BS was positive in all patients with bone metastases, but had 11 false-positive findings. This suggests that CT is a reliable alternative to BS for detecting bone metastases in breast cancer patients.",Success
Does obesity impact the pattern and outcome of trauma in children?,no,"Yes. The evidence confirms that obesity has a significant impact on the pattern and outcome of trauma in children. 

Research shows that obese children in this study had a higher injury severity score, lower pediatric trauma score, and were more likely to have rib fractures and pelvic injuries compared to non-obese children. Specifically, the study found that obese children were more likely to have rib fractures (P = .02) and pelvic injuries (P = .033). 

While there was no significant association between mortality and obesity in this study (P = .42), the findings suggest that obesity is associated with more severe injuries and a different pattern of injury in children. This highlights the importance of considering obesity as a factor in the management and treatment of injured children.",Success
Is (18)F-FDG a surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia?,no,"No, (18)F-FDG is not a reliable surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia.

The evidence confirms that the study's results show a low dice similarity index (DSI) between (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG, indicating a poor correlation between the two tracers in detecting hypoxia. Under normoxic conditions, the DSI was 0.24 and 0.20 for FSAII and SCCVII tumors, respectively, and under hypoxic conditions, the DSI was 0.36 for SCCVII tumors. These values suggest that (18)F-FDG does not accurately reflect tumor hypoxia.

Research shows that the uptake of (18)F-FDG is not specific to hypoxia and can be influenced by other factors, such as glucose metabolism and inflammation. The study's findings support the idea that (18)F-FDG is not a reliable surrogate marker for tumor hypoxia, and other tracers, such as (14)C-EF3, may be more suitable for this purpose.",Success
Are 99mTc leukocyte scintigraphy and SBFT studies useful in children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease?,yes,"Yes, 99mTc leukocyte scintigraphy and SBFT studies are useful in children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease.

The evidence confirms that 99mTc-WBC scintigraphy has a high sensitivity in detecting inflammation in children with IBD, with a true-positive rate of 93% (46/49) in this study. Moreover, the study shows that 81% of children with a true-positive 99mTc-WBC scan had normal UGI-SBFT studies, highlighting the value of 99mTc-WBC scintigraphy in detecting inflammation even when SBFT studies are normal. Additionally, the 99mTc-WBC scan correctly predicted the presence of inflammation in the terminal ileum in 5 children with equivocal UGI-SBFT studies. These findings suggest that 99mTc leukocyte scintigraphy and SBFT studies can be useful tools in the diagnostic workup of children suspected of having IBD.",Success
Prostate bed target interfractional motion using RTOG consensus definitions and daily CT on rails : Does target motion differ between superior and inferior portions of the clinical target volume?,no,"NO, target motion does not differ between superior and inferior portions of the clinical target volume.

The evidence confirms that the study found no statistically significant differences between the inferior PB-CTV (INF-CTV) and superior PB-CTV (SUP-CTV) motion in any direction (left-right, superoinferior, and anteroposterior). The mean target motion values for INF-CTV and SUP-CTV were similar, with standard deviations indicating minimal variability. Specifically, the mean target motion values for INF-CTV were 0.1 (±2.8), 0.5 (±2.2), and 0.2 (±2.5) mm, and for SUP-CTV were 0.3 (±1.8), 0.5 (±2.3), and 0 (±5.0) mm in the LR, SI, and AP directions, respectively.",Success
Esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy in portal hypertension: safe and effective?,yes,"YES. 

The evidence confirms that esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy (EDWS) is a safe and effective treatment for portal hypertension. In this study, EDWS demonstrated a significant reduction in portal venous pressure, similar to the modified esophagogastric devascularization (MED) with splenectomy. Notably, the morbidity rate of portal venous system thrombosis was significantly lower in the EDWS group compared to the MED group (P=0.032). Furthermore, the 1- and 3-year recurrence rates of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage were 0% and 4.5%, respectively, in the EDWS group, which is comparable to the MED group. These findings suggest that EDWS is a viable treatment option for portal hypertension, offering a safer and equally effective alternative to MED with splenectomy.",Success
Does maternal obesity have an influence on feeding behavior of obese children?,no,"Yes, maternal obesity has an influence on feeding behavior of obese children.

The evidence confirms that there is a direct correlation between children's BMI and their mothers' BMI, suggesting that maternal obesity plays a role in the development of obesity in children. Furthermore, the study found that mothers' personal weight perception, concern for child's weight, and restriction are positively correlated with their child's BMI-SDS, indicating that maternal obesity influences feeding behaviors that contribute to childhood obesity.

Specifically, the study found that mothers' personal weight perception, concern for child's weight, and restriction are associated with higher BMI-SDS in children, even after adjusting for child's age. This suggests that obese mothers may engage in feeding practices that promote overeating or unhealthy eating habits in their children, contributing to the development of obesity.

It's worth noting that the study did not find significant differences in maternal feeding practices between obese and non-obese mothers, suggesting that other factors may also play a role in shaping feeding behaviors. However, the correlation between maternal obesity and child's BMI-SDS provides strong evidence for the influence of maternal obesity on feeding behavior in obese children.",Success
Should lower limb fractures be treated surgically in patients with chronic spinal injuries?,yes,"YES, lower limb fractures should be treated surgically in patients with chronic spinal cord injuries.

The evidence confirms that surgical treatment leads to better clinical results, improved range of motion, and enhanced bone consolidation compared to orthopedic treatment. Notably, surgical treatment also results in fewer pressure ulcers and radiological misalignments. While there is no significant difference in pain, hospital stay, and medical complications between the two groups, the benefits of surgical treatment in terms of functional outcomes and reduced complications outweigh the risks. 

Research shows that in this study, 25 surgically treated fractures had better outcomes compared to 12 orthopedically treated fractures. This suggests that surgical intervention can be a viable option for patients with chronic spinal cord injuries, contrary to the current trend of conservative treatment. 

It is essential to acknowledge that the study's findings may have limitations, and further research is needed to establish a consensus on the management of lower limb fractures in patients with chronic spinal cord injuries. However, based on the available evidence, surgical treatment appears to be a superior option for these patients.",Success
Does short-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors cause rebound aggravation of symptoms?,no,"NO, short-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors does not cause rebound aggravation of symptoms.

The evidence confirms that in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, there was no significant difference in symptom scores during the placebo period between the groups given lansoprazole first and placebo first. Specifically, the reflux, total, and antacid scores were not significantly higher in the group given lansoprazole first, indicating no rebound aggravation of symptoms. The study's findings suggest that short-term treatment with lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, does not lead to rebound acid hypersecretion or worsen symptoms after treatment cessation.",Success
Do family physicians make good sentinels for influenza?,yes,"YES. 

The evidence confirms that family physicians can make good sentinels for influenza. Research shows that in this study, physicians attributed 5% of office visits to ILI, and their reports of peak morbidity preceded those of state and territorial health departments in four of five seasons. Moreover, influenza virus isolates from sentinel physicians peaked 1 to 4 weeks earlier than those reported by World Health Organization laboratories. This suggests that family physicians can provide timely and valuable information on influenza activity.",Success
Is ganglionated plexi ablation during Maze IV procedure beneficial for postoperative long-term stable sinus rhythm?,no,"No, the evidence suggests that ganglionated plexi (GP) ablation during a Cox-Maze IV procedure does not have a significant impact on maintaining long-term stable sinus rhythm. Research shows that the absence of GP ablation was not a significant factor in predicting atrial fibrillation recurrence (p = 0.12). In contrast, other factors such as duration of AF ≥ 38 months, left atrial diameter ≥ 54 mm, left atrial area ≥ 33 cm(2), absence of connecting lesions, and absence of right atrial ablation were independently associated with a high incidence of AF recurrence.",Success
Scrotal approach to both palpable and impalpable undescended testes: should it become our first choice?,yes,"YES, the scrotal approach should become the first choice for both palpable and impalpable undescended testes.

The evidence confirms that a single scrotal incision orchidopexy is a valid approach for patients with palpable undescended testicles, and this study demonstrates its effectiveness in diagnosing and treating impalpable undescended testicles as well. The results show that 78% of impalpable testicles could be diagnosed and treated using only a scrotal incision, with a low conversion rate to laparoscopy (4 cases). Furthermore, the study reports a limited number of postoperative complications, and all testes were palpable and remained in the scrotum on follow-up.

Research shows that the scrotal approach allows for easy detection of atrophic testes or testicular remnants, making it a suitable initial surgical approach for both palpable and impalpable undescended testicles. With a success rate of 78% in diagnosing and treating impalpable testicles, the scrotal approach should be considered the first choice for managing undescended testes.",Success
Does the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia exist?,no,"No, the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia does not exist as a continuous, impenetrable barrier.

The evidence confirms that the fascial structures in the anterior cervical triangle do not form a single, continuous sheet that extends between the sternocleidomastoid muscles. Instead, the study found that the fascia of strap muscles and the fasciae of the submandibular glands form a dumbbell-like fascia sheet with free lateral margins, which does not continue with the sternocleidomastoid fascia. Additionally, in the lower cervical region, no single connective tissue sheet extends directly between the sternocleidomastoid muscles.

This study's findings suggest that the concept of an impenetrable investing layer of the deep cervical fascia may be an oversimplification, and that the fascial structures in the anterior cervical triangle are more complex and nuanced.",Success
Is prophylactic fixation a cost-effective method to prevent a future contralateral fragility hip fracture?,maybe,"Maybe. 

The evidence confirms that prophylactic fixation is not a cost-effective method to prevent contralateral hip fracture in all cases, specifically in 79-year-old women. However, research shows that it can be a cost-effective method in certain subgroups, such as women between 71-75 years old with a 30% greater relative risk of contralateral fracture and women younger than 70 years old. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic fixation is highly dependent on the additional costs of the procedure, with a threshold of $6000 or less. The success of prophylactic fixation is also sensitive to its effectiveness and the relative morbidity and mortality of the additional procedure.",Success
Is double-balloon enteroscopy an accurate method to diagnose small-bowel disorders?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) is an accurate method to diagnose small-bowel disorders, with a diagnostic yield of 75% (33/44 cases) in this study. Research shows that DBE successfully identified the source of bleeding in 75% of patients with occult or obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, and achieved a diagnosis in 75% of patients with other indications. The study's findings demonstrate the effectiveness of DBE in diagnosing a range of small-bowel disorders, including angiodysplasias, lymphomas, and polyposis syndromes.",Success
Is fetal anatomic assessment on follow-up antepartum sonograms clinically useful?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that fetal anatomic assessment on follow-up antepartum sonograms is clinically useful. Research shows that in this study, 7.1% of women who underwent follow-up sonograms had unanticipated fetal anomalies, with a higher incidence found in those who underwent sonography for fetal growth evaluation (12.3% vs 3.5%, P = .01). Furthermore, neonates whose mothers had sonographic examinations for fetal growth had a higher rate of neonatal interventions (40.0% vs 0%, P = .04). These findings suggest that performing full fetal anatomic surveys on follow-up sonograms can lead to the detection of unexpected fetal anomalies and potentially impact neonatal outcomes.",Success
Does coronary angiography before emergency aortic surgery affect in-hospital mortality?,no,"No, coronary angiography before emergency aortic surgery does not affect in-hospital mortality. The evidence confirms that in-hospital mortality rates were similar between patients who underwent coronary angiography on the day of surgery (22%) and those who did not (16%), with a p-value of 0.46, indicating no statistically significant difference. Additionally, multivariate analysis revealed that a history of myocardial infarction was the only predictor of in-hospital mortality, and coronary angiography had no impact on in-hospital mortality in patients with a history of MI.",Success
Target Serum Urate: Do Gout Patients Know Their Goal?,no,"No, most gout patients do not know their target serum urate (SU) goal. The evidence confirms that only 14% of patients in this study knew their SU goal, despite the majority answering correctly for other gout-specific knowledge questions. Research shows that having a rheumatologist as the initial prescriber and having knowledge of other gout-specific facts are associated with greater odds of knowing the SU goal.",Success
Are neighbourhood social capital and availability of sports facilities related to sports participation among Dutch adolescents?,maybe,"YES, neighbourhood social capital (NSC) is related to sports participation among Dutch adolescents, but the availability of sports facilities is not.

The evidence confirms that NSC has a significant association with sports participation, with an odds ratio of 3.51 (95% CI: 1.18; 10.41) after adjusting for potential confounders. This suggests that adolescents living in neighborhoods with higher social capital are more likely to engage in leisure time sports. On the other hand, the availability of sports facilities was not found to be associated with sports participation.

Notably, the study also found a significant interaction between NSC and the density of parks within the neighborhood area, indicating that the combination of high NSC and high park density is most conducive to sports participation among adolescents.",Success
Recurrent spontaneous abortion and skewed X-inactivation: is there an association?,no,"No, there is no association between recurrent spontaneous abortion and skewed X-inactivation. The evidence confirms that the rate of extreme skewing (90% or greater) in the recurrent spontaneous abortion population was 8.6%, which is not statistically different from any of the other groups, except the Primiparous group. Specifically, the incidence of X-inactivation skewing of 90% or greater was no different whether there had been at least 1 live birth or no previous live births and at least 3 losses.",Success
Doppler examination of uteroplacental circulation in early pregnancy: can it predict adverse outcome?,yes,"YES, Doppler examination of uteroplacental circulation in early pregnancy can predict adverse outcome.

The evidence confirms that spectral Doppler measurements obtained from bilateral uterine, arcuate, radial, and spiral arteries in early gestation correlate with adverse pregnancy outcome. Specifically, the study found that right uterine artery PI and RI values were significantly higher in women who developed adverse pregnancy outcomes. Additionally, GS-CRL difference, GS/CRL ratio, and yolk sac diameters were significantly lower in this group. These findings suggest that Doppler examination of uteroplacental circulation in early pregnancy can be a useful predictor of adverse outcome.",Success
Can vitamin C prevent complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures?,yes,"Yes, vitamin C can prevent complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures. The evidence confirms that vitamin C supplementation significantly reduces the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures. In this double-blind, prospective, multicenter trial, the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome was 2.4% in the vitamin C group, compared to 10.1% in the placebo group (p=0.002). Specifically, the relative risk of developing complex regional pain syndrome was 0.41, 0.17, and 0.17 for the 200-mg, 500-mg, and 1500-mg vitamin C groups, respectively, indicating a dose-response effect. Notably, early cast-related complaints were also a significant predictor of complex regional pain syndrome development.",Success
Are income-related differences in active travel associated with physical environmental characteristics?,no,"Yes, income-related differences in active travel are associated with physical environmental characteristics.

The evidence confirms that the likelihood of making an active trip varies by income group and physical environmental deprivation. Specifically, the study found that individuals in the highest income groups were less likely to choose active travel in areas with good physical environmental characteristics, whereas those in the lowest income group were unaffected by physical environmental deprivation.",Success
Can Roux-en-Y gastric bypass provide a lifelong solution for diabetes mellitus?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can provide a lifelong solution for diabetes mellitus, particularly for obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Research shows that gastric bypass has been highly effective in achieving long-term remission of diabetes, with studies demonstrating a significant reduction in HbA1c levels and improved insulin sensitivity.

According to a systematic review of 72 relevant studies, gastric bypass has been shown to result in a high rate of diabetes remission, with a mean follow-up period of 2-5 years. Specifically, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 78% of patients with type 2 diabetes achieved remission after gastric bypass surgery, with a mean follow-up period of 2 years.

While the current evidence is primarily based on studies involving obese patients with type 2 diabetes, the shared criteria between types 1 and 2 diabetes suggest that a selected spectrum of the disease may be a potential target for metabolic surgery, including gastric bypass. However, further research is needed to explore the potential benefits of gastric bypass for patients with type 1 diabetes.

It is essential to note that individual results may vary, and long-term follow-up is necessary to ensure the durability of the treatment. Nevertheless, the existing evidence strongly suggests that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can provide a lifelong solution for diabetes mellitus in many cases.",Success
"Do the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis?",yes,"YES, the changes in the serum levels of IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis.

The evidence confirms that the ratios of TNFalpha/IL-4 at 12 and 24 hours after ERCP were significantly higher in patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis, indicating an imbalance in the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine response. Additionally, IL-6 levels were significantly increased at 24 hours after ERCP in the complicated group, suggesting an amplified inflammatory response. These findings are consistent with the concept that cytokine changes contribute to the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis.

Notably, IL-2 levels did not show any significant changes between the groups, which may indicate that IL-2 is not a key player in the inflammatory response associated with post-ERCP pancreatitis. However, the study's findings on IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 provide valuable insights into the cytokine profile of patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis, highlighting the potential for these biomarkers to aid in early diagnosis and risk stratification.",Success
Is routine intraoperative frozen-section examination of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer worthwhile?,maybe,"Yes, routine intraoperative frozen-section examination of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer is worthwhile.

The evidence confirms that intraoperative frozen section (FS) can detect metastatic disease, allowing immediate axillary dissection and avoiding the need for reoperation. In this study, the sensitivity of FS ranged from 40% for patients with T1a to 76% for patients with T2 cancers, and FS was far more effective in detecting macrometastatic disease (sensitivity 92%) than micrometastases (sensitivity 17%). Notably, the benefit of FS in avoiding reoperative axillary dissection ranged from 4% for T1a (6 of 143) to 38% for T2 (45 of 119) cancers. While FS is costly and increases operative time, the benefits of avoiding reoperation and detecting metastatic disease outweigh these drawbacks.",Success
Can we predict urinary stone composition based on an analysis of microelement concentration in the hair and urine?,no,"No, based on the study, we cannot predict urinary stone composition based on an analysis of microelement concentration in the hair and urine.

The evidence confirms that only a few correlations were found between the composition of stones and the distribution of elements in urine and hair, and all were considered incidental. This suggests that there is no significant relationship between the microelement concentration in hair and urine and the composition of urinary stones. The study's findings do not support the use of hair and urine analysis to predict urinary stone composition.",Success
Does intra-abdominal desmoid disease affect patients with an ileal pouch differently than those with an ileorectal anastomosis?,no,"NO, the clinical effects of abdominal desmoids are not worse in patients with restorative proctocolectomy than in patients with ileorectal anastomosis.

The evidence confirms that the overall complication rate of desmoids, as well as the risk of individual complications, was similar between the two groups. Specifically, the study found that 69.4% of patients with restorative proctocolectomy and 65.6% of patients with ileorectal anastomosis underwent surgery for desmoid tumors, and 22.4% and 22.2% of patients ultimately had permanent stomas, respectively. These findings suggest that the type of surgery preceding the development of desmoids does not significantly impact the clinical course of the disease.

It is essential to acknowledge the study's limitation due to the relatively small sample size. However, the results provide valuable insights into the effects of desmoids on patients with different types of surgical interventions. Further investigation with larger cohorts would help to strengthen these findings and provide more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between desmoids and surgical interventions.",Success
Does anastomotic leakage affect functional outcome after rectal resection for cancer?,no,"No, anastomotic leakage does not significantly affect functional outcome after rectal resection for cancer.

The evidence confirms that the continence score, a measure of continence function, did not differ significantly between patients with anastomotic leakage and those without complications. Specifically, the study found that the continence score was similar in both groups, with no statistically significant difference. Additionally, sphincter function, maximum tolerable volume, and rectal compliance were also similar between the two groups, with only slight, non-significant worsenings in the leakage group. These findings suggest that anastomotic leakage does not have a significant impact on functional outcome after rectal resection for cancer.",Success
Health care for immigrants in Europe: is there still consensus among country experts about principles of good practice?,maybe,"Yes, there is still a broad European consensus among country experts about the principles of good practice in health care for immigrants.

The evidence confirms that despite local variations and discordance, the Delphi process identified 9 themes that were consistently rated as important across the 16 EU Member States. These themes, including easy and equal access to health care, empowerment of migrants, and culturally sensitive health care services, demonstrate a shared understanding of good practice principles among experts. While there were differences in the selection and rating of factors within and between countries, the consensus on most factors suggests a common foundation for good practice in health care for immigrants across Europe.",Success
Is there awareness of pharmaceutical expenditure in the reformed primary care system?,no,"No, there is no awareness of pharmaceutical expenditure in the reformed primary care system.

The evidence confirms that significant differences were found between the actual annual pharmaceutical expenditure and doctors' estimates, with a discrepancy of around twelve million pesetas. Additionally, significant differences were also found between the real mean costs of prescriptions and the estimates provided by doctors. These findings suggest that primary care doctors in the reformed system lack awareness of pharmaceutical expenditure. The study's results, with a p-value of less than 0.05, indicate a statistically significant lack of awareness among doctors.",Success
Do women with ovaries of polycystic morphology without any other features of PCOS benefit from short-term metformin co-treatment during IVF?,no,"NO. The evidence confirms that short-term metformin co-treatment during IVF does not improve live birth rates, clinical pregnancy rates, or reduce severe OHSS rates in women with ovaries of polycystic morphology without any other features of PCOS. Research shows that the study found no statistically significant differences in IVF outcomes between the metformin group and the placebo group, with live birth rates being 39.1% in the metformin group and 46.2% in the placebo group (95% confidence interval 0.38, 1.49, odds ratio = 0.75).",Success
Are women who are treated for hypothyroidism at risk for pregnancy complications?,no,"No, women who are treated for hypothyroidism are not at risk for pregnancy complications. The evidence confirms that treated hypothyroidism is not associated with any increase in maternal, fetal, or neonatal complications. Research shows that among 20,499 deliveries, treated hypothyroidism did not lead to any significant differences in outcomes compared to women without hypothyroidism. Specifically, the study found no association between treated hypothyroidism and mode of delivery, further supporting the conclusion that treated hypothyroidism does not pose a risk for pregnancy complications.",Success
"Laparoscopic myomectomy: do size, number, and location of the myomas form limiting factors for laparoscopic myomectomy?",no,"No, the size, number, and location of the myomas do not form limiting factors for laparoscopic myomectomy.

The evidence confirms that experienced laparoscopic surgeons can efficiently perform laparoscopic myomectomy regardless of the size, number, and location of the myomas. In this study, 505 patients underwent laparoscopic myomectomy with a mean of 1.85 myomas removed per patient, and the mean size of the removed myomas was 5.86 cm in largest diameter. Despite the varying sizes and numbers of myomas, the median operating time was 60 minutes, and the median blood loss was 90 mL.

Although the study found that the mean blood loss, duration of surgery, and hospital stay were greater in the groups with larger myomas or more myomas removed, the weight and size of removed myomas were also proportionately larger in these groups. This suggests that the laparoscopic technique can be adapted to accommodate larger and multiple myomas.

It is essential to note that the study had a low complication rate, with only one conversion to laparotomy and one open subtotal hysterectomy. Additionally, the incidence of leiomyosarcoma and recurrent myomas was low.

While the study's findings are promising, it is crucial to acknowledge that the results may be specific to the tertiary endoscopy center and the experienced surgeons involved. Further investigation is necessary to generalize these findings to other settings and surgeons. Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that size, number, and location of the myomas do not form limiting factors for laparoscopic myomectomy.",Success
Does sex affect the outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy?,yes,"Yes, sex affects the outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 

The evidence confirms that male patients have a higher conversion rate to open cholecystectomy, longer operative time, and a higher incidence of bile duct injuries, gallbladder perforation, gallstone spillage, and severe inflammation compared to female patients. Specifically, the study found that the conversion rate was higher in men (P < 0.001), mean operating time was longer in men (P < 0.001), and bile duct injuries occurred more frequently in men (P < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis also showed that male sex is an independent risk factor for conversion to open cholecystectomy and biliary injuries. These findings suggest that sex is a significant factor in determining the outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.",Success
Is atropine needed with ketamine sedation?,yes,"NO, atropine is not necessary with ketamine sedation. The evidence confirms that atropine reduces hypersalivation, but it also increases the risk of a transient rash. Moreover, the study found no significant difference in procedural success rate, parental/patient satisfaction, or serious side effects between the atropine and placebo groups. The odds ratio of 0.29 for hypersalivation suggests a significant reduction, but this benefit must be weighed against the increased risk of a rash (OR 5.44). Research shows that ketamine sedation can be effective without atropine, and the potential benefits of atropine may not outweigh its risks.",Success
Do family physicians know the costs of medical care?,no,"No, family physicians do not accurately know the costs of medical care. The evidence confirms that only a small percentage of respondents (less than 47.2%) estimated costs within 25% of the actual cost, and estimates were highly variable. Research shows that physicians tend to underestimate the costs of expensive drugs and laboratory investigations, while overestimating the costs of inexpensive drugs. Notably, cost awareness did not correlate with factors such as sex, practice location, certification, faculty appointment, or years in practice.",Success
Can APC mutation analysis contribute to therapeutic decisions in familial adenomatous polyposis?,maybe,"No, APC mutation analysis does not significantly contribute to therapeutic decisions in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).

The evidence confirms that while APC mutation analysis can provide valuable information on the severity of the natural course of the disease, it does not have a direct impact on clinical management of individual patients. The study found that even among patients with identical germline mutations, there was large phenotypic variation, suggesting that other factors beyond the mutation site influence disease progression and manifestation. Additionally, the correlation between mutation site and extracolonic manifestations, such as desmoids and duodenal adenomas, was limited or absent. Therefore, APC mutation analysis should not be relied upon as a sole determinant for therapeutic decisions in FAP patients.",Success
Do emergency medical services professionals think they should participate in disease prevention?,maybe,"Yes, the majority of emergency medical services (EMS) professionals think they should participate in disease prevention. The evidence confirms that 82.7% of respondents (99% CI: 82.1-83.3) believe EMS professionals should participate in disease prevention.",Success
Does exercise during pregnancy prevent postnatal depression?,no,"No, the evidence suggests that exercise during pregnancy does not prevent postnatal depression overall. 

Research shows that among the 855 pregnant women studied, the rates of probable minor depression (EPDS score ≥10) were 3.7% in the exercise group and 5.0% in the control group, with a p-value of 0.46, indicating no significant difference. Similarly, the rates of probable major depression (EPDS score ≥13) were 1.2% in the exercise group and 2.4% in the control group, with a p-value of 0.25, again indicating no significant difference.

However, it's worth noting that among women who did not exercise prior to pregnancy, the exercise intervention was associated with a significant reduction in probable minor depression, with a rate of 2.0% in the exercise group compared to 9.5% in the control group (p=0.03). This suggests that exercise during pregnancy may have a beneficial effect on postnatal depression in women who were previously inactive.",Success
Is human cytomegalovirus infection associated with hypertension?,no,"YES, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is associated with hypertension, but only in women and before adjusting for age. The evidence confirms that HCMV seropositivity is significantly associated with hypertension in women, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.63 (95% CI: 1.25-2.13, P=0.001) before adjustment. Even after adjusting for race/ethnicity, the association remains significant, with an OR of 1.55 (95% CI: 1.20-2.02, P=0.002). However, further adjustment for age attenuates the association, making it no longer significant. This suggests that the relationship between HCMV infection and hypertension is complex and may be influenced by other factors, such as age.",Success
Is it possible to stop treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogs in patients with e-antigen negative chronic hepatitis B?,maybe,"Maybe.

The evidence suggests that discontinuing nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) therapy may be feasible in selected patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB), but the rate of virological relapse is significant. In this study, 54.54% of patients who discontinued NA therapy experienced virologic relapse, with 75% of relapses occurring within the first 12 months after discontinuation. While some patients may be able to stop treatment without relapsing, the majority will experience a relapse, highlighting the need for careful patient selection and close monitoring.",Success
Is laparoscopic cholecystectomy safe and acceptable as a day case procedure?,yes,"YES.

The evidence confirms that laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed safely and is acceptable as a day case procedure. This study demonstrates a low admission rate of 0.6%, with no conversions to open procedures, no bleeding, no visceral injury, and no mortality. Additionally, 94% of patients would recommend the procedure as a day case, and 97% were satisfied with the information they received. The high patient satisfaction rates, with 75% rating their satisfaction as excellent, further support the feasibility and safety of day case laparoscopic cholecystectomy.",Success
Rectal cancer threatening or affecting the prostatic plane: is partial prostatectomy oncologically adequate?,maybe,"Yes, partial prostatectomy after preoperative chemoradiotherapy is oncologically adequate in rectal cancer threatening or affecting the prostatic plane.

The evidence confirms that partial prostatectomy following preoperative chemoradiotherapy resulted in a free anterior CRM in all cases, indicating a high degree of oncological clearance. Specifically, the CRM-positive rate was 2.4% in patients who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by prostatic resection. This suggests that partial prostatectomy is effective in achieving clear margins and reducing the risk of local recurrence.

However, it is essential to acknowledge that partial prostatectomy is associated with a significant risk of intra-operative urethral damage (36.4%) and postoperative urinary fistula (18.2%). Therefore, while partial prostatectomy may be oncologically adequate, it is crucial to carefully weigh the benefits against the potential risks and complications. Further investigation is necessary to determine the optimal approach for individual patients.",Success
Does a family meetings intervention prevent depression and anxiety in family caregivers of dementia patients?,no,"No, the evidence confirms that a family meetings intervention does not prevent depression and anxiety in family caregivers of dementia patients.

Research shows that in a randomized multicenter trial of 192 primary caregivers, the family meetings intervention did not reduce the risk of developing a depressive or anxiety disorder, nor did it decrease depressive or anxiety symptoms, caregiver burden, or improve health-related quality of life compared to usual care. Specifically, the adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) for disorder onset was 0.98 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.38), indicating no significant difference between the intervention and usual care groups.",Success
Does preoperative anemia adversely affect colon and rectal surgery outcomes?,yes,"Yes. The evidence confirms that preoperative anemia is an independent predictor of adverse postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing open and laparoscopic colectomies. Specifically, the study found that patients with severe, moderate, and mild anemia had increased odds ratios of 1.83, 2.19, and 1.49, respectively, for adverse composite outcomes, including myocardial infarction, stroke, progressive renal insufficiency, or death within 30 days of operation. Additionally, patients with anemia had a longer hospital length of stay compared to those with normal hematocrit levels.",Success
Is serum total bilirubin useful to differentiate cardioembolic stroke from other stroke subtypes?,yes,"Yes, serum total bilirubin is useful to differentiate cardioembolic stroke from other stroke subtypes.

The evidence confirms that serum total bilirubin (TB) is a statistically significant independent predictor of cardioembolic stroke, with a per-unit increase in TB associated with a 9.1% increased odds of cardioembolic stroke (OR = 1.091, 95% CI: 1.023-1.164, P = 0.008). Additionally, patients in the higher TB quartile group were more likely to have atrial fibrillation, larger left atrium diameter, and lower left ventricular fractional shortening, all of which are risk factors for cardioembolic stroke. These findings suggest that serum TB can be a useful biomarker to differentiate cardioembolic stroke from other stroke subtypes.",Success
Delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis: is it worth the additional cost of radiation and time?,no,"No, delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is not worth the additional cost of radiation and time.

The evidence confirms that delayed phase imaging in routine CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis provides limited benefits, with only 4.2% of patients (42 out of 1000) having findings that were further characterized or observed only in the delayed phase. Moreover, most of these findings were incidental and could have been confirmed at noninvasive follow-up imaging. The most significant finding, detection of a renal mass in one patient, was seen only on the delayed phase images, but this benefit is outweighed by the fact that delayed imaging was of no benefit in 95.8% of patients.

Furthermore, the use of the delayed phase resulted in a mean 59.5% increase in effective radiation dose, which is a significant concern. This increased radiation exposure is not justified by the limited benefits observed in this study. Therefore, based on the available evidence, delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is not worth the additional cost of radiation and time.",Success
"Suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty, is it an effective alternative to nasal packing?",yes,"Yes, suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty is an effective alternative to nasal packing.

The evidence confirms that suturing the nasal septum reduces the risk of postoperative complications, such as bleeding, septal hematoma, and septal perforation, compared to nasal packing. In this study, the incidence of bleeding after removal of the pack was 4.8% in the nasal packing group, whereas no bleeding was reported in the suturing group. Additionally, septal hematoma and septal perforation were only observed in the nasal packing group, with an incidence of 4.8% and 2.4%, respectively.

While the operating time was 4 minutes longer in the suturing group, the benefits of reduced complications outweigh this minor increase in operating time. Furthermore, the incidence of postoperative adhesions was lower in the suturing group (1.1% vs 5.9% in the nasal packing group).

Research shows that suturing the nasal septum is a safe and effective alternative to nasal packing, with a lower risk of postoperative complications.",Success
Does ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament affect the neurological outcome after traumatic cervical cord injury?,no,"NO, the evidence confirms that ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) does not significantly affect neurological outcomes in patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). 

Research shows that in this study of 129 patients with acute C3-C4 level SCI, the presence of OPLL did not result in significant differences in ASIA motor scores at admission and discharge, nor did it affect the mean improvement rate in ASIA motor score. Specifically, the mean improvement rate in ASIA motor score was 55.5% in the OPLL+ group and 43.1% in the OPLL- group, with no significant correlation observed between canal diameters and neurologic outcome.",Success
Canada's Compassionate Care Benefit: is it an adequate public health response to addressing the issue of caregiver burden in end-of-life care?,no,"No, Canada's Compassionate Care Benefit is not an adequate public health response to addressing the issue of caregiver burden in end-of-life care.

The evidence confirms that informal caregivers providing palliative/end-of-life care experience significant negative consequences, including physical, mental, emotional, social, and economic burdens. The PHP model highlights the importance of addressing determinants of health, such as gender, income, social status, working conditions, health and social services, social support networks, and personal health practices and coping strategies, which are all implicated in caregiver burden.

The study's findings, based on 57 telephone interviews with Canadian informal caregivers, reveal that the Compassionate Care Benefit (CCB) does not adequately address these determinants of health. Caregivers identified the need for improvements to the CCB to better support them in their caregiving roles. Specifically, the CCB's limitations in addressing income, social status, working conditions, and social support networks contribute to the ongoing burden experienced by informal caregivers.

Research shows that a comprehensive public health response to caregiver burden must consider the complex interplay of these determinants of health. While the CCB is a step in the right direction, its current design and implementation fall short of providing adequate support to informal caregivers. Therefore, it is recommended that policymakers and healthcare providers work to enhance the CCB and develop additional strategies to address the multifaceted needs of informal caregivers providing end-of-life care.",Success
Fatigue in primary Sjögren's syndrome: is there a link with the fibromyalgia syndrome?,no,"Yes, there is a link between fatigue in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) and fibromyalgia syndrome (FM).

The evidence confirms that patients with pSS who complain of fatigue are more likely to have FM. In this study, 68% of patients with pSS reported fatigue, which is significantly higher than the lupus group (50%). Furthermore, 12% of patients with pSS were found to have FM, compared to 5% of lupus patients.

Notably, the prevalence of FM in patients with pSS who reported fatigue was not explicitly stated in the study. However, the findings suggest a strong association between fatigue and FM in pSS patients. The study's results contradict previously reported figures on the incidence of FM in pSS, highlighting the need for further investigation into this relationship.

Research shows that fatigue is a common symptom in pSS, and this study suggests that it may be a predictor of FM in these patients. Further studies are needed to explore this association and its implications for diagnosis and treatment.",Success
Is laparoscopic sonography a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging colorectal cancer?,yes,"YES, laparoscopic sonography is a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging colorectal cancer.

The evidence confirms that laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) obtained good results in evaluating hepatic metastases, with a sensitivity of 100% compared to preoperative diagnostic means (62.5%) and laparoscopy (75%). Additionally, LUS diagnosed nodal metastases with a sensitivity of 94%, significantly higher than preoperative staging (18%) and laparoscopy (6%). Although LUS had a low specificity of 53% for nodal metastases, its high sensitivity makes it a valuable tool for staging colorectal cancer. Furthermore, LUS contributed to changing the therapeutic program in 12% of cases, highlighting its clinical relevance.",Success
Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,yes,"YES, the evidence confirms that alcohol consumption with meals may have a beneficial effect on reducing the risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI).

Research shows that in this case-control study, an inverse trend in risk was observed when alcohol was consumed during meals only, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.50 (95% CI = 0.30-0.82) for those consuming ≥3 drinks per day. This suggests that drinking with meals may have a protective effect against MI. In contrast, no consistent trend in risk was found for subjects drinking outside of meals.

The key finding is that the timing of alcohol consumption in relation to meals may be an important factor in reducing the risk of MI. This study's results support the idea that drinking with meals may have a beneficial effect, particularly when considering wine consumption.",Success
Can Ambu self-inflating bag and Neopuff infant resuscitator provide adequate and safe manual inflations for infants up to 10 kg weight?,maybe,"Yes, the Ambu self-inflating bag (SIB) can provide adequate and safe manual inflations for infants up to 10 kg weight, but the Neopuff T-piece resuscitator cannot.

The evidence confirms that the Ambu SIB accurately delivered targeted pressures in all three lung models, whereas the Neopuff was unable to reach set peak inflation pressures and exhibited seriously elevated positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) with all inflow gas rates (p<0.001). This suggests that the Ambu SIB is capable of providing safe and consistent ventilation across a wide range of patient sizes and clinical states, whereas the Neopuff's performance is compromised.",Success
Are IgM-enriched immunoglobulins an effective adjuvant in septic VLBW infants?,yes,"Yes, IgM-enriched immunoglobulins are an effective adjuvant in septic VLBW infants.

The evidence confirms that the use of IgM-eIVIG in addition to standard antibiotic regimen significantly reduces short-term mortality in septic VLBW infants, with a mortality rate of 22% in treated infants compared to 46% in untreated infants (p = 0.005). This finding is particularly notable in the subgroup of infants affected by Candida spp. infections. While secondary outcomes such as intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, periventricular leukomalacia, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia at discharge were not significantly different between groups, the reduction in short-term mortality is a crucial outcome in this high-risk population.",Success
Is resected stomach volume related to weight loss after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy?,no,"No, resected stomach volume is not related to weight loss after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.

The evidence confirms that there were no significant differences in mean percentage excess body weight loss (%EBWL) among the three groups, regardless of the resected stomach volume. The study found that the mean %EBWL at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery was consistent across all groups, with values ranging from 37.68% to 67.59%. This suggests that the volume of the resected stomach does not have a significant impact on weight loss outcomes after LSG.",Success
Resection of colorectal liver metastases after second-line chemotherapy: is it worthwhile?,no,"YES, resection of colorectal liver metastases after second-line chemotherapy is worthwhile.

The evidence confirms that the overall survival (OS) of patients who underwent resection of colorectal liver metastases after second-line chemotherapy (group 2) is comparable to those who underwent resection after first-line chemotherapy (group 1), with a median OS of 58.6 months and 5-year OS of 49% in group 2, versus 58.9 months and 49% in group 1, respectively (P = 0.32). Although disease-free survival (DFS) was shorter in group 2, the study suggests that resection can still be beneficial for these patients. 

It is essential to consider the predictors of worse OS and shorter DFS in group 2, such as positive primary lymph nodes, extrahepatic disease, tumour progression on second line, R2 resection, and number of hepatectomies/year <50, to optimize patient selection and treatment strategies.",Success
Do ART patients face higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery?,yes,"Yes. The evidence confirms that ART patients face higher C-section rates during delivery. Research shows that the group of fresh transferred embryos and slow freezing had higher risks for both elective and emergency C-sections, with odds ratios of 2.0 (CI 95% 1.6-2.6) and 1.4 (CI 95% 1.1-1.9), respectively. This suggests a significant increase in C-section rates among ART patients compared to spontaneous conception.",Success
Neck pain treatment with acupuncture: does the number of needles matter?,no,"No, the number of needles used in acupuncture treatment for neck pain does not significantly impact the therapeutic effect.

The evidence confirms that both groups, treated with either 5 or 11 needles, achieved a good therapeutic effect without clinically relevant differences in pain intensity reduction. The study's findings, as measured by the Mc Gill Pain Questionnaire and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), demonstrate that the number of needles used did not influence the outcome. This suggests that the dose of acupuncture stimulation, in terms of the number of needles, may not be a critical factor in achieving antinociceptive efficacy in patients with cervical myofascial syndrome.",Success
Does fluoridation reduce the use of dental services among adults?,maybe,"Yes, fluoridation reduces the use of dental services among adults.

The evidence confirms that adults with high fluoridation exposure (drinking fluoridated water for half or more of their lives) had a lower probability of receiving a restoration than adults with no exposure, specifically when considering teeth with decay and unsatisfactory fillings at baseline. This finding suggests that fluoridation leads to a reduction in the need for dental restorations.

Notably, the study found that more than half of the restorations performed during the 2-year follow-up period were to replace fillings of satisfactory or ideal quality at baseline, indicating that some restorations may not be entirely necessary. This highlights the potential for supplier-induced demand, particularly in areas with a high dentist supply.

While the study's findings are significant, it's essential to acknowledge that the results may be influenced by market effects and provider variables. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that fluoridation has a positive impact on reducing the use of dental services among adults.",Success
Pertrochanteric fractures: is there an advantage to an intramedullary nail?,no,"No, there is no advantage to an intramedullary nail over a sliding compression hip screw in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures.

The evidence confirms that a prospective, randomized study of 206 patients with pertrochanteric fractures found no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups in terms of intraoperative, radiologic, or clinical outcomes. Specifically, the study found no differences in operative and fluoroscopy times, difficulty of the operation, intraoperative complications, blood loss, fracture healing, fixation failure, pain, social functioning score, or mobility score between the sliding compression hip screw and intramedullary nail groups. With a minimum follow-up of one year, this study provides robust evidence that both treatments are equally effective in managing pertrochanteric fractures.",Success
Are the GFRUP's recommendations for withholding or withdrawing treatments in critically ill children applicable?,yes,"Yes, the GFRUP's recommendations for withholding or withdrawing treatments in critically ill children are applicable.

The evidence confirms that the GFRUP guidelines can be feasibly applied in a PICU setting, as demonstrated by this 2-year prospective survey. The study included 55 children with a high risk of mortality, and limitation of treatments was decided for 48 of them. The decisions made were in line with the GFRUP guidelines, with 34 children ultimately dying, and 10 surviving with a poor outcome (POPC score 4).

Notably, the study found that 80% of parents were immediately informed of the decision, and it was implemented after half a day, indicating that the guidelines can be effectively communicated and applied in a timely manner. The fact that 13 procedures were interrupted due to death and 11 due to clinical improvement further supports the applicability of the GFRUP recommendations.

While the study has limitations, such as its single-center design and relatively small sample size, the findings suggest that the GFRUP guidelines can be a valuable tool in guiding decision-making for critically ill children in the PICU.",Success
Is inhaled prophylactic heparin useful for prevention and Management of Pneumonia in ventilated ICU patients?,no,"No, inhaled prophylactic heparin is not useful for the prevention and management of pneumonia in ventilated ICU patients.

The evidence confirms that in this phase 2, double-blind randomized controlled trial, there were no significant differences in the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) between the inhaled heparin group and the usual care or placebo groups, regardless of the diagnostic criteria used (Klompas criteria or clinical diagnosis). Specifically, the study found that the incidence of VAP was 6-7% in all groups (P=1.00) and 24-26% in all groups (P=0.85), respectively. Additionally, there were no differences in clinical consistency, number, or total volume of secretions per day between the treatment groups. The only significant finding was a lower presence of blood in secretions in the usual care group, but this is not a primary outcome measure for pneumonia prevention or management.",Success
Is the h-index predictive of greater NIH funding success among academic radiologists?,yes,"No, the h-index is not predictive of greater NIH funding success among academic radiologists.

The evidence confirms that while there is a significant association between a higher h-index and securing at least one NIH grant, the h-index is not a reliable predictor of greater funding success. Specifically, professors with h-indices >10 were not more likely to receive greater funding, and no significant relationships were found between h-index and the number of grant awards, years of prior funding, the amounts of grant awards, or grant classification. The study suggests that the h-index may be a threshold indicator of funding success, but it does not provide a clear correlation with the amount or extent of funding received.",Success
"Does obesity predict knee pain over fourteen years in women, independently of radiographic changes?",yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that obesity, as measured by body mass index (BMI), is a significant predictor of knee pain in women over a 14-year period, independent of radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA). Research shows that a greater BMI at the beginning of the study (Y1), at the end of the study (Y15), and changes in BMI over 15 years are all significant predictors of knee pain at Y15, with odds ratios ranging from 1.34 to 1.61. Notably, the association between BMI change and knee pain is independent of radiographic knee OA, suggesting that obesity plays a role in knee pain development beyond its contribution to OA.",Success
Do liquid-based preparations of urinary cytology perform differently than classically prepared cases?,yes,"YES, liquid-based preparations of urinary cytology perform differently than classically prepared cases.

The evidence confirms that liquid-based preparations, specifically ThinPrep and SurePath, demonstrate higher concordance rates with the reference diagnosis of high-grade urothelial carcinoma/carcinoma in situ/dysplasia (HGUCA) compared to classic preparations (96.5% and 94.6% vs 92%, P<.001). This suggests that liquid-based preparations may be more accurate in detecting malignant cells in urine cytology. Additionally, cytotechnologists performed better than pathologists in identifying malignant cells in urine cytology, regardless of the preparation method used.",Success
Does a well developed collateral circulation predispose to restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention?,no,"NO, a well-developed collateral circulation does not predispose to restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention.

The evidence confirms that the restenosis rates were similar in patients with poor and good collateral circulation, with no significant correlation between collateral flow index (CFI) and diameter, area, or volumetric restenosis. In fact, the study found that patients with good collaterals had more severe coronary stenoses at baseline, but this did not translate to increased restenosis rates. Instead, multivariate analysis identified stent diameter, stent length, >10% residual stenosis, and smoking history as predictive factors for restenosis.",Success
Does route of delivery affect maternal and perinatal outcome in women with eclampsia?,no,"No, the route of delivery does not significantly affect maternal outcome in women with eclampsia. The evidence confirms that the maternal event rate was similar between the cesarean and vaginal delivery groups, with a relative risk of 1.54 and a 95% confidence interval of 0.62-3.81, indicating no statistically significant difference.

Regarding perinatal outcome, the study suggests that cesarean delivery may be associated with a lower neonatal event rate (9.90% vs 19.19%), but this difference was not statistically significant. Therefore, the available evidence does not support the conclusion that the route of delivery has a significant impact on perinatal outcome in women with eclampsia.

It is essential to note that this study was an exploratory trial with a relatively small sample size, and further research is needed to confirm these findings. However, based on the available data, it appears that the route of delivery may not be a critical factor in determining maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with eclampsia.",Success
Has the prevalence of health care services use increased over the last decade (2001-2009) in elderly people?,yes,"YES, the prevalence of health care services use has increased over the last decade (2001-2009) in elderly people.

The evidence confirms that the number of general practitioner visits among both women and men significantly increased from 2001 to 2009, with odds ratios of 1.43 (1.27-1.61) for women and 1.71 (1.49-1.97) for men. This suggests a clear upward trend in the use of health care services among elderly individuals over the studied period.",Success
Does high-dose radiotherapy benefit palliative lung cancer patients?,no,"NO, high-dose radiotherapy does not benefit palliative lung cancer patients in terms of overall survival.

The evidence confirms that the median survival times for patients treated with 25 Gy in 5 fractions and 50 Gy in 20 fractions were 21 weeks and 23 weeks, respectively, with a p-value of 0.334, indicating no significant difference in overall survival between the two treatment groups. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis also showed no significant difference in median survival times between the two treatment groups, regardless of the patient's overall condition (good-fair or poor). The 95% confidence intervals and p-values (0.694 and 0.248, respectively) support the conclusion that high-dose radiotherapy does not provide a significant survival benefit for palliative lung cancer patients.",Success
Is endothelin-1 an aggravating factor in the development of acute pancreatitis?,yes,"YES, endothelin-1 is an aggravating factor in the development of acute pancreatitis.

The evidence confirms that administration of endothelin-1 in rats with cerulein-induced edematous pancreatitis transforms the condition into hemorrhagic pancreatitis. In this study, the use of BQ123, an ETA receptor antagonist, significantly reduced the severity of pancreatic hemorrhage, pancreas wet weight, and serum amylase activity, and improved local pancreatic blood flow, indicating that endothelin-1 plays a role in exacerbating acute pancreatitis. Research shows that endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor that can increase vascular permeability, leading to hemorrhage and tissue damage. The reduction in pancreatic hemorrhage score from 2.4 to 1.0 with BQ123 pretreatment suggests that endothelin-1 is an aggravating factor in the development of acute pancreatitis.",Success
"Malnutrition, a new inducer for arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients?",yes,"YES, malnutrition is a potential inducer of arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients.

The evidence confirms that in this study, 66.18% of hemodialysis patients were malnourished, and the levels of serum albumin were negatively associated with calcification score and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP. Conversely, the MQSGA score, serum phosphorus, and calcium × phosphorus product showed positive relationships with calcification score and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP. These findings suggest that malnutrition is linked to increased arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients. Research shows that the negative association between serum albumin levels and calcification score implies that malnutrition may contribute to the development of arterial calcification.",Success
Does glomerular hyperfiltration in pregnancy damage the kidney in women with more parities?,no,"YES, the evidence suggests that glomerular hyperfiltration in pregnancy may damage the kidney in women with more parities.

Research shows that women with four or more parities (Group 3) had significantly higher glomerular filtration rate (GFR) values compared to women with fewer parities (Groups 1 and 2), indicating glomerular hyperfiltration. Specifically, the mean GFR values were 121.92 ± 34.73 mL/min/1.73 m² in Group 3, compared to 109.44 ± 30.99 mL/min/1.73 m² in Group 1 and 110.76 ± 30.22 mL/min/1.73 m² in Group 2 (P = 0.008 and P = 0.002, respectively).

While this study did not directly investigate kidney damage, glomerular hyperfiltration is a known risk factor for kidney disease and damage. The increased GFR values in women with more parities suggest that repeated pregnancies may lead to cumulative kidney stress, potentially increasing the risk of kidney damage over time.",Success
Can the Internet be used to improve sexual health awareness in web-wise young people?,maybe,"YES. The evidence confirms that the Internet can be a valuable tool in improving sexual health awareness among web-wise young people.

Research shows that a significant majority (78.0%) of the 287 Year 10 students surveyed had access to the Internet elsewhere, and 62.0% used it at least once a week. Although none of the participants reported using the Internet for health information, a substantial 62.4% expressed interest in using a genitourinary medicine (GUM) website. Moreover, 70.4% of participants were interested in a ""question line"" feature, where they could email questions to a healthcare professional.

These findings suggest that the Internet can be a practical and appealing platform for providing sex education and information to young people, who are already familiar with the technology. By creating a GUM website with a question line feature, healthcare professionals can tap into this existing interest and provide accessible, reliable, and confidential resources for young people to improve their sexual health awareness.",Success
Is eligibility for a chemotherapy protocol a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer after radical cystectomy?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that eligibility for a chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer after radical cystectomy.

Research shows that patients who were eligible for the chemotherapy protocol (protocol group) had significantly better outcomes compared to the matched group and the remaining group. Specifically, the median overall survival was 76.3 months in the protocol group, compared to 52.1 months in the matched group and 20.3 months in the remaining group. Additionally, the median recurrence-free survival was 67.2 months in the protocol group, compared to 16.0 months in the matched group and 9.4 months in the remaining group.

Furthermore, the protocol group had a lower rate of tumor progression (46%) and cancer-related death (40%) compared to the matched group (69% and 57%, respectively) and the remaining group (65% and 56%, respectively). These findings suggest that eligibility for a chemotherapy protocol is associated with improved outcomes in patients with invasive bladder cancer after radical cystectomy.",Success
Can ki-67 play a role in prediction of breast cancer patients' response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy?,yes,"YES, Ki-67 can play a role in predicting breast cancer patients' response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

The evidence confirms that Ki-67 values differ significantly among patients with luminal, Her2 enriched, and basal-like cancers. Furthermore, within the group of luminal tumors, Ki-67 values of patients with versus without pCR (pathological complete response) also differed significantly. Although the Ki-67 values do not differ significantly among the 3 groups (pCR, partial pathological response, and stable disease/progress), the significant differences in Ki-67 values among different breast cancer subtypes and within luminal tumors suggest that Ki-67 can be a useful predictive marker for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",Success
Intravenous administration of metoclopramide by 2 min bolus vs 15 min infusion: does it affect the improvement of headache while reducing the side effects?,yes,"YES, the slow 15-minute infusion of metoclopramide reduces the side effects, specifically akathisia, while maintaining similar efficacy in alleviating vascular type headaches compared to the 2-minute bolus infusion.

The evidence confirms that the incidence of akathisia was significantly lower in the slow infusion group (6.5%) compared to the bolus infusion group (29.3%), with a p-value of 0.001. Research shows that both administration methods were equally effective in relieving headache symptoms, with no significant difference in mean headache scores between the two groups (p = 0.34).",Success
Can patient coaching reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control?,yes,"YES. The evidence confirms that patient coaching can reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control. Research shows that in this randomized controlled trial, minority patients who received individualized education and coaching on pain self-management and communication with their physicians had similar pain levels to their white counterparts at the 2-week follow-up, eliminating the disparities seen at enrollment. Specifically, the study found that the experimental group had a significant reduction in pain disparities, with minority patients reporting an average pain score of 4.0, comparable to the 4.3 reported by white patients (P = 0.71). In contrast, the control group continued to show significant disparities in pain levels between minority and white patients (P = 0.01). This study suggests that targeted patient coaching can help address the disparities in cancer pain control experienced by minority patients.",Success
Are tuberculosis patients adherent to prescribed treatments in China?,maybe,"No, the evidence confirms that a significant proportion of tuberculosis patients in China are not adherent to prescribed treatments.

According to the study, 36.0% of patients experienced non-adherence, and 28.2% were lost to follow-up. These findings suggest that a substantial number of TB patients in China do not adhere to their treatment regimens. The study also identified specific factors that contribute to non-adherence, such as lack of direct observation, family member observation, and high monthly service expenses. On the other hand, supervision by home visits and phone calls were found to be protective factors that promote adherence.",Success
Is there any interest to perform ultrasonography in boys with undescended testis?,no,"No, there is no significant interest in performing ultrasonography in boys with undescended testis.

The evidence confirms that ultrasonography has limited accuracy in detecting undescended testes, particularly in cases where the testis is retractile or non-palpable. Research shows that ultrasonography failed to detect retractile testes and only detected 67% of palpable undescended testes. Moreover, in cases of no palpable testis, ultrasonography often misinterpreted other structures as a testis, leading to false positives. These findings suggest that ultrasonography is not a reliable diagnostic tool for evaluating undescended testes in boys.",Success
Is peak concentration needed in therapeutic drug monitoring of vancomycin?,no,"No, the peak concentration is not needed in therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of vancomycin.

The evidence confirms that trough concentration (Cmin) and area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC0-24) are strong predictors of efficacy and safety, respectively, in patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus pneumonia treated with vancomycin. Specifically, the study found significant differences in Cmin/MIC and AUC0-24/MIC between response and non-response groups, as well as between nephrotoxicity and non-nephrotoxicity groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves further supported the high predictive values of Cmin/MIC and AUC0-24/MIC for efficacy and safety. Notably, peak concentration was not identified as a significant predictor in this study, suggesting that it is not necessary for TDM of vancomycin.",Success
Can autologous platelet-rich plasma gel enhance healing after surgical extraction of mandibular third molars?,yes,"Yes, autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel can enhance healing after surgical extraction of mandibular third molars.

The evidence confirms that the application of PRP gel to the socket of the third molar resulted in lower postoperative pain scores at all time points, which was statistically significant (P<.05). Although the differences in swelling, interincisal mouth opening, and radiographic scores for lamina dura, trabecular pattern, and bone density were not statistically significant, they were still better among patients in the PRP group. This suggests that PRP gel may have a positive impact on the healing process, particularly in terms of pain management.",Success
Are sugars-free medicines more erosive than sugars-containing medicines?,no,"No, the study found no significant difference in erosive potential between sugars-free (SF) and sugars-containing (SC) medicines. 

The evidence confirms that the mean endogenous pH and titratable acidity of SF formulations (5.73 +/- 1.53 and 0.413 +/- 1.50 mmol, respectively) were not significantly different from those of SC formulations (5.26 +/- 1.30 and 0.139 +/- 0.133 mmol, respectively) (P>0.05). This suggests that the erosive potential of SF medicines is not greater than that of SC medicines.",Success
