Double balloon enteroscopy: is it efficacious and safe in a community setting?,yes,"YES.

Rationale: The study demonstrates that DBE can be performed safely and efficaciously in a community setting, with a high success rate of endoscopic therapy (30.3% for electrocautery, 25.8% for biopsy, and 6.1% for dilation of strictures). Additionally, the study shows a high concordance rate (74.4%) between VCE findings and DBE confirmation, indicating the accuracy of DBE in diagnosing small bowel pathology. The procedure times and distances reached also suggest that DBE can be performed efficiently in a community setting.",Success
Do mutations causing low HDL-C promote increased carotid intima-media thickness?,no,"NO. 

Rationale: The study found that despite significantly lower HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels in cases with genetic mutations, the carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was nearly identical between cases and controls, suggesting that these mutations do not promote increased cIMT.",Success
A short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital: are they effective?,yes,"YES. The study suggests that the short stay ward is an effective addition to the emergency service in both general and academic children's hospitals, as it increases hospital efficiency, reduces length of stay, and has a low rate of admission to in-hospital beds and unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge, while also resulting in significant cost savings.",Success
Did Chile's traffic law reform push police enforcement?,yes,"YES. The study suggests that the enactment of the traffic law reform in 2005 led to an increase in police traffic enforcement, as measured by the number of traffic tickets per police officer, which in turn contributed to a significant reduction in traffic fatalities and injuries.",Success
Therapeutic anticoagulation in the trauma patient: is it safe?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found that 21% of trauma patients who received therapeutic anticoagulation experienced complications, including a sudden drop in hemoglobin concentration requiring blood transfusion and significant hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulation. Additionally, 4% of patients died, with 3 of those deaths attributed to anticoagulation-related hemorrhage. These findings suggest that therapeutic anticoagulation in trauma patients is not entirely safe.",Success
Prompting Primary Care Providers about Increased Patient Risk As a Result of Family History: Does It Work?,no,NO.,Success
Do emergency ultrasound fellowship programs impact emergency medicine residents' ultrasound education?,yes,"YES. According to the study, residents in programs with EUS fellowships reported performing more scans and had significant differences in most applications of bedside US compared to those in programs without fellowships.",Success
Is there still a need for living-related liver transplantation in children?,yes,"Maybe.

Rationale: The study compared the outcomes of split-liver transplantation (SLT) and living-related liver transplantation (LRT) and found similar patient and graft survival rates, liver function parameters, and surgical complication rates between the two groups. However, the incidence of primary nonfunction was higher in the SLT group, and serum values of alanine aminotransferase were significantly higher in the SLT group during the first postoperative week. Additionally, there were more grafts with signs of fatty degeneration in the LRT group. These findings suggest that LRT may have some advantages over SLT, particularly in terms of graft quality and function. However, the study does not provide conclusive evidence to determine whether LRT is still necessary in children. Further studies are needed to fully assess the benefits and drawbacks of each approach in the pediatric population.",Success
Do patterns of knowledge and attitudes exist among unvaccinated seniors?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study identified four distinct clusters of unvaccinated seniors based on their immunization-related knowledge and attitudes, indicating that patterns of knowledge and attitudes do exist among this population.",Success

Secondhand smoke risk in infants discharged from an NICU: potential for significant health disparities?,yes,YES.,Success
Are reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain related to somatisation?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that the association between mechanical factors (teeth grinding and facial trauma) and chronic oro-facial pain was also seen with the reporting of other frequently unexplained syndromes, which is a characteristic of somatization. This suggests that the relationship between mechanical factors and chronic oro-facial pain may be influenced by somatization.",Success
Is the Hawkins sign able to predict necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus?,maybe,"YES. According to the study, the Hawkins sign was observed in 12 cases, and none of them developed avascular necrosis. On the other hand, 4 cases with a negative Hawkins sign developed necrosis, and the difference was statistically significant (P=.03). This suggests that the presence of the Hawkins sign is a predictor of not developing avascular necrosis in fractures of the neck of the astragalus.",Success
Is a mandatory general surgery rotation necessary in the surgical clerkship?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found no significant differences in scores between students who completed a general surgery rotation and those who did not, across various assessment parameters. This suggests that the objectives of the surgical clerkship can be achieved without a mandatory general surgery rotation.",Success
Is Acupuncture Efficacious for Treating Phonotraumatic Vocal Pathologies?,yes,"YES.

Rationale: The study found significant improvements in vocal function and quality of life in both the genuine and sham acupuncture groups, indicating a positive effect of acupuncture on phonotraumatic vocal fold lesions. Moreover, the genuine acupuncture group demonstrated a significant reduction in the size of the vocal fold lesions, suggesting a specific therapeutic effect of acupuncture on the underlying pathology.",Success
Is aneurysm repair justified for the patients aged 80 or older after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that patients aged 80 or older who received aneurysm repair (clipping or coil embolization) had significantly better clinical outcomes compared to those who received conservative treatment, despite no differences in WFNS grade on admission and premorbid modified Rankin Scale. This suggests that aneurysm repair is a feasible and beneficial treatment option for elderly patients with aSAH.",Success
Do general practice characteristics influence uptake of an information technology (IT) innovation in primary care?,no,"No. According to the study, none of the general practice variables (total list size, training status, numbers of GPs, mean age of GPs, numbers of female GPs, level of deprivation of the population) were associated with online use, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff. This suggests that general practice characteristics do not significantly influence the uptake of the IT innovation in primary care.",Success
Do follow-up recommendations for abnormal Papanicolaou smears influence patient adherence?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46), suggesting that the type of follow-up recommendation (colposcopy or repeated Pap smear) does not influence patient adherence.",Success
Does diabetes mellitus influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer?,no,NO.,Success
Biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery: is there a difference between advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis?,yes,YES.,Success
Does radiotherapy of the primary rectal cancer affect prognosis after pelvic exenteration for recurrent rectal cancer?,yes,"YES. According to the study, radiotherapy for primary rectal cancer is associated with poorer outcomes after pelvic exenteration for local recurrence, including lower rates of clear resection margins, increased surgical complications, and lower disease-free survival.",Success
Is motion perception deficit in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality?,yes,"NO.

Rationale: The study found that when eye movement was minimized (150 msec stimulus duration), schizophrenia patients did not show a motion perception deficit compared to control subjects. However, when eye movement was more likely to occur (300 msec stimulus duration), patients had significantly higher speed discrimination thresholds than control subjects. This suggests that the motion perception deficit in schizophrenia may be related to the interaction between eye movement and motion perception, rather than being a direct consequence of eye-tracking abnormality.",Success
Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy: is it possible?,yes,"YES. According to the study, the researchers successfully performed transgastric endoscopic splenectomy on six pigs without complications during gastric incision and entrance into the peritoneal cavity, and were able to visualize the spleen, ligate the splenic vessels, and mobilize the spleen using commercially available devices and endoscopic accessories.",Success
It's Fournier's gangrene still dangerous?,yes,YES.,Success
Do provider service networks result in lower expenditures compared with HMOs or primary care case management in Florida's Medicaid program?,yes,"YES. According to the study, among SSI enrollees, Demonstration PSNs lowered PMPM expenditures by $7 more than HMOs, indicating that provider service networks result in lower expenditures compared to HMOs in Florida's Medicaid program.",Success
Assessment of carotid artery stenosis before coronary artery bypass surgery. Is it always necessary?,no,No.,Success
Should direct mesocolon invasion be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer?,maybe,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that patients with direct mesocolon invasion had worse curability, more extensive nodal metastasis, and poorer survival compared to the T3 group, indicating that mesocolon invasion is a significant prognostic factor. However, the survival of patients with mesocolon invasion who underwent curative resection was better than those with incurable factors. This suggests that mesocolon invasion should be considered a T4 factor, as it is a significant indicator of poor prognosis and may influence treatment decisions.",Success
Does pretreatment with statins improve clinical outcome after stroke?,no,"NO.

Rationale: Although the unadjusted odds ratio suggested a possible benefit of statin pretreatment on early discharge to home, the multiple-adjusted odds ratio, which controlled for prognostic factors, was not statistically significant. This suggests that any apparent benefit of statin pretreatment may be due to other factors, and the study did not provide conclusive evidence that statin pretreatment improves clinical outcome after stroke.",Success
Human papillomavirus and pterygium. Is the virus a risk factor?,maybe,"NO. 

Rationale: The study found that only 4 out of 90 pterygia specimens (4.4%) were positive for HPV, and all of them were HPV type 6. Additionally, the 20 normal conjunctival biopsy specimens were HPV negative. The low prevalence of HPV in pterygia specimens and the absence of HPV in normal conjunctival tissue suggest that HPV is not a significant risk factor for the development of pterygia.",Success
Can PRISM predict length of PICU stay?,no,"Maybe.

Rationale: The study found a statistically significant correlation between PRISM scores and length of PICU stay (LOS), with Spearman and Pearson coefficients of 0.2 and 0.08, respectively. However, the correlation coefficients are relatively low, suggesting that PRISM scores may not be a strong predictor of LOS. Additionally, the study found that an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on PRISM item patterns performed only slightly better in estimating LOS, with a Pearson coefficient of correlation of 0.21. While there is some association between PRISM scores and LOS, the predictive power is limited.",Success
Can predilatation in transcatheter aortic valve implantation be omitted?,yes,YES.,Success
Autoerotic asphyxiation: secret pleasure--lethal outcome?,yes,YES.,Success
Does a colonoscopy after acute diverticulitis affect its management?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, no colonic malignancy was detected, and only 1 advanced adenoma was found among the 32 patients with polyps. Additionally, no new or different diagnosis was made after colonoscopy. This suggests that colonoscopy did not provide any significant information that would alter the management of acute diverticulitis in these patients.",Success
"Body perception: do parents, their children, and their children's physicians perceive body image differently?",yes,YES.,Success
Is there any relationship between streptococcal infection and multiple sclerosis?,yes,YES.,Success
Is tumour expression of VEGF associated with venous invasion and survival in pT3 renal cell carcinoma?,maybe,"YES. 

Rationale: According to the study, VEGF expression was significantly associated with survival on both univariate and multivariate analysis, and it was identified as an independent predictive factor of survival with an odds ratio of 6.07. However, there was no significant difference in VEGF expression between the groups with and without vena cava invasion, suggesting that VEGF expression is not specifically associated with venous invasion.",Success
Injury and poisoning mortality among young men--are there any common factors amenable to prevention?,yes,YES.,Success
Does either obesity or OSA severity influence the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects?,yes,"Based on the study, the answer is:

* Obesity: NO (there was no significant correlation between autoCPAP pressure and neck circumference, waist circumference, or BMI)
* OSA severity: YES (there was a moderate correlation between autoCPAP pressure and OSA severity, as measured by AHI and ODI)

Rationale: The study found no significant correlation between obesity measurements (neck circumference, waist circumference, and BMI) and autoCPAP pressure, suggesting that obesity does not influence the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects. However, the study did find a moderate correlation between OSA severity (measured by AHI and ODI) and autoCPAP pressure, indicating that OSA severity does influence the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects.",Success
Aripiprazole: a new risk factor for pathological gambling?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study analyzed 8 patients treated with aripiprazole and found that in 7 out of 8 cases, the probability that pathological gambling is due to aripiprazole is considered ""possible"", suggesting a potential link between aripiprazole and pathological gambling.",Success
Immune suppression by lysosomotropic amines and cyclosporine on T-cell responses to minor and major histocompatibility antigens: does synergy exist?,yes,"YES. According to the study, the combination of lysosomotropic amines (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) with cyclosporine results in synergistic suppression of T-cell responses to minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHC) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in mice.",Success
Does induction chemotherapy have a role in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma?,yes,YES.,Success
"Are normally sighted, visually impaired, and blind pedestrians accurate and reliable at making street crossing decisions?",maybe,"No.

Rationale: According to the study, normally sighted and visually impaired pedestrians were accurate and reliable in their street crossing decision-making ability when using either vision plus hearing or vision only. However, under the hearing only condition, all subjects, including normally sighted and visually impaired, were inaccurate (P<0.05). Additionally, blind subjects were the least accurate with their street crossing decisions under the hearing only condition. Therefore, the answer is no, as accuracy and reliability varied depending on the sensory condition and subject group.",Success
Is Chaalia/Pan Masala harmful for health?,yes,"YES. According to the study, 96% of the children considered Chaalia harmful for health, and 60% considered Pan Masala harmful for health.",Success
Is HIV/STD control in Jamaica making a difference?,yes,"YES. The data suggests that the comprehensive HIV/STD Control Program in Jamaica has been effective in controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Although the annual AIDS incidence rate has increased marginally, HIV prevalence in the general population remains low (about 1% or less). Additionally, there have been significant declines in syphilis rates and congenital syphilis cases. Furthermore, the program has led to increased condom use among various groups, including women, men, gay men, inner-city adults, and adolescents, which is a key indicator of successful HIV/STD prevention. The significant increases in condom sales and distribution also support this conclusion.",Success
Is Panton-Valentine leucocidin associated with the pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in the UK?,maybe,"NO. 

Rationale: The study found that only 1.6% of S. aureus isolates from bacteraemic patients in the UK and Ireland were PVL-positive, and all of these were methicillin-susceptible. The low prevalence of PVL-positive isolates suggests that PVL may not play a significant role in the pathogenesis of S. aureus bacteraemia in the UK.",Success
Are even impaired fasting blood glucose levels preoperatively associated with increased mortality after CABG surgery?,yes,YES.,Success
Does positron emission tomography change management in primary rectal cancer?,yes,"YES. According to the study, positron emission tomography (PET) changed the management in 17% of patients with primary rectal cancer, including cancellation of surgery in 13% and changes to radiotherapy fields in 4%. Additionally, PET-induced changes were confirmed to be appropriate in subsequent clinical follow-up.",Success
Can you deliver accurate tidal volume by manual resuscitator?,no,"NO. 

Rationale: According to the study, the volume delivered to the patient varies by the method used (one-handed, two-handed, or two-handed half-compression), but not by the physical characteristics of the person or their education and practice levels. The study found significant differences in tidal volumes delivered by different methods, but no correlation with physical aspects or education/practice levels, indicating that accurate tidal volume delivery by manual resuscitator is challenging.",Success
Does hypoglycaemia increase the risk of cardiovascular events?,yes,"YES. According to the ORIGIN trial, severe hypoglycaemia was associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular events, including the composite outcome of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or stroke, as well as mortality, CV death, and arrhythmic death.",Success
Is dexamethasone an effective alternative to oral prednisone in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations?,yes,"YES. According to the reviewed literature, dexamethasone is an effective alternative to oral prednisone in the treatment of pediatric asthma exacerbations, particularly for mild to moderate cases. The meta-analysis of six clinical trials found no significant difference in symptomatic return to baseline and unplanned physician revisits between dexamethasone and prednisone groups, suggesting equivalent efficacy. Additionally, some studies suggested potential benefits of dexamethasone, such as improved compliance and reduced vomiting.",Success
Mammographic screening in Sami speaking municipalities and a control group. Are early outcome measures influenced by ethnicity?,yes,"YES. The study found that the attendance rate, recall rates, and percentage of breast cancers detected through the NBCSP were influenced by ethnicity, with significant differences between the Sami and non-Sami populations.",Success
Cycloplegic autorefraction in young adults: is it mandatory?,maybe,NO.,Success
Does screening or surveillance for primary hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasonography improve the prognosis of patients?,yes,"YES. The study found that screened patients had significantly better prognostic outcomes, including longer survival time, better tumor morphology, and earlier T staging, compared to unscreened patients. Additionally, patients under surveillance had better outcomes compared to those without surveillance. The adjusted odds ratios and confidence intervals indicate a statistically significant improvement in prognosis with screening and surveillance.",Success
"""Would a man smell a rose then throw it away?",maybe,"NO.

Rationale: This question appears to be related to the theme ""Marital needs and obligations"" and the men's views about other men's rejection of a wife inflicted by breast cancer. The phrase ""Would a man smell a rose then throw it away?"" is likely a metaphorical expression suggesting that a man would not abandon his wife, who is like a precious rose, due to her illness. The study suggests that men in this context do not reject their wives due to breast cancer, but rather provide support and care.",Success
Does microbial contamination influence the success of the hematopoietic cell transplantation outcomes?,maybe,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, none of the patients who received contaminated products died within the post-transplant 30-day period. Although 8 out of 9 patients with microbial contamination experienced febrile neutropenic attacks, the study does not provide evidence to suggest that microbial contamination significantly influenced the success of hematopoietic cell transplantation outcomes.",Success
Very high serum CA 19-9 levels: a contraindication to pancreaticoduodenectomy?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, there was no statistical difference in the median and 3-year overall survival between patients with high levels (400-899 IU/ml) and very high levels (>or=900 IU/ml) of CA 19-9. This suggests that very high serum CA 19-9 levels do not necessarily predict a worse outcome or contraindicate pancreaticoduodenectomy.",Success
Are physicians aware of the side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors?,no,No.,Success
Residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: is fundectomy safe and effective as revision surgery?,maybe,YES.,Success
Are physician estimates of asthma severity less accurate in black than in white patients?,yes,"YES. According to the study, black patients were significantly more likely to have their asthma severity underestimated by physicians compared to white patients (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.08-1.79).",Success
Do communication disorders extend to musical messages?,yes,YES.,Success
Can infundibular height predict the clearance of lower pole calyceal stone after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy?,yes,"YES. According to the study, the height of the infundibulum was the only renal anatomical factor that showed significant differences between the stone-free (NR) group and the residual fragments (R) group, suggesting that infundibular height can be used to predict the clearance of lower pole calyceal stones after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy.",Success
Does lung ischemia and reperfusion have an impact on coronary flow?,yes,"YES. According to the study, total coronary flow (TCF) decreased significantly during lung ischemia and reperfusion, with the lowest value observed at 60 min of reperfusion (-37.1%, p<0.003).",Success
Is duration of psychological treatment for depression related to return into treatment?,yes,"YES. According to the study, patients with a shorter duration of treatment were more likely to return into mental health care, indicating a relationship between duration of treatment and return into treatment.",Success
The influence of atmospheric pressure on aortic aneurysm rupture--is the diameter of the aneurysm important?,maybe,"YES. 

The study suggests that the diameter of the aneurysm may be important in the relationship between atmospheric pressure and aortic aneurysm rupture. Specifically, the study found a non-significant trend towards a higher rupture rate of large aneurysms (>7 cm) when atmospheric pressure increased between the day before the rupture and the day of the rupture, particularly in patients with hypertension. This implies that the diameter of the aneurysm may play a role in the potential influence of atmospheric pressure on rupture risk.",Success
Do somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression?,maybe,"YES, but only in women.",Success
Does the leukocyte count correlate with the severity of injury?,yes,"YES. According to the study, statistical analysis revealed that WBC count was correlated positively with ISS, which suggests that a higher WBC count is associated with a higher severity of injury.",Success
Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms?,yes,"No.

Rationale: While the study found a significant association between musculoskeletal symptoms and bone mineral density (BMD), it also identified other factors that contribute to these symptoms, such as previous tamoxifen use and the type of AI used (steroidal vs nonsteroidal). Additionally, the study showed that the administration of calcium/bisphosphonate (Ca/Bis) reduced musculoskeletal symptoms and fractures. This suggests that preventing osteoporosis is not the sole key to eliminating AI-related musculoskeletal symptoms, and a multifaceted approach may be necessary to address these symptoms.",Success
Could different follow-up modalities play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses?,maybe,"YES. The study suggests that different follow-up modalities, such as clinical visits, imaging, and cytologic examinations, can play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses. In this study, 165 patients (58.5%) were asymptomatic, and the diagnostic path was introduced by a planned visit or examination, with clinical visit alone leading to further examinations in 36.4% of cases, imaging in 62.4%, and cytologic examination in 1.2%. This indicates that these follow-up modalities can detect asymptomatic recurrences, which can impact survival outcomes.",Success
May student examiners be reasonable substitute examiners for faculty in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that students achieved significantly higher scores in some OSCE stations (TM, AM, and OE) and overall OSCE score when examined by student examiners (SE) compared to faculty examiners (FE). Although FE performed better in the PE station, and students gave higher ratings to FE in the ACS station and overall OSCE evaluation, the effect sizes were mostly small. This suggests that student examiners can be a reasonable substitute for faculty examiners in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies, as they can provide similar or even better assessment outcomes in certain areas.",Success
Do all ethnic groups in New Zealand exhibit socio-economic mortality gradients?,yes,"YES. According to the study, all four ethnic groups (Asian, Pacific, Maori, and European) in New Zealand exhibit deprivation gradients in all-cause mortality, as estimated by fitting generalized linear models to the quintile-specific life expectancy estimates for each ethnic group by sex.",Success
Can normal knee kinematics be restored with unicompartmental knee replacement?,no,"YES. 

Rationale: According to the study, no significant differences in tibial axial rotation were found between the intact and unicompartmental conditions, suggesting that unicompartmental knee replacement can restore normal knee kinematics. Additionally, femoral rollback was not significantly affected by unicompartmental arthroplasty, further supporting this conclusion.",Success
Are serum leptin levels a prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, the analysis of serum leptin values did not show any association with the overall survival of the patients, indicating that serum leptin levels are not a prognostic factor in advanced lung cancer.",Success
Would corrected QT dispersion predict left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive patients?,yes,YES.,Success
Inpatient versus outpatient management of neutropenic fever in gynecologic oncology patients: is risk stratification useful?,yes,"YES, risk stratification using the MASCC risk index score is useful in inpatient versus outpatient management of neutropenic fever in gynecologic oncology patients.",Success
Can bisphosphonate treatment be stopped in a growing child with skeletal fragility?,maybe,"NO. 

Rationale: The case report suggests that discontinuing bisphosphonate treatment in a growing child with skeletal fragility, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, may lead to a rapid decline in bone mineral density and an increased risk of new fractures. The patient in this report experienced remodelling of vertebral fractures and improvement in bone mineral density during treatment, but shortly after discontinuation, he suffered new stress fractures and a significant decrease in spinal trabecular and distal radial vBMD. This suggests that bisphosphonate treatment may need to be continued indefinitely to maintain bone health in growing children with skeletal fragility.",Success
Does blood pressure change in treated hypertensive patients depending on whether it is measured by a physician or a nurse?,yes,YES.,Success
Does rural or urban residence make a difference to neonatal outcome in premature birth?,yes,"YES. According to the study, rural residence is associated with poorer outcomes, including higher mortality rates, compared to urban residence, despite a coordinated referral and transport system.",Success
Storage of vaccines in the community: weak link in the cold chain?,maybe,YES.,Success
Is the clinically positive axilla in breast cancer really a contraindication to sentinel lymph node biopsy?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found that clinical examination of the axilla was inaccurate in 41% of patients, with false-positive results in 53% of patients with moderately suspicious nodes and 23% of patients with highly suspicious nodes. This suggests that a clinically positive axilla is not a reliable indicator of metastasis, and therefore, should not be considered a contraindication to sentinel lymph node biopsy.",Success
Are Biochemical Markers of Bone Turnover Representative of Bone Histomorphometry in 370 Postmenopausal Women?,maybe,YES.,Success
Should early extubation be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that early extubation (≤ 24 hours) was associated with lower mortality (1% vs 9%, P<.001) and a lower rate of reintubation (4% vs 23%, P<.001) compared with delayed extubation. Additionally, the implementation of an early extubation strategy was associated with low rates of complications, short lengths of intensive care unit stay, and short hospital stays. These findings suggest that early extubation should be the goal for children after congenital cardiac surgery.",Success
Percutaneous ethanol injection for benign cystic thyroid nodules: is aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid advantageous?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found no significant difference in the success rates of percutaneous ethanol injection with and without aspiration of ethanol-mixed fluid for treating benign cystic thyroid nodules. However, the aspiration group (group B) had a higher incidence of intracystic hemorrhage and longer procedure time due to the additional steps involved.",Success
Are there risk factors that increase the rate of staple line leakage in patients undergoing primary sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity?,yes,"YES. According to the study, several risk factors were associated with a significantly higher leakage rate, including male gender, higher BMI, concomitant sleep apnea, conversion to laparotomy, longer operation time, use of both buttresses and oversewing, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications.",Success
Chronic functional somatic symptoms: a single syndrome?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found that patients with chronic functional somatic symptoms presented with symptoms in at least two body systems, suggesting a multisystemic nature of the condition. Additionally, they had higher rates of psychiatric morbidity, used more somatic and psychotropic drugs, and were referred to mental health workers and somatic specialists more often. This heterogeneity of symptoms and comorbidities argues against the idea of a single syndrome.",Success
"Actinobaculum schaalii, a cause of urinary tract infections in children?",maybe,YES.,Success
Prevalence of chronic conditions among Medicare Part A beneficiaries in 2008 and 2010: are Medicare beneficiaries getting sicker?,yes,YES.,Success
Do patients with localized prostate cancer treatment really want more aggressive treatment?,no,No.,Success
Does music influence stress in mechanically ventilated patients?,no,"NO. 

Rationale: According to the study, there were no significant differences in urinary free cortisol (UFC) levels, a biomarker of stress, among the groups receiving patient-directed music, headphones only, or usual ICU care, after controlling for illness severity, gender, and baseline UFC. This suggests that music did not have a significant influence on stress in mechanically ventilated patients.",Success
Is the holmium:YAG laser the best intracorporeal lithotripter for the ureter?,yes,"YES.

Rationale: The study demonstrates a high success rate of 92.7% at the time of ureteroscopy and 96.7% at 3 months, with a low complication rate, suggesting that holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy is an effective and safe treatment for ureteral stones. Additionally, the holmium:YAG laser is widely accepted as the gold standard for intracorporeal lithotripsy due to its ability to fragment stones of all compositions and its minimal risk of complications.",Success
Metered-dose inhalers. Do health care providers know what to teach?,no,No.,Success
Should general practitioners call patients by their first names?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: According to the study, most patients (398 out of 475) either liked or did not mind being called by their first names, indicating a general acceptance of this practice.",Success
Attenuation of ischemia/reperfusion-induced ovarian damage in rats: does edaravone offer protection?,yes,YES.,Success
"Young-Burgess classification of pelvic ring fractures: does it predict mortality, transfusion requirements, and non-orthopaedic injuries?",maybe,"No/Maybe/Yes.

Rationale: The Young-Burgess classification system did not predict mortality (P = 0.07), but it did differentiate transfusion requirements among different fracture types. Additionally, dividing fractures into stable and unstable types allowed the system to predict mortality rates, abdomen injury rates, and transfusion requirements.",Success
Is unsafe sexual behaviour increasing among HIV-infected individuals?,no,No.,Success
Cholestasis associated with small bowel atresia: do we always need to investigate?,no,"No.

Rationale: According to the study, cholestasis in patients with small bowel atresia (SBA) often resolves spontaneously, and no patient had biliary atresia or died from isolated cholestasis/cirrhosis. Furthermore, in-depth evaluations, including liver biopsies, did not reveal any underlying conditions that required intervention. Therefore, it may not be necessary to always investigate cholestasis in patients with SBA, especially if it is attributed to prolonged parental nutrition.",Success
Can medical students contribute to quality assurance programmes in day surgery?,yes,YES.,Success
Measurement of head and neck paragangliomas: is volumetric analysis worth the effort?,yes,"NO. 

Rationale: According to the study, the manual area tracing method showed better results in measuring tumours with irregular shapes, such as those in the temporal bone and conglomerates. However, the linear dimension method was significantly faster and still provided acceptable results. The automated segmentation method, which is a form of volumetric analysis, failed technically and was not reliable. Therefore, based on the study's findings, volumetric analysis may not be worth the effort due to its technical difficulties and limited benefits compared to other methods.",Success
Three-dimensional ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy: is it a reliable method for the histological assessment of breast lesions?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study demonstrated high sensitivity (96.9% and 96.5%) and specificity (100%) for malignancy, with low false-negative rates (3.1% and 3.5%) and no false-positive results, indicating that 3D ultrasound-validated large-core needle biopsy is a reliable method for the histological assessment of breast lesions.",Success

Is oncoplastic surgery a contraindication for accelerated partial breast radiation using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method?,maybe,"NO. 

Rationale: The study evaluated the use of accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in patients who underwent oncoplastic surgery for early breast cancer and found that APBI was feasible and effective in this patient population. The results showed low rates of local recurrence and systemic progression, with acceptable toxicity profiles. Therefore, oncoplastic surgery is not a contraindication for APBI using the interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy method.",Success
"Diagnostic characteristics of child bipolar I disorder: does the ""Treatment of Early Age Mania (team)"" sample generalize?",yes,"NO.

Rationale: The study found that the TEAM RCT sample had a higher prevalence of many mania symptoms, ultradian rapid cycling, psychosis, and suicidality compared to the Phenomenology sample obtained by consecutive new case ascertainment. This suggests that the TEAM sample may not be representative of the general population of children with bipolar I disorder, and therefore, may not generalize to all cases of child bipolar I disorder.",Success
Estimation of basal metabolic rate in Chinese: are the current prediction equations applicable?,yes,NO.,Success
Dementia and aphasia in motor neuron disease: an underrecognised association?,yes,YES.,Success
Does solid culture for tuberculosis influence clinical decision making in India?,maybe,"YES.

Rationale: The study found that despite the availability of culture results, treatment decisions were not significantly influenced, with only 2 patients (1.3%) initiating treatment based on positive culture results. Additionally, none of the culture-negative patients discontinued treatment. Furthermore, even with DST results, treatment was modified in only 4 patients (3.4%). This suggests that solid culture for tuberculosis has limited impact on clinical decision making in this setting.",Success
Diffusion-weighted echo-planar MR imaging of primary parotid gland tumors: is a prediction of different histologic subtypes possible?,yes,YES.,Success
Multidisciplinary breast cancer clinics. Do they work?,yes,"YES. According to the study, the multidisciplinary breast cancer clinic (MDBCC) improved patient satisfaction and decreased the time between diagnosis and treatment initiation, suggesting that it is an effective model of care for breast cancer patients.",Success
Is the international normalised ratio (INR) reliable?,maybe,"NO.

Rationale: The study found a correlation coefficient of 0.96 between INR results obtained in general practice and the reference hospital laboratory, indicating good correlation. However, the correlation coefficients with other standard laboratory techniques ranged from 0.86 to 0.92, suggesting some variability. Moreover, up to 53% of tests would have resulted in clinically significant differences in warfarin dosing depending on the site and method of testing, and the practice-derived results showed a positive bias ranging from 0.28 to 1.55. This suggests that INR results may not be entirely reliable and can vary depending on the testing site and method.",Success
"Are there associations of health status, disease activity and damage in SLE patients?",yes,"YES. According to the study, there are associations between health status and disease activity/damage in SLE patients. Specifically, increased disease activity (measured by BILAG) is correlated with reduced physical function, and greater disease damage (measured by SDI) is correlated with reduced role function due to emotional limitations.",Success
"Is gastric electrical stimulation superior to standard pharmacologic therapy in improving GI symptoms, healthcare resources, and long-term health care benefits?",yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that patients with gastroparesis treated with gastric electrical stimulation (GES) showed more sustained improvement in GI symptoms over 36 months compared to those treated with medical therapy (MED). Additionally, GES patients had significant improvements in healthcare resource utilization and decreased costs at 12, 24, and 36 months, whereas MED patients demonstrated further deterioration. Although both groups had reduced hospital days, the mortality rate was higher in the MED group, with three deaths attributed to i.v. access-related problems, whereas none of the GES patients died. These findings suggest that GES is superior to standard pharmacologic therapy in improving GI symptoms, healthcare resources, and long-term healthcare benefits.",Success
Should pulp chamber pulpotomy be seen as a permanent treatment?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study shows that at 24 months, the survival rate without any complementary treatment was 82%, indicating that 18% of the treated teeth required additional treatment, including root canal treatment or prosthetic reasons. This suggests that pulp chamber pulpotomy may not be a permanent solution for all cases, and further treatment may be necessary in some instances.",Success
Does transverse apex coincide with coronal apex levels (regional or global) in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, the regional and global apexes coincided with the transverse apex (most rotated vertebral level) in only 54.5% of the curves, and within half a level in another 45.4%. This indicates that there is a significant variability between the transverse apex and coronal apex levels, with a range of up to two levels.",Success
Does the Child Health Computing System adequately identify children with cerebral palsy?,no,"No.

Rationale: According to the study, 47% of children with cerebral palsy recorded on the Northern Ireland Cerebral Palsy Register (NICPR) were not found on the Child Health Computing System (CHCS), indicating a significant gap in identification. Additionally, 6% of cases identified on the CHCS were found not to have cerebral palsy on follow-up, suggesting potential errors in diagnosis or recording. These findings suggest that the CHCS does not adequately identify children with cerebral palsy.",Success
Are we seeing the effects of public awareness campaigns?,maybe,"YES. The study's findings suggest that the proportion of thin (0-1 mm) melanomas has increased over the 10-year period, while the proportion of thicker melanomas (1-2 mm and 2-4 mm) has decreased. This trend is consistent with the expected outcome of successful public awareness campaigns, which aim to promote early detection and diagnosis of skin cancer. The significant increase in thin melanomas, which are more likely to be diagnosed at an early stage, suggests that the campaigns may have contributed to improved awareness and detection of skin cancer among the population.",Success
Does nuchal translucency thickness in the first trimester predict GDM onset during pregnancy?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, there was no significant difference in NT values between the study group (GDM) and control group (physiological pregnancy), with a p-value of 0.585, indicating that NT thickness in the first trimester does not predict GDM onset during pregnancy.",Success
Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma: really an early stage?,no,"NO.

Rationale: Although Stage I non-small cell lung carcinoma is considered an early stage, the 5-year survival rate of 63% in this study suggests that even at this stage, the prognosis is not uniformly good. The presence of significant prognostic factors such as histology, tumor size, and resection margin status also indicates that there is still significant heterogeneity in outcomes within this stage.",Success
Cold knife conization vs. LEEP. Are they the same procedure?,no,NO.,Success
Updating emotional content in working memory: a depression-specific deficit?,yes,YES.,Success
The effect of an intracerebroventricular injection of metformin or AICAR on the plasma concentrations of melatonin in the ewe: potential involvement of AMPK?,yes,"Yes, the intracerebroventricular injection of metformin or AICAR reduces the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion in ewes, suggesting potential involvement of AMPK.",Success

In vivo visualization of pyloric mucosal hypertrophy in infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: is there an etiologic role?,yes,YES.,Success
Does high blood pressure reduce the risk of chronic low back pain?,yes,"Maybe. 

Rationale: The study found an inverse relationship between blood pressure and chronic low back pain in women, suggesting that higher blood pressure may be associated with a lower risk of developing low back pain. However, the results were equivocal in men, and no associations were found in individuals who already had low back pain at baseline. Therefore, a definitive answer cannot be provided, and further research is needed to clarify the relationship between blood pressure and chronic low back pain.",Success
Does responsibility affect the public's valuation of health care interventions?,maybe,YES.,Success
Nasal fractures:  is closed reduction satisfying?,yes,"YES. According to the study, 65% of patients were satisfied with the result of closed reduction for nasal fractures.",Success
Does spontaneous remission occur in polyarteritis nodosa?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The case presented describes a patient with symptoms and laboratory findings consistent with polyarteritis nodosa, who experienced spontaneous remission of her clinical and biological symptoms within 2 weeks of admission, without the use of immunosuppressive treatment. This suggests that, in some cases, spontaneous remission can occur in polyarteritis nodosa.",Success

Do approved doctors and medical referees in the UK agree when assessing a seafarer's fitness?,no,No.,Success
Can mental imagery functional magnetic resonance imaging predict recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that in patients with a vegetative state (VS), the presence of significant activation in regions of interest (ROIs) during the mental imagery fMRI paradigm was 100% sensitive and specific in predicting recovery to at least a minimally conscious state (MCS). Additionally, in patients with an MCS, the presence of activation in ROIs was 85% sensitive in predicting emergence from the MCS. These results suggest that mental imagery fMRI can be a useful tool in predicting recovery in patients with disorders of consciousness.",Success
The nurse cystoscopist: a feasible option?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study showed that the trained UNP had a high level of agreement with the consultant urologist in detecting bladder tumors during flexible cystoscopy, with a Kappa value of 0.94 indicating very close agreement. The fact that only one minute tumor was missed by the UNP suggests that they are a reliable option for performing flexible cystoscopy.",Success
Is cardiovascular evaluation necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy for infantile hemangiomas?,no,"YES. 

Rationale: Although the study found that ECG abnormalities were present in 6.5% of patients, none of these abnormalities were contraindications to beta-blocker therapy, and no major complications occurred. Additionally, hypotension was reported in 9 patients, but it did not require therapy adjustment. However, the study still suggests that cardiovascular evaluation is necessary prior to and during beta-blocker therapy, as it allows for identification of potential cardiovascular risks and monitoring for side effects. The study's findings support the importance of cardiovascular evaluation, despite the relatively small patient cohort being a limitation.",Success
Should ascitis volume and anthropometric measurements be estimated in hospitalized alcoholic cirrotics?,yes,"YES.

Rationale: The study found that ascitis volume and anthropometric measurements (such as dry BMI and arm circumference) were significantly associated with mortality and rehospitalization in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. These variables provided similar predictive value to the Child-Pugh index, which is a widely used prognostic tool in cirrhosis. Therefore, estimating ascitis volume and anthropometric measurements in hospitalized alcoholic cirrotics may provide valuable information for predicting long-term outcomes and guiding clinical decision-making.",Success
Could the extent of lymphadenectomy be modified by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in cervical cancer?,no,"Maybe.

Rationale: The study found that NACT did not significantly alter the topographical distribution patterns of lymph node metastasis in cervical cancer. However, the metastatic rates for every lymph node group declined in the NACT-responsive group, except for the deep inguinal and para-aortic lymph node groups. This suggests that NACT may have some impact on the extent of lymphadenectomy, but it is not a clear-cut conclusion. Further studies are needed to determine the extent to which NACT can modify the extent of lymphadenectomy in cervical cancer.",Success
Do Wound Cultures Give Information About the Microbiology of Blood Cultures in Severe Burn Patients?,yes,"YES. 

According to the study, 44% of blood isolates were previously documented in wound cultures, and transmission of the same pathogen from wound to blood was noted in 65% of bacteremic patients. This suggests that wound cultures can provide valuable information about the microbiology of blood cultures in severe burn patients.",Success
Systematic use of patient-rated depression severity monitoring: is it helpful and feasible in clinical psychiatry?,yes,YES.,Success
Treadmill training post stroke: are there any secondary benefits?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found significant improvements over time in the treatment group for depression, mobility, and social participation, indicating that treadmill training post-stroke has secondary benefits beyond just improving walking speed.",Success
Does lunar position influence the time of delivery?,yes,YES.,Success
Prostatic syndrome and pleural effusion: are they different diseases?,maybe,YES.,Success
Is controlled ovarian stimulation in intrauterine insemination an acceptable therapy in couples with unexplained non-conception in the perspective of multiple pregnancies?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, although controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) with intrauterine insemination (IUI) did not show a significant difference in ongoing pregnancy rates based on the number of follicles, it did increase the risk of multiple pregnancies. Specifically, 12 out of 73 pregnancies were multiples in women with two or more follicles. This increased risk of multiple pregnancies is a significant concern, making COS-IUI a less acceptable therapy in couples with unexplained non-conception from the perspective of multiple pregnancies.",Success
Is half-dose contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiography sufficient for the abdominal aorta and pelvis?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: Although the SNR and CNR of the abdominal aorta and common iliac artery were lower in the 0.5 mL/second groups, the differences in overall image quality across the four groups were not statistically significant. This suggests that half-dose contrast-enhanced MR angiography can still provide sufficient image quality for depicting the abdominal aorta and pelvis.",Success
Digital Tomosynthesis: A Viable Alternative to Noncontrast Computed Tomography for the Follow-Up of Nephrolithiasis?,yes,YES.,Success
High cumulative insulin exposure: a risk factor of atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetes?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found a significant positive relationship between the cumulative dose of regular insulin and carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), a measure of atherosclerosis, in patients with type 1 diabetes. This association remained significant even after adjusting for various confounding factors.",Success
Do familiar teammates request and accept more backup?,yes,YES.,Success
Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in Cushing's disease: can we predict outcome?,yes,Yes.,Success
Artefacts in 24-h pharyngeal and oesophageal pH monitoring: is simplification of pH data analysis feasible?,maybe,YES.,Success
Can the condition of the cell microenvironment of mediastinal lymph nodes help predict the risk of metastases in non-small cell lung cancer?,yes,"YES. The study suggests that the condition of the cell microenvironment of mediastinal lymph nodes, specifically the downregulation of TCR zeta chain expression in CD8(+) T cells and the reduction in the number of myeloid CD11c(+) dendritic cells, correlates with the presence of metastases in non-small cell lung cancer. Additionally, similar changes in the lymph node microenvironment were observed in lymph nodes located nearer the primary tumor, even in the absence of metastases, implying that the condition of the lymph node microenvironment may be a predictive factor for the risk of metastases.",Success
Is laparoscopic adrenalectomy safe and effective for adrenal masses larger than 7 cm?,yes,"Maybe.

Rationale: While the study reports a mean operative time of 137 min and a mean blood loss of 182 mL, which are acceptable outcomes, the rate of intraoperative complications is 16%, and 3 cases required conversion to open surgery. This suggests that LA for adrenal masses larger than 7 cm may not be entirely safe and effective in all cases. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of LA for large adrenal masses.",Success
Eyelid-parotid metastasis: do we screen for coexisting masses?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: Based on the presented cases, it is evident that primary eyelid tumors can metastasize to the parotid gland and vice versa. Therefore, it is reasonable to screen for coexisting masses in the eyelid and parotid gland, especially in patients with a history of malignancy in either location, to ensure early detection and timely management of potential metastases.",Success
Does context matter for the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, despite expecting to find spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between deprivation and mortality, the results showed that the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality did not vary between regions in any of the models. This suggests that contextual differences in the West vs. the rest of Scotland do not influence the relationship between deprivation and mortality.",Success
School food policy at Dutch primary schools: room for improvement?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: Although most principals reported having a written food policy, the rules were often not clearly defined. Additionally, there were differences in opinion between teachers/principals and parents regarding responsibilities for promoting healthy eating habits, and a significant proportion of parents believed the school should enforce the policy more strongly. These findings suggest that there is room for improvement in the school food policy and its implementation.",Success
Is the atopy patch test with house dust mites specific for atopic dermatitis?,yes,NO.,Success
Juvenile osteochondritis dissecans: is it a growth disturbance of the secondary physis of the epiphysis?,yes,"YES. The study found a significant difference in secondary physeal disruption between juvenile OCD condyles and unaffected condyles, suggesting that juvenile OCD may result from an insult affecting endochondral ossification from the secondary physis, which is responsible for epiphysial growth.",Success
Do preoperative statins reduce atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting?,yes,"YES. According to the study, preoperative statin therapy was associated with a significantly lower incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (16% vs 33%, p = 0.005) and was identified as an independent predictor of AF development after CABG (odds ratio 0.327, 95% CI 0.107 to 0.998, p = 0.05).",Success
Is there a uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile during the implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle?,maybe,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, only 6 out of 43 analyzed genes showed a statistically uniform expression among patients who subsequently became pregnant, indicating that the majority of genes did not exhibit a uniform expression profile.",Success
Can we rely on arterial line sampling in performing activated plasma thromboplastin time after cardiac surgery?,no,"No.

Rationale: The study found that the median arterial APTT ratio value was significantly higher than the median peripheral APTT ratio value, indicating heparin contamination in arterial line samples. This was further confirmed by thromboelastogram analysis, which showed a higher R-value for arterial catheter blood samples without heparinase. This suggests that arterial line sampling may not provide accurate APTT results due to heparin contamination, and therefore, cannot be relied upon for performing activated plasma thromboplastin time after cardiac surgery.",Success
Can multiple SNP testing in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers be used to improve risk prediction models in conjunction with clinical assessment?,no,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that incorporating a validated susceptibility SNP score into risk models, in conjunction with clinical and demographic variables, improved the predictive ability of the models in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 female carriers. The average 1 - c-index values, which measure the predictive accuracy of the models, were 0.221 and 0.215 for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, respectively, indicating a significant improvement in risk prediction.",Success
Does automatic transmission improve driving behavior in older drivers?,yes,"YES. According to the study, automatic transmission improved the driving behavior of older drivers, as demonstrated by safer speed adjustment in urban areas, greater maneuvering skills, safer lane position, and driving in accordance with speed regulations.",Success
Birth characteristics and risk of low intellectual performance in early adulthood: are the associations confounded by socioeconomic factors in adolescence or familial effects?,no,No.,Success
Is scintigraphy a guideline method in determining amputation levels in diabetic foot?,yes,"NO.

Rationale: While the study suggests that 3-phase bone scintigraphy may be a useful tool in determining amputation levels in diabetic foot, it is not a widely accepted or established guideline method for this purpose. The study is a small, single-center study with a limited sample size, and its results may not be generalizable to other populations. Additionally, the study does not compare the effectiveness of scintigraphy with other methods, such as clinical evaluation or other imaging modalities, in determining amputation levels. Therefore, it is not sufficient to establish scintigraphy as a guideline method for determining amputation levels in diabetic foot.",Success
Do symptoms matter when considering patients for phase I clinical trials?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that older adults with more than 3 symptoms had more hospital admissions, complications, and a greater decline in functional status, indicating that symptoms are an important consideration when evaluating patients for phase I clinical trials.",Success
Do episodic migraineurs selectively attend to headache-related visual stimuli?,no,"NO. 

Rationale: The study found no within-group differences in reaction time latencies to headache vs happy conditions among episodic migraineurs, and no between-group differences in attentional bias indices for headache-related stimuli between episodic migraineurs and non-migraine controls. This suggests that episodic migraineurs do not selectively attend to headache-related visual stimuli.",Success
Mitral replacement or repair for functional mitral regurgitation in dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy: is it really the same?,no,NO.,Success
Do nontriploid partial hydatidiform moles exist?,no,NO.,Success
Is cholecystectomy really an indication for concomitant splenectomy in mild hereditary spherocytosis?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study's policy was to only perform concomitant splenectomy if indicated for hematological reasons, not solely due to planned cholecystectomy. The results showed that only 3 out of 16 patients required splenectomy for hematological reasons, and the remaining 13 patients with retained spleens remained well and transfusion-independent during follow-up. This suggests that cholecystectomy alone is sufficient in mild hereditary spherocytosis, and concomitant splenectomy is not necessarily indicated.",Success
Does surgery or radiation therapy impact survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers?,yes,"YES. According to the study, surgery and/or radiation therapy significantly improved median, 5-year, and 10-year survival for patients with EPSCC, particularly for those with gastrointestinal disease, and multivariate analysis revealed that surgery and radiation were independent predictors of survival.",Success
MR Diagnosis of Bone Metastases at 1.5 T and 3 T: Can STIR Imaging Be Omitted?,yes,YES.,Success
Do prerecorded lecture VODcasts affect lecture attendance of first-yearpre-clinical Graduate Entry to Medicine students?,no,No.,Success
Is there an intrauterine influence on obesity?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found that the strength of association between parental BMI and offspring BMI at age 7.5 was similar for both mothers and fathers, suggesting that the influence of maternal BMI on offspring BMI is not stronger than the influence of paternal BMI. This contradicts the hypothesis that an intrauterine environment influenced by maternal BMI has a significant impact on offspring obesity.",Success
Is cytokeratin immunoreactivity useful in the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: According to the study, the Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern was observed in 77.8% of cases with short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, with a sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 77.5%. These results suggest that cytokeratin immunoreactivity can be a useful diagnostic tool for short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in the Korean population.",Success
Is routine dissection of the station 9 lymph nodes really necessary for primary lung cancer?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, the metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower (3.45%) compared to other mediastinal stations, and the staging results of most patients (99.63%) would not be impaired if station 9 nodes were not dissected. Additionally, the metastasis status of station 9 had no significant influence on survival. These findings suggest that routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary for primary lung cancer.",Success
Cutaneous melanoma in a multiethnic population: is this a different disease?,maybe,YES.,Success
Does somatostatin confer insulinostatic effects of neuromedin u in the rat pancreas?,yes,YES.,Success
Application of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in MR-mammography (MRM): do we really need whole lesion time curve distribution analysis?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, the combined dynamic data (including whole lesion time curve distribution analysis) had the highest diagnostic accuracy (84.3 +/- 4.2%), but the differences between the most suspect curve, curve-type distribution percentage, and combined dynamic data did not achieve statistical significance. This suggests that whole lesion time curve distribution analysis may not provide significantly additional diagnostic value compared to other parameters.",Success
Vaccine protection in the elderly: are Austrian seniors adequately protected by vaccinations?,no,No.,Success
Vitamin D supplementation and regulatory T cells in apparently healthy subjects: vitamin D treatment for autoimmune diseases?,yes,"Yes, vitamin D supplementation increases the frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in apparently healthy subjects, which may have implications for the prevention or treatment of autoimmune diseases.",Success

Does elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae decrease peripheral thrombophlebitis?,yes,"YES. According to the study, elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours significantly decreased the incidence of peripheral venous thrombophlebitis (PVT) from 100% in the control group to 9.5% in the study group (p<0.0001).",Success
Risk factors for major depression during midlife among a community sample of women with and without prior major depression: are they the same or different?,no,No.,Success
Starting insulin in type 2 diabetes: continue oral hypoglycemic agents?,yes,YES.,Success
Clinical identifiers for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis: are we seeing the real picture?,no,"NO.

The study aimed to validate clinical identifiers for early-stage adhesive capsulitis but found that only one identifier, pain at the end of range of all measured active movements, was associated with a positive anesthetic response (PAR). However, this identifier was associated with reduced odds of a PAR, which is counterintuitive. The lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosing early-stage adhesive capsulitis remains a significant limitation, making it challenging to establish reliable clinical identifiers. Therefore, we are not seeing the real picture yet.",Success
"Does delaying surgery in immature adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients with progressive curve, lead to addition of fusion levels?",yes,YES.,Success
Empiric treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection with fluoroquinolones in older women in Israel: another lost treatment option?,maybe,Yes.,Success
Can EMS Providers Provide Appropriate Tidal Volumes in a Simulated Adult-sized Patient with a Pediatric-sized Bag-Valve-Mask?,yes,YES.,Success
"Recovery Outcome Measures: Is There a Place for Culture, Attitudes, and Faith?",yes,"YES.

Rationale: The Recovery Knowledge Inventory (RKI) and Recovery Attitudes Questionnaire (RAQ) are widely used tools to assess recovery outcomes in mental health care. However, the utilization of these measures in southeastern Australia highlighted the importance of considering cultural, attitudinal, and faith-related factors in supporting the recovery journey of individuals with mental illness, particularly in secular multicultural societies. This suggests that incorporating cultural, attitudinal, and faith-related aspects into recovery outcome measures can provide a more comprehensive understanding of an individual's recovery process and improve overall mental health outcomes.",Success
Advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma in Thai women: should we continue to offer second-look laparotomy?,no,No.,Success
Is high-sensitivity C-reactive protein associated with carotid atherosclerosis in healthy Koreans?,no,No.,Success
Validation of the 2009 TNM version in a large multi-institutional cohort of patients treated for renal cell carcinoma: are further improvements needed?,yes,"No, the study did not validate the 2009 TNM version, as it actually assessed the recently released edition of the TNM staging system (not specified which year, but assumed to be a newer version than 2009).",Success
Are interstitial fluid concentrations of meropenem equivalent to plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, the median ISF peak concentrations (13.6 mg/L) were significantly lower than the median plasma peak concentrations (40.7 mg/L) during Profile A, indicating that ISF concentrations of meropenem are not equivalent to plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy.",Success
Do older men benefit from curative therapy of localized prostate cancer?,yes,"YES. According to the study, older men (>/= 65 years) with localized prostate cancer benefit from curative therapy (radical prostatectomy or external beam radiotherapy) in terms of life expectancy (LE) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) gains, depending on tumor differentiation and comorbidity status.",Success

Does invasive diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia during off-hours delay treatment?,no,"No. According to the study, the overall time from bronchoalveolar lavage to antibiotic administration was shorter for off-hours than day-shifts, indicating that invasive diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia during off-hours does not delay treatment.",Success
Undescended testes: does age at orchiopexy affect survival of the testis?,no,"Maybe. 

Rationale: The study found that testicular atrophy was highest for orchiopexy performed between 13-24 months of age, but after adjusting for testicular location, age was not statistically significant with postsurgical atrophy. This suggests that the association between age at orchiopexy and testicular survival is influenced by other factors, such as testicular location, and the relationship is not straightforward.",Success
Does family practice at residency teaching sites reflect community practice?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that the patient characteristics, reasons for visit, and diagnoses at the residency training sites were similar to those reported in the NAMCS for family physicians and general practitioners, suggesting that family practice at residency teaching sites reflects community practice. Although there were some differences in the services offered and requested, the overall similarity in patient demographics and visit characteristics supports this conclusion.",Success

Are endometrial polyps from pre-menopausal women similar to post-menopausal women?,no,No.,Success
Does accompanying metabolic syndrome contribute to heart dimensions in hypertensive patients?,maybe,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) had a greater left atrial diameter compared to those without MetS, and left atrial diameter was correlated with the number of MetS criteria. This suggests that accompanying MetS contributes to heart dimensions, specifically left atrial diameter, in hypertensive patients.",Success
Do hospitals provide lower quality care on weekends?,yes,"YES. According to the study, weekend hospitalization is associated with a significant reduction in immediate intensive cardiac procedures, such as cardiac catheterization, angioplasty, and bypass surgery, and a significant increase in adverse health outcomes, including 1-year mortality and readmission rates for congestive heart failure. This suggests that hospitals may provide lower quality care on weekends, at least for patients with acute myocardial infarction.",Success
Screening History Among Women with Invasive Cervical Cancer in an Academic Medical Center: Will We Miss Cancers Following Updated Guidelines?,no,"Based on the study, here are the answers to potential questions:

Q1: Is the mean time from normal Pap to diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma (IAC) shorter in patients younger than 30 years of age compared to patients aged 30 and older?
Answer: YES (15 months vs. 56 months, p < 0.001)

Q2: Is the mean time from normal Pap to diagnosis of invasive squamous cell carcinoma (ISCC) shorter in patients younger than 30 years of age compared to patients aged 30 and older?
Answer: YES (38 months vs. 82 months, p = 0.018)

Q3: Will the updated guidelines for Pap testing potentially miss cancers, especially among women younger than 30 years of age?
Answer: MAYBE (The study suggests that the time from normal Pap to diagnosis of invasive cervical cancer is shorter in women younger than 30, which may imply that the updated guidelines could potentially miss cancers in this age group. However, more research is needed to confirm this finding.)",Success
Oral mucocele/ranula: Another human immunodeficiency virus-related salivary gland disease?,yes,YES.,Success
Is there an increase in the incidence of gbs carrier rates among pregnant women in northern Israel?,yes,"NO.

Rationale: The study found a GBS carrier rate of 16% among pregnant women in the western Galilee in Israel, which is within the expected range of 4-40% reported in the literature. There is no indication of an increase in the incidence of GBS carrier rates among pregnant women in northern Israel.",Success

Steroids in aminoglycoside-containing ear drops: do they reduce cochlear toxicity?,yes,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, the combination of gentamicin and betamethasone (GM/BM) did not cause significant additional hearing loss compared to the untreated ears, suggesting that betamethasone did not reduce the cochlear toxicity of otic gentamicin. In fact, betamethasone alone even caused a significant degree of hearing loss.",Success
Does having a regular primary care clinician improve quality of preventive care for young children?,yes,YES.,Success
Is it time to reconsider lobectomy in low-risk paediatric thyroid cancer?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that 53.4% of patients met the American Thyroid Association's low-risk criteria, and 21.9% met the more stringent ""very-low-risk"" criteria. Notably, all patients in the ""very-low-risk"" group had an excellent response to initial therapy without recurrence or persistence after a mean follow-up of 36.4 months. This suggests that a subset of children with well-differentiated thyroid cancer may be adequately treated with lobectomy, rather than total thyroidectomy, which is currently the recommended treatment. The study's findings support reconsidering lobectomy as a viable treatment option for low-risk paediatric thyroid cancer.",Success
Do preoperative serum C-reactive protein levels predict the definitive pathological stage in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer?,no,No.,Success
After CLASS--Is a voluntary public insurance program a realistic way to meet the long-term support and service needs of adults with disabilities?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found that only 1.8% of middle-aged adults were willing to pay $100 per month or more for PAS insurance, which suggests that a voluntary public insurance program may not be a realistic way to meet the long-term support and service needs of adults with disabilities due to high premium costs and potential issues with enrollment and adverse selection, as seen with the CLASS Act.",Success
The secular growth acceleration: does it appear during fetal life?,no,No.,Success
Does hippocampal atrophy on MRI predict cognitive decline?,no,"NO. According to the study, no significant differences in rate of cognitive decline were found between subjects with or without hippocampal atrophy (HCA) on MRI.",Success
Chemoradiotherapy in the management of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma esophagus: is surgical resection required?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found no significant difference in overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and 2-year survival probability between the surgery arm (arm A) and the chemoradiotherapy alone arm (arm B). Although the probability of loco-regional recurrence was higher in arm B, the primary endpoint of OS was not improved with the addition of surgery. Therefore, based on this study, surgical resection may not be required for the management of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus when treated with chemoradiotherapy.",Success
Bridge experience with long-term implantable left ventricular assist devices. Are they an alternative to transplantation?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study presents a medium-term experience with LVADs as bridges to transplantation, demonstrating a 74% survival rate and manageable complications, such as right ventricular failure and infection. The results suggest that long-term implantable LVADs could be a viable alternative to transplantation, especially with the creation of appropriately designed trials to address permanent device implantation.",Success
Lloyd-Davies position with Trendelenburg--a disaster waiting to happen?,yes,YES.,Success
Is patient outcome compromised during the initial experience with robot-assisted radical cystectomy?,no,No.,Success
Appendectomy timing: Will delayed surgery increase the complications?,no,"NO. According to the study, ETA (time from emergency room registration to appendectomy) was not a significant predictor of perforation or postoperative complications.",Success
Treatment of vitamin D deficiency in CKD patients with ergocalciferol: are current K/DOQI treatment guidelines adequate?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found that only 25% of patients achieved a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level ≥30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l) after 6 months of treatment with ergocalciferol, and only 26% of patients had a ≥30% decrease in their iPTH level. This suggests that the K/DOQI recommended doses of ergocalciferol may not be adequate for correcting vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients.",Success
Comparing femoral version after intramedullary nailing performed by trauma-trained and non-trauma trained surgeons: is there a difference?,no,"NO. According to the study, there was no statistically significant difference in post-operative femoral version between trauma-trained and non-trauma trained surgeons (p>0.05).",Success
Will clinical studies elucidate the connection between the length of storage of transfused red blood cells and clinical outcomes?,no,"Maybe.

Rationale: The study suggests that the power of RCTs to detect a significant association between RBC storage duration and clinical outcomes is critically dependent on various factors, including the categorization of RBC storage time, the temporal pattern of the biologic mechanism, and the age distribution of RBCs in the inventory. For most combinations of these factors, the power of RCTs to detect a significant treatment effect was below 80%. This implies that clinical studies may not be able to elucidate the connection between RBC storage duration and clinical outcomes unless these factors are carefully considered and controlled for.",Success
Pitfalls in urinary stone identification using CT attenuation values: are we getting the same information on different scanner models?,no,"NO, we are not getting the same information on different scanner models.

Rationale: The study found significant differences in mean CT attenuation values for some stone types between different CT scanner models, even at the same energy level (80kV or 120kV). Additionally, the t-paired test showed that most stone types could not be identified based on CT attenuation values, and large overlappings between stone types were observed. This suggests that the CT attenuation values obtained from different scanner models may not be directly comparable, and stone identification may be scanner-dependent.",Success
Immunohistochemical assessment of steroid hormone receptors in tissues of the anal canal. Implications for anal incontinence?,yes,"Yes, the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the anal canal tissues suggests a potential hormonal influence on anal continence in women.",Success
Is acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia the expression of immune dysregulation?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The patient's response to immunosuppressive therapy, which led to a considerable diminution of the lung lesions, suggests that AFOP may be an expression of immune dysregulation. Additionally, the underlying condition of very severe aplastic anemia, which is also an immune-mediated disorder, further supports this notion.",Success
Do inhaled corticosteroids affect perception of dyspnea during bronchoconstriction in asthma?,yes,YES.,Success
Does angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 (ACE-1) gene polymorphism lead to chronic kidney disease among hypertensive patients?,yes,"YES. 

The study found that the D allele of the ACE-1 gene was associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) among hypertensive patients, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.25 (95% CI = 0.86-1.79). Additionally, the DD genotype of the ACE-1 gene was associated with increased total and HDL cholesterol levels, which are also risk factors for CKD. These findings suggest that ACE-1 gene polymorphism is a risk factor for CKD among hypertensive patients.",Success
Does laparoscopic antireflux surgery improve quality of life in patients whose gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is well controlled with medical therapy?,yes,YES.,Success
Is semi-closed endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery combined with a short venous bypass in case of insufficient venous material an acceptable alternative for limb-threatening ischemia?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study's results show a cumulative primary patency rate of 60.3% at 1 year and 48.4% at 3 years, and a limb salvage rate of 68.6% at 1 and 3 years, indicating that this procedure can be an effective alternative for limb-threatening ischemia in patients with insufficient venous material.",Success
Cue-induced behavioural activation: a novel model of alcohol craving?,yes,YES.,Success
Can routine offering of influenza vaccination in office-based settings reduce racial and ethnic disparities in adult influenza vaccination?,yes,YES.,Success
Can implant retention be recommended for treatment of infected TKA?,maybe,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, the infection control rate was lower in the retention group (31%) compared to the removal group (59%) after initial surgical treatment, and even at the latest follow-up, the infection control rate was still lower in the retention group (81%) compared to the removal group (91%). Additionally, the study identified type of treatment (retention versus removal) as the only factor associated with infection control, suggesting that removal is a more effective approach.",Success
Long-term significance of postictal psychotic episodes II. Are they predictive of interictal psychotic episodes?,yes,"Based on the study, here is the answer to the question:

Are postictal psychotic episodes (PIPE) predictive of the development of interictal psychotic episodes (IPE)?

Maybe. 

Rationale: Although the univariate logistic regression analysis showed that a history of PIPE was a significant predictor of IPE (P=0.006), this significance disappeared when entered into a multivariate analysis, suggesting that PIPE may not be an independent predictor of IPE.",Success
Do primary care physicians underprescribe antibiotics for peptic ulcer disease?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: According to the study, only 27.6% of patients with PUD received eradication therapy, which is a relatively low percentage considering that Helicobacter pylori eradication is a recommended treatment for PUD. Additionally, the study highlights that only 37.7% of PUD patients with a definitive diagnosis received eradication therapy, suggesting that even in cases with a clear diagnosis, antibiotics were not prescribed as frequently as they should be.",Success
Chronic progressive cervical myelopathy with HTLV-I infection: Variant form of HAM/TSP?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The presence of anti-HTLV-I antibodies in both serum and CSF, along with the clinical and neuroradiologic findings, suggests a strong association between HTLV-I infection and the development of chronic progressive cervical myelopathy in these patients. The inflammatory changes in the spinal cord lesion and demyelinating polyneuropathy in some patients further support this connection. Additionally, the high risk of developing HAM/TSP in two of the three patients examined based on virologic and immunologic aspects implies that this condition may be a variant form of HAM/TSP.",Success
Gender difference in survival of resected non-small cell lung cancer: histology-related phenomenon?,yes,YES.,Success
Preservation of the PCL when performing cruciate-retaining TKA: Is the tibial tuberosity a reliable predictor of the PCL footprint location?,yes,YES.,Success
The English antibiotic awareness campaigns: did they change the public's knowledge of and attitudes to antibiotic use?,no,No.,Success
Does topical N-acetylcysteine application after myringotomy cause severe otorrhea?,yes,"YES. According to the study, in the NAC group, the remaining ears (60% of the perforations) exhibited otorrhea by the third day, indicating that topical N-acetylcysteine application after myringotomy can cause severe otorrhea.",Success
Is intrapartum vibroacoustic stimulation an effective predictor of fetal acidosis?,yes,"YES. The study found an excellent association between the acceleration response to VAS and pH ≥ 7.20, and between a negative response to VAS and pH < 7.20, in both the first and second stages of labor. The negative VAS response was a significant predictor of fetal acidosis (pH < 7.20) with a high odds ratio (10.6) and a positive predictive value of 67%.",Success
Must early postoperative oral intake be limited to laparoscopy?,no,NO.,Success
Does loss of consciousness predict neuropsychological decrements after concussion?,no,"No. According to the study, no significant differences were found between the LOC, no LOC, or uncertain LOC groups for any of the neuropsychological measures used, suggesting that loss of consciousness does not predict neuropsychological decrements after concussion.",Success
Does patella position influence ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that patella position significantly affects ligament balancing in total knee arthroplasty, particularly in knee flexion position. The gaps measured in patella eversion were smaller compared to patella reduction, with a statistically significant difference observed in the lateral gap (p<0.05). Additionally, a significant portion of knees (24% in patella subluxation and 66% in patella eversion) demonstrated changes in gap measurements in knee flexion position compared to patella reduction, indicating that patella position influences ligament balancing.",Success
Is the advanced age a contraindication to GERD laparoscopic surgery?,no,NO.,Success
Has the 80-hour workweek improved surgical resident education in New England?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, only 25% of programs felt that surgical education was improved after the implementation of the 80-hour workweek, whereas 31% felt education was worse, and 44% believed there was no difference. Additionally, there was no significant difference observed in ABSITE scores and first-time pass rates of the ABS examination before or after the introduction of the 80-hour workweek. This suggests that the 80-hour workweek did not have a positive impact on surgical resident education in New England.",Success
Can continuous physical training counteract aging effect on myoelectric fatigue?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that fatigue indices did not differ significantly between younger and older subjects, suggesting that continuous physical training can counteract the aging effect on myoelectric fatigue in physically active individuals.",Success
Does ischemic preconditioning require reperfusion before index ischemia?,no,NO.,Success
Are polymorphisms in oestrogen receptors genes associated with lipid levels in response to hormone therapy?,yes,YES.,Success
Can dose reduction to one parotid gland prevent xerostomia?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that at a median follow-up of 13 months, only 2/19 patients had grade III xerostomia, despite the parotid gland being spared on only one side in most patients. This suggests that reducing the dose to one parotid gland can help prevent severe xerostomia. Additionally, the mean dose to the contralateral parotid gland was lower (26.85 Gy) compared to the ipsilateral gland (33.14 Gy), which may have contributed to the preservation of parotid function and reduced xerostomia.",Success
Is the histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT1) gene a candidate for schizophrenia?,no,"YES.

Rationale: The study found nominally significant differences in allele frequencies of several SNPs around the HINT1 gene region in both family-based and case-control studies, suggesting a potential association with schizophrenia. Additionally, the expression study revealed significant interactions amongst sex, diagnosis, and rs3864283 genotypes, further supporting the notion that HINT1 may play a role in schizophrenia.",Success
Does higher body mass index contribute to worse asthma control in an urban population?,no,"NO. 

Rationale: According to the study, multiple linear regression analysis showed no association between obesity or increasing BMI level and asthma control using all 4 validated asthma control questionnaires, even after adjusting for potential confounding factors. This suggests that higher BMI does not contribute to worse asthma control in this urban population.",Success
Living in an urban environment and non-communicable disease risk in Thailand: Does timing matter?,yes,YES.,Success
Does a febrile reaction to platelets predispose recipients to red blood cell alloimmunization?,yes,"YES. According to the study, the alloimmunization rate among recipients in the FTR group was significantly higher than in the control group (8% vs. 3%, respectively; p = 0.026), suggesting that a febrile reaction to platelets may predispose recipients to red blood cell alloimmunization.",Success
Maternal creatine homeostasis is altered during gestation in the spiny mouse: is this a metabolic adaptation to pregnancy?,yes,YES.,Success
Spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with resection of the splenic vessels. Should one rely on the short gastric arteries?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, perfusion of cadaveric arteries revealed no effective direct or indirect communication between the left gastric and short gastric arteries. Additionally, intraoperative color Doppler ultrasound and CT angiography did not detect any significant hilar arterial blood flow or short gastric vessels supplying the spleen after clamping or resection of the splenic vessels. Instead, the gastroepiploic arcade was found to be the main arterial pathway feeding the spleen. Therefore, relying solely on the short gastric arteries for splenic perfusion during a spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with resection of the splenic vessels is not supported by the evidence.",Success
Delayed peripheral facial palsy in the stapes surgery: can it be prevented?,yes,"YES.

Rationale: The study suggests that delayed peripheral facial palsy in stapes surgery may be associated with a history of recurrent labial herpetic lesions and increased IgG antibody titers against HSV-1. Since acyclovir therapy led to complete recovery in 6 out of 7 patients, it is possible that prophylactic antiviral therapy in patients with a history of recurrent labial herpetic lesions may prevent or reduce the incidence of delayed facial palsy in stapes surgery.",Success
Staging laparoscopy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: is it useful?,no,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that staging laparoscopy (SL) changed the treatment strategy for 7% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by preventing unnecessary open exploration, and an additional 17% of patients had changes in management due to biopsy of the contralateral liver.",Success
Can echocardiography and ECG discriminate hereditary transthyretin V30M amyloidosis from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?,yes,YES.,Success
Nasal polyposis: is there an inheritance pattern?,yes,"YES. 

The study found a significantly higher prevalence of nasal polyposis (19.7%) in the family members older than 17 years compared to the national French prevalence (2.1%), suggesting a possible hereditary factor.",Success
Pharmacologic regimens for knee osteoarthritis prevention: can they be cost-effective?,yes,"Maybe. 

Rationale: The study found that pharmacologic regimens for knee osteoarthritis prevention can be cost-effective in high-risk populations (obese with a history of knee injury), but not in lower-risk populations (obese only, knee injury only, or no risk factors). The cost-effectiveness of these regimens depends on the target population, drug efficacy, toxicity, and cost. In the high-risk cohort, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $118,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, which is close to but below the typical US cost-effectiveness threshold of $150,000 per QALY. However, regimens priced at $3,000 per year or higher were not cost-effective.",Success
Production of chemokines by perivascular adipose tissue: a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study suggests that perivascular white adipose tissue (pWAT) produces chemokines, such as interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, which induce the chemotaxis of peripheral blood leukocytes, including granulocytes, monocytes, and activated T cells. The accumulation of macrophages and T cells at the interface between pWAT and the adventitia of human atherosclerotic aortas supports the role of pWAT-derived chemokines in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.",Success
Household and food shopping environments: do they play a role in socioeconomic inequalities in fruit and vegetable consumption?,no,No.,Success
Does birth center care during a woman's first pregnancy have any impact on her future reproduction?,no,"NO. 

Rationale: According to the study, there was no statistical difference found between the birth center care group and the standard care group in terms of time to second birth, with median times of 2.85 and 2.82 years, respectively (p=0.26). This suggests that birth center care during a woman's first pregnancy does not have a significant impact on her future reproduction, specifically in terms of the timing of her second birth.",Success
Could Adult European Pharmacoresistant Epilepsy Patients Be Treated With Higher Doses of Zonisamide?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study suggests that high doses of zonisamide (>500 mg/d) can be effective and tolerable in adult patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, with 55% of patients experiencing >50% seizure reduction. Although adverse events were observed in 37% of patients, good tolerance to high doses of other antiepileptic drugs was observed in 66% of patients. Additionally, the available plasma levels of ZNS were within the therapeutic range. These findings support the possibility of treating adult European pharmacoresistant epilepsy patients with higher doses of zonisamide.",Success
Does early migraine treatment shorten time to headache peak and reduce its severity?,yes,"**No**

Rationale: According to the study, early intervention was associated with a shorter time from headache onset to peak, but it did not reduce headache severity at peak.",Success
Post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhage: is it a preferably night-time event?,yes,"YES. According to the study, 71.2% of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhages occurred during the night-time, which is a statistically significant difference (p=0.002) compared to day-time haemorrhages.",Success
Acute hepatitis C in Israel: a predominantly iatrogenic disease?,yes,"YES. According to the study, the most frequent mode of transmission (65%) was iatrogenic, involving various procedures and clinical settings, suggesting that acute hepatitis C in Israel is predominantly iatrogenic.",Success
Is Alveolar Macrophage Phagocytic Dysfunction in Children With Protracted Bacterial Bronchitis a Forerunner to Bronchiectasis?,yes,YES,Success
Do elderly patients benefit from surgery in addition to radiotherapy for treatment of metastatic spinal cord compression?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found no significant differences in motor function improvement, local control rates, and survival rates between the surgery plus radiotherapy (S + RT) group and the radiotherapy alone (RT) group, as well as in the subgroups of patients receiving direct decompressive surgery plus stabilization of involved vertebrae (DDSS) and laminectomy (LE). The p-values for all comparisons were above 0.05, indicating no statistically significant benefits of adding surgery to radiotherapy for elderly patients with metastatic spinal cord compression.",Success
Are WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks for infants of HIV-infected mothers appropriate in the South African context?,no,"NO. 

The study found that the home-prepared replacement milks containing powdered full cream milk (PM) and fresh full cream milk (FM) with different micronutrient supplements did not provide adequate amounts of essential micronutrients and fatty acids, specifically vitamins E and C, folic acid, iodine, selenium, zinc, and pantothenic acid. Additionally, the preparation time and cost of these replacement milks were significant, with the cost being approximately 20% of the average monthly income of domestic or shop workers. Therefore, the study suggests that the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF-recommended replacement milks may not be suitable for the South African context.",Success
Is minilaparoscopic inguinal hernia repair feasible?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study reported a feasibility rate of 100% for miniTAPP, with no conversions to laparoscopy or an anterior open approach required, indicating that minilaparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is a feasible procedure.",Success
Are Reviewers' Scores Influenced by Citations to Their Own Work?,yes,"NO. 

Rationale: The study found that the mean score of manuscript desirability was only 0.3 points higher for cited reviewers compared to noncited reviewers, and this difference was not statistically significant. Additionally, when adjusting for manuscript quality, the odds ratio for the manuscript desirability score was 1.4, indicating that manuscript quality was a confounder. This suggests that the reviewers' scores were not significantly influenced by citations to their own work.",Success
Does the central venous pressure predict fluid responsiveness?,no,NO.,Success
Memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT as a diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that memory-provoked rCBF-SPECT (MP-SPECT) showed a significant reduction in regional cerebral blood flow in the left parietal cortex in Alzheimer's disease patients compared to healthy elderly, whereas no significant differences were seen at rest. This suggests that MP-SPECT may be a useful diagnostic tool in differentiating between AD patients and normal controls, with increased diagnostic sensitivity compared to rCBF-SPECT at rest.",Success
Is low birth weight a risk indicator for congenital cytomegalovirus infection?,no,"NO.

Rationale: Although the study found that 50% of the newborns with congenital CMV infection (2 out of 4) had low birth weight (<2700g), the presence of CMV-DNA was not exclusive to the low birth weight group, as one of the infected newborns had a birth weight above the adopted limit (>2700g). This suggests that low birth weight is not a reliable indicator of congenital CMV infection.",Success
Is external palliative radiotherapy for gallbladder carcinoma effective?,yes,"YES.

Rationale: The presented case demonstrates that the patient with unresectable gallbladder carcinoma showed clinico-laboratory improvement and no local extension of the tumor after receiving external palliative radiotherapy. The patient also maintained a good performance status and survived for at least 1 year after diagnosis, which suggests that the radiotherapy was effective in providing palliation and improving the patient's quality of life.",Success
Is discordance in TEOAE and AABR outcomes predictable in newborns?,yes,"YES. The study found that certain maternal and infant factors, such as antenatal care status, mode of delivery, and nursery type, were associated with discordant TEOAE and AABR outcomes, and these factors can be used to predict discordance (c-statistic=0.73).",Success
Chemical shift MRI: is there any contribution to morphologic evaluation of solid breast masses?,yes,YES.,Success
Substance use and HIV-related sexual behaviors among US high school students: are they related?,yes,YES.,Success
Does sex influence the response to intravenous thrombolysis in ischemic stroke?,yes,NO.,Success
Does Paget's disease exist in India?,yes,YES.,Success
Can vaginal pH be measured from the wet mount slide?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, measuring pH from microscopy slides after adding saline leads to systematic increases in pH, resulting in false positive readings. This suggests that vaginal pH measurement from wet mount slides is not accurate and should not be relied upon.",Success
Does Molecular Genotype Provide Useful Information in the Management of Radioiodine Refractory Thyroid Cancers?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: According to the study, BRAF mutation status positively influenced median progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), suggesting that molecular genotype provides useful information in guiding therapy and predicting treatment outcomes in radioiodine-refractory thyroid cancers.",Success
Follow-up of patients with new cardiovascular implantable electronic devices: are experts' recommendations implemented in routine clinical practice?,yes,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, only 42.4% of patients had an initial in-person visit within 2 to 12 weeks, which is below the recommended frequency outlined in the 2008 expert consensus statement. Although there was an improvement in follow-up rates over time, the implementation of experts' recommendations in routine clinical practice was still suboptimal.",Success
Does limb-salvage surgery offer patients better quality of life and functional capacity than amputation?,maybe,"YES. 

Rationale: According to the study, patients undergoing limb-salvage surgery had superior Physiological Cost Index scores and Reintegration to Normal Living Index scores compared to those having above-knee amputation, indicating better functional capacity and quality of life. Although the Toronto Extremity Salvage scores and SF-36 scores were similar in both groups, the overall results suggest that limb-salvage surgery offers better quality of life and functional capacity than amputation.",Success
Cervical spine fractures in geriatric blunt trauma patients with low-energy mechanism: are clinical predictors adequate?,no,No.,Success
Do microbiological factors account for poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women in Poland?,yes,"Maybe.

Rationale: The study found that unmarried pregnant women had a higher risk of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and certain types of pathological microflora, specifically Mycoplasma hominis, which could contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes. However, the study did not directly investigate the relationship between microbiological factors and poor pregnancy outcomes. It only identified microbiological differences between married and unmarried pregnant women. Further research is needed to establish a causal link between microbiological factors and poor pregnancy outcomes among unmarried pregnant women in Poland.",Success
Should all patients be optimized to the same preoperative hemoglobin level to avoid transfusion in primary knee arthroplasty?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study suggests that the risk of transfusion is associated with poorer performance status (ASA score III/IV) and lower preoperative Hb levels. The estimated probability of transfusion varies depending on the ASA score and preoperative Hb level. This implies that a one-size-fits-all approach to optimizing preoperative Hb levels may not be appropriate, and instead, a tailored approach considering individual patient characteristics may be more effective.",Success
Is there any relation between cervical cord plaques and discopathy in patients with multiple sclerosis?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found a significant correlation between the site of cervical cord plaques and discopathy in patients with multiple sclerosis, with 69.1% of patients having cervical plaques at the same site as cervical discopathy. This suggests a relationship between the two conditions.",Success
Is the processing of affective prosody influenced by spatial attention?,maybe,"YES.

Rationale: According to the study, the effects of emotional prosody interacted with the effects of spatial attention at early processing levels (<200 ms), indicating that spatial attention does influence the processing of affective prosody. However, at later processing stages (>200 ms), the effects were additive, suggesting that spatial attention has a limited impact on the processing of affective prosody.",Success
Is there a role for leukocyte and CRP measurements in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly?,maybe,"YES. 

Rationale: Although there was no statistically significant difference in leukocyte counts or CRP values between patients with an uninflamed appendix and those with acute appendicitis, the study found that none of the patients with acute appendicitis (group B) had both unelevated leukocyte count and CRP value. This suggests that leukocyte and CRP measurements can still be useful in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the elderly, as the absence of elevation in both values may help rule out acute appendicitis.",Success
Are bipolar disorders underdiagnosed in patients with depressive episodes?,maybe,"YES. The study suggests that bipolar disorders may be underdiagnosed in patients with depressive episodes, as the prevalence of BD varied greatly depending on the diagnostic approach used, with some algorithms yielding much higher rates than others. The highest prevalence was found using the HCL-32R, which is a screening tool specifically designed to detect hypomanic symptoms, suggesting that BD may be more common in patients with depressive episodes than previously thought.",Success
Does patient-prosthesis mismatch after aortic valve replacement affect survival and quality of life in elderly patients?,no,"No. According to the study, overall survival at 5 years was not influenced by patient-prosthesis mismatch (P = NS), and quality of life (QoL) was similar between patients with and without PPM (P = NS).",Success
Does β-catenin have a role in pathogenesis of sebaceous cell carcinoma of the eyelid?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found a significant correlation between cytoplasmic overexpression of β-catenin and tumour size, orbital invasion, and pagetoid spread in sebaceous cell carcinoma of the eyelid, suggesting that β-catenin plays a role in the pathogenesis of this disease.",Success
Is ultrasound equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis?,yes,"Maybe.

Rationale: According to the study, ultrasound and X-ray had similar performances in detecting fractures, with 130 fractures identified using ultrasound and 148 using X-ray. However, X-ray had an advantage in detecting fracture type, while ultrasound was superior in identifying dislocations. Although these differences were not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing, the study suggests that ultrasound is not definitively equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis, but rather has its own strengths and weaknesses.",Success
Hearing loss: an unknown complication of pre-eclampsia?,yes,YES.,Success
Medical student education in emergency medicine: do students meet the national standards for clinical encounters of selected core conditions?,no,YES.,Success
A model of healing of Los Angeles grades C and D reflux oesophagitis: is there an optimal time of acid suppression for maximal healing?,yes,"YES. According to the study, maximal reflux oesophagitis healing rates were achieved when intragastric pH>4 was maintained for approximately 50-70% (12-17 hours) of the 24-hour period, suggesting an optimal time of acid suppression for maximal healing.",Success
Gadofosveset-enhanced MR angiography of carotid arteries: does steady-state imaging improve accuracy of first-pass imaging?,yes,"YES. According to the study, steady-state imaging improved the accuracy of first-pass imaging for both stenosis degree and plaque morphology, with significant differences (P<.001) in sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV between the two.",Success
Elephant trunk in a small-calibre true lumen for chronic aortic dissection: cause of haemolytic anaemia?,yes,YES.,Success
Can p53 alterations be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, there were no significant differences in tumour size reduction or local failure observed in the groups with p53 overexpression or p53 mutation compared with normal (wild-type p53). The average reduction in tumour size was 53% in the wild-type p53 group and 63% in the altered p53 group, but this difference was not statistically significant (P=0.18). Therefore, the study suggests that p53 alterations cannot be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer.",Success
"Laparoscopic-assisted ileocolic resections in patients with Crohn's disease: are abscesses, phlegmons, or recurrent disease contraindications?",no,No.,Success
Has the use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies by U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations changed from 2002 to 2007?,yes,YES.,Success
Is extended aortic replacement in acute type A dissection justifiable?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study suggests that complete replacement of all dissected tissue (group 1) is associated with better outcomes, including lower early mortality and perioperative cerebrovascular events, compared to incomplete replacement (group 2). This implies that extended aortic replacement in acute type A dissection may be justified to achieve better outcomes.",Success
Is intensive monitoring during the first transfusion in pediatric patients necessary?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, none of the 13 patients who experienced a reaction during their first transfusion required ICU management, and all reactions were clinically mild. This suggests that intensive monitoring during the first transfusion may not be necessary, as severe reactions requiring ICU management occurred during subsequent transfusions, not during the first transfusion.",Success
Effects of exercise training on heart rate and QT interval in healthy young individuals: are there gender differences?,yes,Yes.,Success
Is coeliac disease screening in risk groups justified?,yes,"YES.

Rationale: The study found that screen-detected coeliac patients had similar quality of life, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bone mineral density compared to symptom-detected patients and non-coeliac controls, and a high rate of dietary compliance (96%). This suggests that screening in risk groups can lead to early diagnosis and effective treatment, resulting in improved outcomes for patients.",Success
Analysis of the epidemiological pattern of Shigellosis in Barcelona between 1988 and 2012: Is it an emerging sexually transmitted infection?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found a sustained increase in shigellosis cases among males, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM), with 63% of S. flexneri cases in 2012 being MSM. This suggests a shift in the epidemiological pattern of shigellosis in Barcelona, with a growing proportion of cases attributed to sexual transmission, particularly among MSM.",Success
A patient with myelomeningocele: is untethering necessary prior to scoliosis correction?,no,"NO.

The pooled HR estimates from the meta-analysis further supported the significance of Ki-67 overexpression as a prognostic biomarker for UTUC.",Success
Chemoradiation instead of surgery to treat mid and low rectal tumors: is it safe?,no,"NO.

Rationale: Although 2 patients with complete response (CR) did not undergo surgery and remained cancer-free, 8 out of 10 patients with CR had local recurrence within 3.7 to 8.8 months, indicating that chemoradiation alone may not be sufficient to achieve durable local control. Additionally, the study's overall results suggest that surgery remains an essential component of treatment for mid and low rectal tumors.",Success
Are there effects of intrauterine cocaine exposure on delinquency during early adolescence?,no,"NO. According to the study, the level of intrauterine cocaine exposure (IUCE) was not significantly associated with delinquent behavior during early adolescence, after controlling for other prenatal exposures and psychosocial factors.",Success
Thoracic and thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair: is reimplantation of spinal cord arteries a waste of time?,yes,"NO. 

Rationale: The study suggests that serial segmental artery sacrifice during TAA/A repair did not result in paraplegia in 98% of patients, despite an average of 8.0 segmental artery pairs being sacrificed. This implies that reimplantation of spinal cord arteries may not be necessary to prevent paraplegia. However, the study also highlights the importance of intraoperative monitoring and anesthetic/blood pressure manipulation to maintain spinal cord function.",Success
Is year of radical prostatectomy a predictor of outcome in prostate cancer?,yes,"YES.

Does preloading with colloids prevent hemodynamic changes when neurosurgical patients are subsequently changed to the seated position?,yes,YES.,Success
Is there a first night effect on sleep bruxism?,no,NO.,Success
Does menopausal transition affect the quality of life?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, the menopausal transition did not influence the eight domains of the Short Form-36 in the multivariate regression model, suggesting that menopausal transition itself does not have a significant impact on quality of life. However, vasomotor symptoms were found to have an adverse influence on role limitation of emotion.",Success
Can clinicians use the PHQ-9 to assess depression in people with vision loss?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that the PHQ-9 scale demonstrated good fit to the Rasch model, unidimensionality, and satisfactory precision (person separation reliability value of 0.80) in a sample of 103 participants with low vision. These results suggest that the PHQ-9 possesses the essential psychometric characteristics to measure depressive symptoms in people with visual impairment, supporting its use by clinicians for this purpose.",Success
Preparing patients at high risk of falls for discharge home after rehabilitation: Do we meet the guidelines?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, discharge documentation correctly identified falls risk for only 9 out of 50 patients, indicating a significant gap in meeting guidelines for falls risk assessment and documentation. Additionally, the study found limited evidence of assessment for certain risk factors, such as osteoporosis, footwear, and visual assessment, and patients received a median of 6.5 out of 16 possible fall prevention strategies, suggesting that guidelines for falls risk management are not being consistently met.",Success
Some aspects of social exclusion: do they influence suicide mortality?,yes,"YES. According to the study, both the 'economic/employment' and 'social/welfare' dimensions of social exclusion have a negative influence on suicide mortality rates among both males and females.",Success
Does parity increase insulin resistance during pregnancy?,no,"Maybe.

Rationale: The study found that parity was related to decreased insulin sensitivity index (ISI(OGTT)) and increased proxy for beta-cell function (CP/FPG) in women with parity >3, suggesting a possible association between parity and insulin resistance. However, after adjusting for age, pregestational BMI, and weight gain, the relationships between parity and ISI(OGTT), CP/FPG, and GDM were no longer significant. This suggests that parity may not be an independent predictor of insulin resistance during pregnancy, and other factors such as age, BMI, and weight gain may play a more significant role.",Success
Is gastric cancer different in Korea and the United States?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found significant differences in the characteristics and prognoses of gastric cancers between Korean and U.S. subjects, including differences in tumor location, histological type, stage, and predictors of disease-specific survival.",Success
Do we need imaging to diagnose appendicitis in children?,maybe,"Maybe.

Rationale: According to the study, 82.4% of the children who underwent appendectomy did not have any preoperative imaging, suggesting that clinical assessment alone can be sufficient for diagnosis in many cases. However, the study also shows that imaging is more frequently requested in children who are admitted for observation but do not undergo surgery, implying that imaging may be useful in certain situations, such as when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of selective use of imaging studies, particularly abdominal ultrasonography, in certain age and sex groups.",Success
Does oral α-galactosidase relieve irritable bowel symptoms?,no,"Maybe. 

Rationale: The study showed a trend towards a more prominent decrease in IBS-Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS) in the α-galactosidase (AG) group, and the responder rate at week 16 was higher for the AG group. However, the difference in IBS-SSS between AG and placebo groups was not statistically significant, and there was no difference in quality of life between the two groups. Additionally, more patients in the AG group withdrew from the study due to abdominal pain and diarrhea, which could be related to the treatment. Therefore, the evidence suggests that oral α-galactosidase may have some beneficial effects on IBS symptoms, but the results are not conclusive.",Success
Does cognitive function predict frequency compressed speech recognition in listeners with normal hearing and normal cognition?,no,NO.,Success
Affect-regulated exercise intensity: does training at an intensity that feels 'good' improve physical health?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found a significant increase in the time to reach ventilatory threshold in the training group compared to the control group, indicating improved cardiovascular fitness. Although the exercise intensity was self-regulated to feel 'good' and classified as being in the lower range of the recommended guidelines, the results suggest that affect-regulated exercise training can lead to physical health gains, specifically improved cardiovascular fitness.",Success

Cancer of the buccal mucosa: are margins and T-stage accurate predictors of local control?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, the local failure rate was 66% for patients with close or positive margins and 52% for those with negative margins, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = ns). Additionally, among patients with negative margins, those with T1-T2 disease still had a 40% local failure rate with surgical resection alone, indicating that margins and T-stage are not accurate predictors of local control.",Success
Can mass drug administration lead to the sustainable control of schistosomiasis?,no,"NO.

Rationale: Despite an active schistosomiasis-control program in Northern Samar for >30 years, which included a MDA campaign in the last 5 years, the mean prevalence of schistosomiasis remained high at 27.1%. This suggests that MDA alone may not be sufficient to achieve sustainable control of schistosomiasis. Additionally, the study found high levels of schistosomiasis-induced morbidity, including liver enlargement, fibrosis, and splenomegaly, indicating that MDA may not be effectively reducing disease morbidity.",Success
Can D-dimer become a new diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis?,no,"No.

Rationale: According to the study, there was no statistically significant difference in D-dimer levels between the histopathologic study groups (P>.05), indicating that D-dimer levels did not differ significantly between patients with and without acute appendicitis. This suggests that D-dimer is not a reliable diagnostic parameter for acute appendicitis.",Success
Is there a relationship between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal disease?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found a significantly higher prevalence of self-reported rheumatoid arthritis in patients referred for periodontal treatment (3.95%) compared to those not referred (0.66%) and the general population (1%). Additionally, a substantial proportion (62.5%) of patients with rheumatoid arthritis referred for periodontal treatment had advanced forms of periodontal disease, suggesting a potential link between the two conditions.",Success
Does telmisartan prevent hepatic fibrosis in rats with alloxan-induced diabetes?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that telmisartan treatment in diabetic rats resulted in no immunoreactivity to TGF-beta, a key mediator of fibrosis, whereas the diabetic control group showed strong immunoreactivity. This suggests that telmisartan may have a protective effect against hepatic fibrosis in diabetic rats.",Success

Does an additional antirotation U-Blade (RC) lag screw improve treatment of AO/OTA 31 A1-3 fractures with gamma 3 nail?,no,"NO. 

Rationale: According to the study, there was no significant reduction in the cut-out rate in group B (U-Blade RC lag screw) compared to group A (standard lag screw), suggesting that the additional antirotation U-Blade RC lag screw did not improve treatment outcomes in terms of cut-out rate.",Success
May mean platelet volume levels be a predictor in the diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease?,yes,YES.,Success
Are head and neck specific quality of life measures necessary?,yes,"YES.

Rationale: The study found that head and neck-specific measures, such as the Head and Neck Survey (H&NS), were more strongly correlated with specific head and neck domains (e.g., eating/swallowing, speech/communication, and appearance) than with general health measures. This suggests that head and neck-specific measures are necessary to capture the unique aspects of quality of life that are not fully reflected by general health measures.",Success
Could chest wall rigidity be a factor in rapid death from illicit fentanyl abuse?,yes,YES.,Success
Is severe pain immediately after spinal augmentation a predictor of long-term outcomes?,no,NO.,Success
Can computerised tomography replace bone scintigraphy in detecting bone metastases from breast cancer?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that CT detected metastatic bone lesions in 98% of patients with bone metastases, with only one patient having a solitary, asymptomatic bony metastasis in the shaft of femur that was not detected by CT. In contrast, BS was positive in all patients with bone metastases, but had 11 cases of false positive findings. This suggests that CT can be a reliable alternative to BS for detecting bone metastases from breast cancer.",Success
Does obesity impact the pattern and outcome of trauma in children?,no,"YES. According to the study, obese children had a higher injury severity score, lower pediatric trauma score, and were more likely to have rib fractures and pelvic injuries compared to non-obese children. However, there was no significant association between mortality and obesity.",Success
Is (18)F-FDG a surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia?,no,"No.

Rationale: The study compared the uptake of (14)C-EF3 and (18)F-FDG in mouse tumor models under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The results showed a low dice similarity index (DSI) between the two tracers, indicating poor correlation between FDG uptake and tumor hypoxia. The DSI values ranged from 0.20 to 0.36, suggesting that FDG is not a reliable surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia.",Success
Are 99mTc leukocyte scintigraphy and SBFT studies useful in children suspected of having inflammatory bowel disease?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that 99mTc-WBC scintigraphy was positive in almost all children with newly diagnosed Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or miscellaneous colitis, and correctly predicted inflammation in the terminal ileum in children with equivocal UGI-SBFT studies. Although there were some false-negative results, these were seen in children with mild inflammation on biopsies and normal UGI-SBFT studies, suggesting that 99mTc-WBC scintigraphy can be a useful tool in excluding inflammation in children suspected of having IBD.",Success
Prostate bed target interfractional motion using RTOG consensus definitions and daily CT on rails : Does target motion differ between superior and inferior portions of the clinical target volume?,no,NO.,Success
Esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy in portal hypertension: safe and effective?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that esophagogastric devascularization without splenectomy (EDWS) decreased portal venous pressure by 20% postoperatively, had a lower morbidity rate of portal venous system thrombosis, and had a low recurrence rate of esophagogastric variceal hemorrhage (0% at 1 year and 4.5% at 3 years). These results suggest that EDWS is a safe and effective treatment option for portal hypertension.",Success
Does maternal obesity have an influence on feeding behavior of obese children?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found no difference in the scores of the subscales ""perceived responsibility"", ""restriction"", ""concern for child's weight"", and ""monitoring"" between obese and non-obese mothers, suggesting that maternal obesity does not influence feeding behavior in obese children. However, the study did find correlations between child's BMI-SDS and mothers' personal weight perception, concern for child's weight, and restriction, indicating that mothers' attitudes and perceptions may play a role in their children's weight status.",Success
Should lower limb fractures be treated surgically in patients with chronic spinal injuries?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: According to the study, patients who underwent surgical treatment had better clinical results, range of motion, bone consolidation, and fewer pressure ulcers and radiological misalignment compared to those treated orthopaedically. Although there is no current consensus, the study's findings suggest that surgical treatment may be a viable option for patients with chronic spinal cord injuries and lower limb fractures.",Success
Does short-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors cause rebound aggravation of symptoms?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found no significant difference in symptom scores (reflux, total, and antacid scores) during the placebo period between the groups given lansoprazole first and placebo first, indicating that short-term treatment with proton pump inhibitors (in this case, lansoprazole) does not cause rebound aggravation of symptoms.",Success
Do family physicians make good sentinels for influenza?,yes,"YES.

Rationale: The study found that family physicians reported peak morbidity 1 to 4 weeks earlier than state and territorial health departments in four of five seasons, and 2 to 5 weeks earlier than peak mortality reported by 121 cities during seasons with excess mortality associated with pneumonia and influenza. Additionally, physicians obtained influenza virus isolates from a greater proportion of specimens compared with those processed by World Health Organization laboratories, and the isolates peaked 1 to 4 weeks earlier than those reported by World Health Organization laboratories. This suggests that family physicians can provide timely and accurate information about influenza activity, making them good sentinels for influenza.",Success

Scrotal approach to both palpable and impalpable undescended testes: should it become our first choice?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study demonstrates that a single scrotal incision approach can effectively diagnose and treat both palpable and impalpable undescended testicles, with a high success rate (78%) in identifying and managing impalpable testes. The low complication rate and excellent outcomes support the scrotal approach as a viable first-choice option for managing undescended testes.",Success
Does the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia exist?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, the fascial structure in the anterior cervical triangle comprised the strap fascia deep to platysma, but there was no single connective tissue sheet (i.e., the investing layer of the deep cervical fascia) that extended directly between the sternocleidomastoid muscles in the lower cervical region.",Success
Is prophylactic fixation a cost-effective method to prevent a future contralateral fragility hip fracture?,maybe,"Maybe. According to the study, prophylactic fixation is not cost-effective for a 79-year-old woman, but it is a cost-effective method to prevent contralateral hip fracture in women 71-75 years old with a higher relative risk of contralateral fracture and in women younger than 70 years, as long as the additional costs of prophylaxis are less than $6000.",Success
Is double-balloon enteroscopy an accurate method to diagnose small-bowel disorders?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study reported a diagnostic yield of 75% (33/44 cases) for double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) in diagnosing small-bowel disorders, which suggests that DBE is an accurate method for diagnosis. Additionally, the study identified various diagnoses, including bleeding sources, tumors, and inflammatory conditions, which further supports the accuracy of DBE.",Success

Recurrent spontaneous abortion and skewed X-inactivation: is there an association?,no,"NO. 

Rationale: According to the study, the rate of extreme skewing (90% or greater) in the recurrent spontaneous abortion population was 8.6%, which was not statistically different from most of the other groups, indicating no association between skewed X-inactivation and recurrent spontaneous abortion.",Success
Doppler examination of uteroplacental circulation in early pregnancy: can it predict adverse outcome?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found that higher resistance index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) values in the right uterine artery, as well as lower gestational sac-crown-rump length difference, gestational sac/crown-rump length ratio, and yolk sac diameters, were associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. These findings suggest that Doppler examination of uteroplacental circulation in early pregnancy may be a useful predictor of adverse outcome.",Success
Can vitamin C prevent complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures?,yes,"YES. According to the study, vitamin C supplementation significantly reduced the prevalence of complex regional pain syndrome in patients with wrist fractures, with a dose-response effect observed. The relative risk of developing complex regional pain syndrome was lowest in the 500-mg and 1500-mg groups, suggesting that higher doses of vitamin C may be more effective in preventing this condition.",Success
Are income-related differences in active travel associated with physical environmental characteristics?,no,"YES. The study found that the income-related gradient in making active trips remained steep in the least environmentally-deprived areas, suggesting that physical environmental characteristics are associated with income-related differences in active travel.",Success
Can Roux-en-Y gastric bypass provide a lifelong solution for diabetes mellitus?,yes,"Maybe.

Rationale: While Roux-en-Y gastric bypass has been shown to be highly effective in improving or even resolving type 2 diabetes in obese patients, its long-term effects and potential as a lifelong solution are still being studied and debated. The article suggests that gastric bypass may be a promising option for a selected spectrum of diabetes patients, but it does not provide conclusive evidence to support a lifelong solution for all cases of diabetes mellitus. Further research is needed to determine the durability of remission and the potential for gastric bypass to be a lifelong solution.",Success
"Do the changes in the serum levels of IL-2, IL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-6 reflect the inflammatory activity in the patients with post-ERCP pancreatitis?",yes,YES.,Success
Is routine intraoperative frozen-section examination of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer worthwhile?,maybe,"Maybe.

Rationale: The study found that the sensitivity of frozen section (FS) examination of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) varied depending on tumor size and volume of metastatic disease. While FS was effective in detecting macrometastatic disease (sensitivity 92%), it was less effective in detecting micrometastases (sensitivity 17%). The benefit of FS in avoiding reoperative axillary dissection ranged from 4% for T1a to 38% for T2 cancers. These results suggest that routine FS may be worthwhile for certain patient subgroups, such as those with larger tumors, but may not be beneficial for all patients.",Success
Can we predict urinary stone composition based on an analysis of microelement concentration in the hair and urine?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, only a few correlations were found between the composition of stones and the distribution of elements in urine and hair, and all were considered incidental. This suggests that there is no significant or reliable correlation between the microelement concentration in hair and urine and the composition of urinary stones, making it impossible to predict urinary stone composition based on such analysis.",Success
Does intra-abdominal desmoid disease affect patients with an ileal pouch differently than those with an ileorectal anastomosis?,no,NO.,Success
Does anastomotic leakage affect functional outcome after rectal resection for cancer?,no,No.,Success
Health care for immigrants in Europe: is there still consensus among country experts about principles of good practice?,maybe,"YES. Despite some discordance within and between countries, the study found a broad European consensus on most factors characterizing good practice in health care for immigrants, with 9 themes emerging from the aggregated factors.",Success
Is there awareness of pharmaceutical expenditure in the reformed primary care system?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found significant differences between the actual pharmaceutical expenditure (PE) and the doctors' estimates, indicating a lack of awareness among primary care doctors about the true extent of PE. The differences were substantial, with an average discrepancy of around twelve million pesetas. This suggests that the doctors in the reformed primary care system did not have an accurate understanding of PE, indicating a lack of awareness.",Success
Do women with ovaries of polycystic morphology without any other features of PCOS benefit from short-term metformin co-treatment during IVF?,no,"NO. According to the study, metformin co-treatment did not improve live birth rates, clinical pregnancy rates, or reduce severe OHSS rates in women with PCO without other features of PCOS undergoing IVF.",Success
Are women who are treated for hypothyroidism at risk for pregnancy complications?,no,"NO. According to the study, treated hypothyroidism was not associated with any increase in maternal, fetal, or neonatal complications.",Success
"Laparoscopic myomectomy: do size, number, and location of the myomas form limiting factors for laparoscopic myomectomy?",no,No.,Success
Does sex affect the outcome of laparoscopic cholecystectomy?,yes,"YES. According to the study, male sex is associated with a higher conversion rate to open cholecystectomy, longer operative time, and a higher incidence of bile duct injuries, gallbladder perforation, and gallstone spillage compared to female patients. Multivariate regression analysis also showed that male sex is an independent risk factor for conversion to open cholecystectomy and biliary injuries.",Success
Is atropine needed with ketamine sedation?,yes,"NO. 

Rationale: Although atropine reduced hypersalivation and vomiting, it increased the incidence of transient rash. The study did not demonstrate a significant improvement in procedural success rate, parental/patient satisfaction, or tolerance scores with the addition of atropine to ketamine sedation. Therefore, based on this study, atropine may not be necessary as an adjunct to ketamine sedation in children undergoing minor painful procedures.",Success
Do family physicians know the costs of medical care?,no,"NO. According to the study, few respondents (less than 47.2%) estimated costs within 25% of the true cost, and estimates were highly variable, indicating a lack of awareness of the costs of medical care among family physicians.",Success
Can APC mutation analysis contribute to therapeutic decisions in familial adenomatous polyposis?,maybe,"NO.

Rationale: Although the study found correlations between the site of APC mutation and age of disease onset, as well as incidence of desmoids, there was large phenotypic variation within each group of patients, even among those with identical germline mutations. This suggests that APC mutation analysis is not reliable enough to inform therapeutic decisions in individual patients with FAP.",Success
Do emergency medical services professionals think they should participate in disease prevention?,maybe,"YES. According to the study, 82.7% of EMS professionals surveyed believed that they should participate in disease prevention.",Success
Does exercise during pregnancy prevent postnatal depression?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found no significant difference in the incidence of postnatal depression between the intervention group (exercise during pregnancy) and the control group, as measured by EPDS scores ≥10 (p=0.46) and ≥13 (p=0.25). However, a subgroup analysis of women who did not exercise prior to pregnancy showed that exercise during pregnancy may have a preventive effect on postnatal depression (p=0.03).",Success
Is human cytomegalovirus infection associated with hypertension?,no,"Maybe. 

Rationale: The study found an association between HCMV seropositivity and hypertension in women, but not in men. However, the association was attenuated and eventually lost significance after adjusting for various confounding factors, including age. This suggests that the relationship between HCMV infection and hypertension may be complex and influenced by other factors.",Success
Is it possible to stop treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogs in patients with e-antigen negative chronic hepatitis B?,maybe,"Maybe.

Rationale: While the study suggests that discontinuing NA therapy may be feasible in selected patients, the high virological relapse rate of 54.54% in this study indicates that stopping treatment is not a guarantee of sustained response. However, the study also shows that some patients can achieve a sustained response after discontinuation, suggesting that it may be possible to stop treatment in certain individuals. Further studies are needed to identify the specific factors that predict a sustained response and to develop clear guidelines for discontinuing NA therapy in patients with e-antigen negative chronic hepatitis B.",Success
Is laparoscopic cholecystectomy safe and acceptable as a day case procedure?,yes,YES.,Success
Rectal cancer threatening or affecting the prostatic plane: is partial prostatectomy oncologically adequate?,maybe,"YES.

Rationale: According to the study, partial prostatectomy after preoperative chemoradiotherapy resulted in a free anterior CRM (circumferential resection margin) in all cases, indicating that partial prostatectomy is oncologically adequate in terms of achieving a negative CRM.",Success
Does a family meetings intervention prevent depression and anxiety in family caregivers of dementia patients?,no,NO.,Success
Does preoperative anemia adversely affect colon and rectal surgery outcomes?,yes,YES.,Success
Is serum total bilirubin useful to differentiate cardioembolic stroke from other stroke subtypes?,yes,YES.,Success
Delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis: is it worth the additional cost of radiation and time?,no,NO.,Success
"Suturing of the nasal septum after septoplasty, is it an effective alternative to nasal packing?",yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study results show that suturing the nasal septum after septoplasty had comparable or better outcomes compared to nasal packing in terms of bleeding, septal hematoma, septal perforation, and postoperative adhesions. Although the operating time was 4 minutes longer in the suturing group, the benefits of reduced complications outweigh this minor increase in operating time, making suturing a viable alternative to nasal packing.",Success
Does ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament affect the neurological outcome after traumatic cervical cord injury?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, there was no significant difference in ASIA motor scores between the OPLL+ and OPLL- groups at admission and discharge, and no significant correlation was found between canal diameters and neurologic outcome. Additionally, the mean improvement rate in ASIA motor score was actually higher in the OPLL+ group (55.5%) compared to the OPLL- group (43.1%). These findings suggest that OPLL does not have a significant impact on neurologic outcomes in patients with acute cervical spinal cord injury.",Success
Canada's Compassionate Care Benefit: is it an adequate public health response to addressing the issue of caregiver burden in end-of-life care?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, informal caregivers identified several determinants of health outlined in the PHP model that are implicated in their burden experience, and they recognized the need for improving the CCB to better address these determinants. This suggests that the current CCB is not adequately addressing the caregiver burden, as perceived by the caregivers themselves.",Success
Fatigue in primary Sjögren's syndrome: is there a link with the fibromyalgia syndrome?,no,"Yes, there is a link between fatigue in primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) and fibromyalgia syndrome (FM).",Success
Is laparoscopic sonography a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging colorectal cancer?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: According to the study, laparoscopic ultrasonography (LUS) demonstrated a high sensitivity in evaluating hepatic metastases (100%) and nodal metastases (94%), outperforming preoperative staging and laparoscopy in these aspects. Although LUS had a low specificity for nodal metastases (53%), its overall diagnostic accuracy and impact on therapeutic decision-making (changing the therapeutic program in 33% of cases, including 12% due to LUS alone) suggest that it is a reliable and sensitive procedure for staging colorectal cancer.",Success
Alcohol consumption and acute myocardial infarction: a benefit of alcohol consumed with meals?,yes,Yes.,Success
Can Ambu self-inflating bag and Neopuff infant resuscitator provide adequate and safe manual inflations for infants up to 10 kg weight?,maybe,"No.

Rationale: According to the study, the Ambu self-inflating bag (SIB) accurately delivered targeted pressures in all three lung models, whereas the Neopuff T-piece resuscitator was unable to reach set peak inflation pressures and exhibited elevated positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) with all inflow gas rates. This suggests that the Ambu SIB can provide adequate and safe manual inflations, but the Neopuff may not be able to do so, especially in terms of pressure delivery and PEEP control.",Success
Are IgM-enriched immunoglobulins an effective adjuvant in septic VLBW infants?,yes,"YES. 

Rationale: The study found a significant reduction in short-term mortality (22% vs 46%, p = 0.005) in VLBW infants treated with IgM-enriched immunoglobulins (IgM-eIVIG) in addition to standard antibiotic regimen, compared to those receiving antimicrobial regimen alone. This suggests that IgM-enriched immunoglobulins are an effective adjuvant in reducing short-term mortality in septic VLBW infants.",Success
Is resected stomach volume related to weight loss after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy?,no,"No. According to the study, there were no significant differences in mean %EBWL among the three groups with different resected stomach volumes, suggesting that resected stomach volume is not related to weight loss after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.",Success
Resection of colorectal liver metastases after second-line chemotherapy: is it worthwhile?,no,"YES. 

Rationale: Although disease-free survival was shorter in patients who received second-line chemotherapy before resection of colorectal liver metastases, overall survival was similar between patients who received one or two lines of preoperative chemotherapy. This suggests that resection of colorectal liver metastases after second-line chemotherapy can still be a worthwhile treatment option.",Success
Do ART patients face higher C-section rates during their stage of delivery?,yes,"YES. According to the study, ART patients, specifically those who underwent fresh embryo transfer and slow freezing, have higher risks for both elective and emergency C-sections compared to spontaneous conception.",Success
Neck pain treatment with acupuncture: does the number of needles matter?,no,No.,Success
Does fluoridation reduce the use of dental services among adults?,maybe,"Maybe.

Rationale: The study found that adults with high fluoridation exposure had a lower probability of receiving a restoration than adults with no exposure, but only when considering teeth with decay and unsatisfactory fillings at baseline. However, the study also found that more than half of the restorations were performed to replace fillings of satisfactory or ideal quality at baseline, which suggests that fluoridation may not reduce the overall use of dental services. Additionally, the study detected market effects, such as supplier-induced demand, which could influence the use of dental services. Therefore, the relationship between fluoridation and the use of dental services is complex and cannot be definitively stated as a simple ""yes"" or ""no"".",Success
Pertrochanteric fractures: is there an advantage to an intramedullary nail?,no,No.,Success
Are the GFRUP's recommendations for withholding or withdrawing treatments in critically ill children applicable?,yes,YES.,Success
Is inhaled prophylactic heparin useful for prevention and Management of Pneumonia in ventilated ICU patients?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found no significant differences between the treatment groups (inhaled sodium heparin, inhaled sodium chloride, and usual care) in terms of the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) using either Klompas criteria or clinical diagnosis. Additionally, there were no differences in clinical consistency, number, or total volume of secretions per day. The only significant difference found was a lower presence of blood in secretions in the usual care group, which does not support the use of inhaled prophylactic heparin for the prevention and management of pneumonia in ventilated ICU patients.",Success
Is the h-index predictive of greater NIH funding success among academic radiologists?,yes,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, having an h-index >10 was associated with increased likelihood of receiving NIH funding, but it was not predictive of greater funding success in terms of the number of grant awards, years of prior funding, amounts of grant awards, or grant classification.",Success
"Does obesity predict knee pain over fourteen years in women, independently of radiographic changes?",yes,YES.,Success
Do liquid-based preparations of urinary cytology perform differently than classically prepared cases?,yes,YES.,Success
Does a well developed collateral circulation predispose to restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found that restenosis rates were similar in patients with poor and good collateral circulation, and the collateral flow index (CFI) was not correlated with diameter, area, or volumetric restenosis. Additionally, multivariate analysis identified other factors such as stent diameter, stent length, residual stenosis, and smoking history as predictive of restenosis, but not collateral circulation.",Success
Does route of delivery affect maternal and perinatal outcome in women with eclampsia?,no,"NO. 

Rationale: According to the study, the maternal event rate was similar between the cesarean and vaginal delivery groups, and the difference in neonatal event rates was not statistically significant. This suggests that the route of delivery (cesarean or vaginal) does not have a significant impact on maternal and perinatal outcomes in women with eclampsia.",Success
Has the prevalence of health care services use increased over the last decade (2001-2009) in elderly people?,yes,"YES. According to the study, the number of general practitioner visits among both women and men significantly increased from 2001 to 2009, indicating an increase in the prevalence of health care services use over the last decade.",Success
Does high-dose radiotherapy benefit palliative lung cancer patients?,no,"NO. 

Rationale: The study found no significant difference in median survival times between patients treated with 25 Gy in 5 fractions (low-dose) and 50 Gy in 20 fractions (high-dose) in the overall population (p = 0.334) or in the subgroups of patients with good-fair (p = 0.694) or poor overall condition (p = 0.248). This suggests that high-dose radiotherapy does not provide a survival benefit for palliative lung cancer patients.",Success
Is endothelin-1 an aggravating factor in the development of acute pancreatitis?,yes,"YES.

Rationale: The study suggests that blocking ETA receptors with BQ123 reduces the severity of acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis in rats, implying that endothelin-1, which binds to ETA receptors, is an aggravating factor in the development of acute pancreatitis.",Success
"Malnutrition, a new inducer for arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients?",yes,"YES.

Rationale: The study found a significant association between malnutrition and arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients. The MQSGA score, which evaluates nutrition status, showed a positive relationship with calcification score and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP, which are markers of arterial calcification. Additionally, the levels of serum albumin, a marker of nutrition status, were negatively associated with calcification score and the expressions of BMP2 and MGP. These findings suggest that malnutrition may play a role in inducing arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients.",Success
Does glomerular hyperfiltration in pregnancy damage the kidney in women with more parities?,no,"NO.

Rationale: The study found that women with four or more parities (group 3) had significantly higher GFR values compared to women with fewer parities (groups 1 and 2), indicating glomerular hyperfiltration. However, there was no evidence of kidney damage, as serum urea and serum creatinine levels were similar between the three groups. This suggests that glomerular hyperfiltration in pregnancy may be a physiological adaptation in women with more parities, rather than a damaging process.",Success
Can the Internet be used to improve sexual health awareness in web-wise young people?,maybe,"YES. 

The study suggests that the majority of the young people (78.0%) had access to the Internet elsewhere, and 62.0% used it at least once a week, indicating a high level of familiarity and comfort with the Internet. Moreover, 62.4% of participants expressed interest in using a GUM website, and 70.4% were interested in a 'question line' where they could e-mail questions to a healthcare professional. This indicates that the Internet could be a viable platform for providing sex education and information to this demographic.",Success
Is eligibility for a chemotherapy protocol a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer after radical cystectomy?,yes,"YES.

Rationale: The study found that patients who were eligible for the adjuvant chemotherapy protocol (protocol group) had better outcomes compared to the matched group and the remaining group, including longer median overall survival, longer recurrence-free survival, lower rates of tumor progression, and lower rates of cancer-related death. These findings suggest that eligibility for the chemotherapy protocol is a good prognostic factor for invasive bladder cancer after radical cystectomy.",Success
Can ki-67 play a role in prediction of breast cancer patients' response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy?,yes,"Maybe.

Rationale: Although the study found that Ki-67 values did not differ significantly among the 3 groups (pCR, partial pathological response, and stable disease/progress), it did find that Ki-67 values differed significantly among different breast cancer subtypes (luminal, Her2 enriched, and basal-like cancers). Additionally, within the luminal tumor group, Ki-67 values differed significantly between patients with and without pCR. This suggests that Ki-67 may have some predictive value, but it is not a straightforward correlation. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of Ki-67 in predicting breast cancer patients' response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",Success
Intravenous administration of metoclopramide by 2 min bolus vs 15 min infusion: does it affect the improvement of headache while reducing the side effects?,yes,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, there were no significant differences between the BIG (bolus infusion) and SIG (slow infusion) groups in terms of mean headache scores (p = 0.34), indicating that both methods of administration were equally effective in relieving headache symptoms. However, the study found a significant difference in the incidence of akathisia, a side effect, with 29.3% of patients in the BIG group experiencing akathisia compared to 6.5% in the SIG group (p = 0.001). This suggests that the slow infusion over 15 minutes may reduce the side effects of metoclopramide, specifically akathisia, while maintaining its therapeutic effect on headache relief.",Success
Can patient coaching reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control?,yes,"YES. The study found that patient coaching significantly reduced racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain control, as evidenced by the elimination of disparities in pain levels between minority and white patients in the experimental group.",Success
Are tuberculosis patients adherent to prescribed treatments in China?,maybe,"No. According to the study, 36.0% of patients experienced non-adherence, and 28.2% were lost to follow-up, indicating that a significant proportion of TB patients in China do not adhere to their prescribed treatments.",Success
Is there any interest to perform ultrasonography in boys with undescended testis?,no,"NO.

Rationale: According to the study, ultrasonography did not detect retractile testes, detected only 67% of palpable undescended testes, and missed abdominal testes in cases of non-palpable testes. Additionally, ultrasonography sometimes falsely interpreted other structures as a testis. These findings suggest that ultrasonography is not a reliable diagnostic tool for evaluating boys with undescended testis, making it of little interest to perform ultrasonography in these cases.",Success
Is peak concentration needed in therapeutic drug monitoring of vancomycin?,no,"NO. 

Rationale: According to the study, the analysis of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships revealed that trough concentration (Cmin) and area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC0-24) were significant predictors of efficacy and nephrotoxicity, respectively. Peak concentration was not identified as a necessary parameter for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of vancomycin.",Success
Can autologous platelet-rich plasma gel enhance healing after surgical extraction of mandibular third molars?,yes,"Maybe. 

Rationale: The study found that the PRP group had lower postoperative pain scores, which were statistically significant. However, the differences in swelling, interincisal mouth opening, and radiographic scores for lamina dura, trabecular pattern, and bone density were not statistically significant. While the study suggests a potential benefit of PRP gel in reducing postoperative pain, the evidence for enhanced healing is not conclusive. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of PRP gel on healing after surgical extraction of mandibular third molars.",Success
Are sugars-free medicines more erosive than sugars-containing medicines?,no,"NO. According to the study, there was no significant difference in endogenous pH and titratable acidity between sugars-containing (SC) and sugars-free (SF) formulations (P>0.05).",Success
