Clinical identifiers for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis: are we seeing the real picture?,no,"Based on the study, the answer is: Maybe.

The study aimed to validate clinical identifiers for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis, but the results were inconclusive. While some identifiers (global loss of passive range of movement, pain at the end of range of all measured active movements, and global loss of passive glenohumeral movements) were associated with a positive anesthetic response (PAR), only pain at the end of range of all measured active movements remained significant after stepwise removal of variables. However, this identifier was associated with reduced odds of a PAR, which is counterintuitive.

Is (18)F-FDG a surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia?,no,"Maybe.

The study's results suggest that (18)F-FDG is not an ideal surrogate tracer to measure tumor hypoxia. Under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, the similarity between (14)C-EF3 and FDG activity distributions decreased with higher activity sub-volumes. The Dice Similarity Index (DSI) values were relatively low, indicating a limited correlation between the two tracers. This contradicts the initial hypothesis that FDG uptake increases under hypoxic conditions due to enhanced glycolysis. However, the study's findings do not entirely rule out the possibility that FDG may still be useful in certain contexts or with specific tumor types. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between FDG uptake and tumor hypoxia.",Success
