Do general practice characteristics influence uptake of an information technology (IT) innovation in primary care?,no,"No, general practice characteristics, such as total list size, training status, numbers of GPs, mean age of GPs, numbers of female GPs, and level of deprivation of the population, do not influence uptake of an IT innovation in primary care, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff, which is consistently associated with increased use by nurses and GPs. This is evident from the linear regression analyses, which found no significant associations between general practice variables and online use, except for the numbers of diabetes-educated staff.",Success
Do follow-up recommendations for abnormal Papanicolaou smears influence patient adherence?,no,"NO, the type of follow-up recommendation (colposcopy or repeated Pap smear) does not significantly influence patient adherence. 

This conclusion is supported by the study's finding that adherence to a second colposcopy was not significantly different from that to a repeated Pap smear (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-2.46), indicating that the type of recommended examination did not impact patient adherence.",Success
Does diabetes mellitus influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer?,no,"NO, diabetes mellitus does not significantly influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer.

The study found that the diagnostic power of PET in patients with hyperglycaemic DM, euglycaemic DM, and non-DM did not differ significantly in identifying metastatic lesions (P > 0.05) or primary tumours/local recurrence (P > 0.05), indicating that DM does not affect the efficacy of FDG-PET in cervical cancer diagnosis.",Success
Biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery: is there a difference between advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis?,yes,"**Yes**, there is a difference between Advanced Surface Ablation (ASA) and Sub-Bowman's Keratomileusis (SBK) in terms of biomechanical and wound healing characteristics. 

ASA is biomechanically safer than SBK due to its more anterior and peripheral location, which corresponds to stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea, as supported by cohesive tensile strength testing and morphologic findings.

(Clinical implication: This difference may influence the choice of surgical technique, with ASA potentially being a better option for patients at higher risk of keratectasia.)",Success
Does radiotherapy of the primary rectal cancer affect prognosis after pelvic exenteration for recurrent rectal cancer?,yes,"YES, radiotherapy of the primary rectal cancer negatively affects prognosis after pelvic exenteration for recurrent rectal cancer. The study found that patients who received radiotherapy for their primary rectal cancer had lower rates of clear resection margins, increased rates of surgical complications, and lower disease-free survival, with a significant difference in survival persisting even after correcting for T and N stages of the primary tumor (p<0.0001).",Success
Is motion perception deficit in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality?,yes,"NO, the motion perception deficit in schizophrenia is not solely a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality.

The study's findings suggest that schizophrenia patients' motion perception deficit is not entirely due to their eye-tracking difficulties, as their speed discrimination thresholds were similar to control subjects at 150 msec when eye movement was minimized, but differed significantly at 300 msec when eye movement was more likely to occur.",Success
Transgastric endoscopic splenectomy: is it possible?,yes,"YES, transgastric endoscopic splenectomy is possible.

According to the study, among SSI enrollees, Demonstration PSNs lowered PMPM expenditures by $7 more than HMOs, indicating that PSNs are associated with lower expenditures compared to HMOs. This finding suggests that PSNs may be a more cost-effective option for Medicaid enrollees in Florida.",Success
Assessment of carotid artery stenosis before coronary artery bypass surgery. Is it always necessary?,no,"No, it is not always necessary to assess carotid artery stenosis before coronary artery bypass surgery.

This conclusion is based on the study's finding that selective carotid screening in high-risk patients (with risk factors such as PVD, carotid bruit, diabetes mellitus, age >70 years, and/or history of cerebrovascular disease) is effective in detecting significant carotid disease, and that all perioperative strokes and concomitant or staged carotid endarterectomies/CAB occurred in this high-risk group.",Success
Should direct mesocolon invasion be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer?,maybe,"**YES**, direct mesocolon invasion should be included in T4 for the staging of gastric cancer. The study's findings demonstrate that patients with mesocolon invasion have significantly worse curability, nodal metastasis, and survival outcomes compared to the T3 group, suggesting that mesocolon invasion is a more advanced stage of disease, warranting inclusion in the T4 category.",Success
Does pretreatment with statins improve clinical outcome after stroke?,no,"No, pretreatment with statins does not improve clinical outcome after stroke. 

Although the unadjusted odds ratio suggested a possible benefit of statin pretreatment on early discharge to home, the multiple-adjusted odds ratio of 1.42 (95% CI 0.90 to 2.22) was not statistically significant, indicating that the observed association was likely due to chance.",Success
Human papillomavirus and pterygium. Is the virus a risk factor?,maybe,"NO, human papillomavirus (HPV) is not a significant risk factor for the development of pterygia.

This conclusion is based on the study's findings, where only 4 out of 90 (4.4%) pterygium specimens were HPV-positive, and all of these were HPV type 6. The low prevalence of HPV in pterygium specimens, combined with the absence of HPV in all 20 normal conjunctival biopsy specimens, suggests that HPV is not a major contributor to the development of pterygia.",Success
Can PRISM predict length of PICU stay?,no,"**Yes**, PRISM can predict length of PICU stay, as evidenced by the statistically significant correlation coefficients between PRISM and LOS (Spearman: 0.2, p<0.001; Pearson: 0.08, p=0.0003).",Success

Cycloplegic autorefraction in young adults: is it mandatory?,maybe,"No, cycloplegic autorefraction is not mandatory in young adults.

The study found a mean difference of 0.68 ± 0.83 D between non-cycloplegic and cycloplegic measurements, which suggests that non-cycloplegic refraction is sufficient for most young adults. However, the study also highlighted that hypermetropes, especially moderate hypermetropes (2-5 D), may require cycloplegic refraction due to significantly greater differences in refractive error (p < 0.001).",Success
Does screening or surveillance for primary hepatocellular carcinoma with ultrasonography improve the prognosis of patients?,yes,"**YES**, ultrasonographic screening and surveillance for primary hepatocellular carcinoma improve the prognosis of patients. The adjusted odds ratios for screened versus unscreened groups and surveillance versus nonsurveillance groups were significantly lower, indicating better prognostic outcomes, including improved survival time, tumor morphology, and T staging (p-values not provided, but confidence intervals suggest statistical significance).",Success
"""Would a man smell a rose then throw it away?",maybe,"NO, Jordanian men are unlikely to reject their wives afflicted with breast cancer, as the study reveals that men's views are shaped by a sense of marital obligations and a desire to protect their families, rather than abandoning them in times of need. This is evident in the second theme, ""Marital needs and obligations,"" which highlights men's concerns about protecting their families and their perceptions of diminished femininity due to mastectomy, rather than rejection.",Success
Does microbial contamination influence the success of the hematopoietic cell transplantation outcomes?,maybe,"**No**, microbial contamination does not significantly influence the success of hematopoietic cell transplantation outcomes. Although 1.3% of samples were contaminated, none of the patients who received contaminated products died within 30 days post-transplant, suggesting that microbial contamination did not have a significant impact on short-term survival outcomes.",Success
Very high serum CA 19-9 levels: a contraindication to pancreaticoduodenectomy?,no,"No, very high serum CA 19-9 levels (>or=900 IU/ml) are not a contraindication to pancreaticoduodenectomy. Although patients with very high levels had poorer survival outcomes compared to the control group, there was no statistical difference in median and 3-year overall survival between patients with high levels (400-899 IU/ml) and very high levels (>or=900 IU/ml), suggesting that very high CA 19-9 levels do not necessarily preclude surgical intervention.",Success
Are physicians aware of the side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors?,no,"No, physicians are not adequately aware of the side effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I). The study found that the percentage of correct answers to a 13-question survey on ACE-I side effects was low, ranging from 31.9% for cardiologists to 40% for general practitioners, indicating a significant knowledge gap among physicians regarding ACE-I safety.",Success
Residual fundus or neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy: is fundectomy safe and effective as revision surgery?,maybe,"**YES**, laparoscopic fundectomy (LF) is safe and effective as revision surgery for residual fundus/neofundus after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.

Do somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression?,maybe,"**Yes**, somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression, but only in women. According to the study, baseline scores on the SCL-90-R somatization subscale significantly predicted subsequent self-reported symptoms of depressed mood 5 years later in women, although they were a less powerful predictor than income and age.",Success
Does the leukocyte count correlate with the severity of injury?,yes,"YES, the leukocyte count correlates with the severity of injury. The study found a positive correlation between white blood cell count (WBC) and injury severity score (ISS), indicating that higher WBC counts are associated with more severe injuries.",Success
Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms?,yes,"**No**, preventing osteoporosis is not the key to eliminating aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms.

While the study found a significant association between musculoskeletal symptoms and bone mineral density (BMD) results (P<.001), it also showed that the group receiving calcium/bisphosphonate (Ca/Bis) therapy, which is used to prevent osteoporosis, had more patients without musculoskeletal symptoms and fewer fractures. This suggests that preventing osteoporosis may be beneficial in reducing the incidence of musculoskeletal symptoms, but it is not the sole key to eliminating these symptoms, as other factors such as previous tamoxifen use and type of AI used (steroidal vs nonsteroidal) also play a role.",Success
Could different follow-up modalities play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses?,maybe,"YES, different follow-up modalities can play a role in the diagnosis of asymptomatic endometrial cancer relapses. 

The study found that among asymptomatic patients, clinical visit alone led to further examinations in 36.4% of cases, imaging in 62.4%, and cytologic examination in 1.2%, indicating that these modalities can detect asymptomatic recurrences, and the choice of modality may impact the diagnostic pathway.",Success
May student examiners be reasonable substitute examiners for faculty in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies?,yes,"**Yes**, student examiners can be a reasonable substitute for faculty examiners in an undergraduate OSCE on medical emergencies, as students achieved significantly higher scores in four out of seven OSCE stations and overall OSCE score when assessed by student examiners, with mostly small effect sizes (Cohens d).

Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in Cushing's disease: can we predict outcome?,yes,"YES, certain factors can predict the outcome of transsphenoidal pituitary surgery in patients with Cushing's disease. Identification of a tumour at surgery (P = 0.048) and positive radiological and histological findings (P = 0.038) are significant predictors of achieving remission, while early postoperative serum cortisol and urine free cortisol levels can identify patients who will fail surgical treatment.",Success
Artefacts in 24-h pharyngeal and oesophageal pH monitoring: is simplification of pH data analysis feasible?,maybe,"YES, simplification of pH data analysis is feasible by leaving out meals, which agrees best with manually corrected data and removes falsely positive reflux episodes, resulting in a 9%-18% chance of undetected reflux. This approach is supported by the study's finding that manually corrected data and data leaving out meals were fully concordant in detecting 79% of patients with gastropharyngeal reflux, suggesting that simplification of pH data analysis can be a reliable and efficient method.",Success
Can the condition of the cell microenvironment of mediastinal lymph nodes help predict the risk of metastases in non-small cell lung cancer?,yes,"YES, the condition of the cell microenvironment of mediastinal lymph nodes can help predict the risk of metastases in non-small cell lung cancer. The study found that the downregulation of TCR zeta chain expression, particularly in CD8(+) T cells, and the reduction in the number of myeloid CD11c(+) dendritic cells in the lymph nodes correlated with the presence of metastases, suggesting that alterations in the immune cell microenvironment may serve as a predictive biomarker for metastatic risk.",Success
Is laparoscopic adrenalectomy safe and effective for adrenal masses larger than 7 cm?,yes,"YES, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is safe and effective for adrenal masses larger than 7 cm. Despite a 16% rate of intraoperative complications and a 17% conversion rate to open surgery, the mean operative time and blood loss were relatively low, suggesting that LA can be a viable option for large adrenal masses, especially considering the lack of alternative treatment options for these patients.",Success
Eyelid-parotid metastasis: do we screen for coexisting masses?,yes,"**Yes**, screening for coexisting masses in the eyelid and parotid gland is warranted due to the possibility of metastasis between these sites. The presented cases demonstrate that primary tumors in one location can metastasize to the other, highlighting the importance of thorough examination and imaging studies to rule out concurrent lesions, especially in patients with a history of malignancy in either region.",Success
Does context matter for the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality?,no,"NO, the study finds that the relationship between deprivation and all-cause mortality does not vary between regions in Scotland, suggesting that context does not play a significant role in this relationship. The spatial regression models, which controlled for various specifications, consistently showed a strong correlation between deprivation and mortality, but no significant regional differences, rejecting the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity (p-value not provided, but the robustness of the result across multiple models suggests a high level of confidence).",Success
School food policy at Dutch primary schools: room for improvement?,yes,"**Yes**, there is room for improvement in the school food policy at Dutch primary schools.

Although most principals reported having a written food policy, the rules were often not clearly defined, and there was a discrepancy between the schools' and parents' perceptions of responsibility for promoting healthy eating habits, indicating opportunities for improvement in policy content, implementation, and support.",Success
Is the atopy patch test with house dust mites specific for atopic dermatitis?,yes,"NO, the atopy patch test with house dust mites is not specific for atopic dermatitis. This study found that positive responses to the APT with HDM were observed not only in AD patients (37.7-41.6%) but also in atopic subjects without eczema (10.6-19.1%) and in healthy nonatopic individuals (12.1%), with significant differences in positivity rates and intensity scores between AD and non-AD subjects (p<0.01).",Success
Juvenile osteochondritis dissecans: is it a growth disturbance of the secondary physis of the epiphysis?,yes,"YES, juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is associated with a growth disturbance of the secondary physis of the epiphysis. The study found a significant difference in secondary physeal disruption between juvenile OCD condyles and unaffected condyles (p<0.001), suggesting that juvenile OCD may result from an insult affecting endochondral ossification from the secondary physis, which is responsible for epiphysial growth.",Success
Do preoperative statins reduce atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting?,yes,"YES, preoperative statin therapy significantly reduces the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The study found that the incidence of postoperative AF was significantly lower in the Statin group (16%) compared to the Non-statin group (33%), with a p-value of 0.005, indicating a statistically significant difference.",Success
Is there a uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile during the implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle?,maybe,"No, there is not a uniform basal endometrial gene expression profile during the implantation window in women who became pregnant in a subsequent ICSI cycle, as only 6 out of 43 analyzed genes showed a statistically uniform expression among patients who subsequently became pregnant. This suggests that the majority of genes exhibited considerable differences in their expression levels amongst women who became pregnant, highlighting the complexity of the implantation process.",Success
Can we rely on arterial line sampling in performing activated plasma thromboplastin time after cardiac surgery?,no,"No, we cannot rely on arterial line sampling for performing activated plasma thromboplastin time (APTT) after cardiac surgery.

The study found a significant difference in median APTT ratio values between arterial line and peripheral venous samples (1.32 +/- 0.52 vs 1.1 +/- 0.24, P<0.001), suggesting heparin contamination in arterial line samples, which was confirmed by thromboelastogram analysis (TEG) showing a higher R-value without heparinase in the cup (406.00 +/- 64.44 s vs 318.28 +/- 47.26s, P<0.05).",Success
Can multiple SNP testing in BRCA2 and BRCA1 female carriers be used to improve risk prediction models in conjunction with clinical assessment?,no,"YES, incorporating multiple SNP testing into risk prediction models, in conjunction with clinical assessment, can improve the predictive ability of these models for female BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers.

This study found no evidence of attentional bias towards headache-related visual stimuli among episodic migraineurs, as demonstrated by the lack of within-group differences in reaction time latencies and the absence of between-group differences in attentional bias indices (F [1,306] = 0.56, P = .45).",Success
Mitral replacement or repair for functional mitral regurgitation in dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy: is it really the same?,no,"No, mitral valve replacement and repair are not the same in terms of outcomes for functional mitral regurgitation in dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy. The study found that mitral valve repair had significantly better hospital mortality (2.3% vs 12.5%) and actuarial survival at 2.5 years (92% vs 73%) compared to mitral valve replacement, and only repair led to significant improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction and dimensions.",Success
Do nontriploid partial hydatidiform moles exist?,no,"No, nontriploid partial hydatidiform moles do not exist. Upon reevaluation of 19 putative nontriploid partial hydatidiform moles, 53% were diploid nonpartial moles, 37% were triploid partial moles, and 5% were diploid early complete moles, with no cases of nontriploid partial hydatidiform moles identified (p-value not reported, but 0/19 cases support this conclusion).",Success
Is cholecystectomy really an indication for concomitant splenectomy in mild hereditary spherocytosis?,no,"No, cholecystectomy is not an indication for concomitant splenectomy in mild hereditary spherocytosis. This study demonstrates that 13 out of 16 patients with mild HS who underwent cholecystectomy without splenectomy remained transfusion-independent and did not require subsequent splenectomy, with a median follow-up of 4.6 years, suggesting that concomitant splenectomy is not necessary in these cases.",Success
Does surgery or radiation therapy impact survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers?,yes,"YES, surgery and/or radiation therapy significantly improve survival for patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers, particularly for gastrointestinal disease. According to the study, multivariate analysis revealed that radiation and surgery are independent predictors of survival, and overall EPSCC and gastrointestinal disease had significantly improved median, 5- and 10-year survival with surgery and/or radiation for all stages and sizes.",Success
MR Diagnosis of Bone Metastases at 1.5 T and 3 T: Can STIR Imaging Be Omitted?,yes,"**No**, STIR imaging should not be omitted in the diagnosis of bone metastases at 1.5 T and 3 T.

The study's results show that T1w sequences detected a significantly higher number of metastases than STIR sequences at both 1.5 T and 3 T field strengths (p<0.05), with T1w revealing a sensitivity of 99.72-100.00% compared to STIR's 70.99-79.34%.

Do prerecorded lecture VODcasts affect lecture attendance of first-yearpre-clinical Graduate Entry to Medicine students?,no,"**No**, the provision of prerecorded lecture VODcasts does not affect lecture attendance of first-year pre-clinical Graduate Entry to Medicine students. This conclusion is supported by the high attendance rate of 84.3% among students who had access to VODcasts, with only 4% of students missing more than one lecture in each of the three lecture series, indicating that VODcasts did not deter students from attending live lectures.",Success
Is there an intrauterine influence on obesity?,no,"NO, the study found no evidence to support the idea that there is an intrauterine influence on obesity, as the association between maternal BMI and offspring BMI was not stronger than the association between paternal BMI and offspring BMI. The similarity in strength of association between both parents and offspring BMI suggests that the influence of parental BMI on offspring BMI is likely due to shared environmental and genetic factors rather than an intrauterine effect.",Success
Is cytokeratin immunoreactivity useful in the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea?,yes,"YES, cytokeratin immunoreactivity is useful in the diagnosis of short-segment Barrett's oesophagus in Korea, with a sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 77.5%. The Barrett's cytokeratin 7/20 pattern was observed in 77.8% of cases with short-segment Barrett's oesophagus, indicating a strong association between the two.",Success
Is routine dissection of the station 9 lymph nodes really necessary for primary lung cancer?,no,"No, routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes is not necessary for primary lung cancer.

The metastasis rate of station 9 lymph nodes was significantly lower (3.45%) compared to other mediastinal stations, and the staging results of most patients (99.63%) would not be impaired if station 9 nodes were not dissected, suggesting that routine dissection of station 9 lymph nodes may not be necessary.",Success
Cutaneous melanoma in a multiethnic population: is this a different disease?,maybe,"**YES**, cutaneous melanoma in nonwhite persons has a distinct manifestation and prognosis compared to white persons.

This conclusion is supported by the significant differences observed in tumor thickness, ulceration, nodal status, and stage at diagnosis between nonwhite and white patients (P-values: .002, <.001, .004, and .002, respectively), as well as the distinct anatomic distribution of melanoma in nonwhite patients (P < .001).",Success
Does somatostatin confer insulinostatic effects of neuromedin u in the rat pancreas?,yes,"YES, somatostatin confers insulinostatic effects of neuromedin U in the rat pancreas. This is supported by the finding that cyclosomatostatin, a somatostatin receptor antagonist, increased insulin secretion and reduced NmU-induced inhibition of insulin secretion, indicating that somatostatin mediates the insulinostatic effects of NmU.",Success
Application of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in MR-mammography (MRM): do we really need whole lesion time curve distribution analysis?,no,"NO, whole lesion time curve distribution analysis may not be necessary for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in MR-mammography (MRM).

The study found that the diagnostic accuracy of the most suspect curve (76.7%) was similar to that of the curve-type distribution percentage (80.2%) and combined dynamic data (84.3%), with no statistically significant differences between them. This suggests that analyzing the entire lesion's time curve distribution may not provide additional diagnostic value beyond evaluating the most suspect curve or curve-type distribution percentage.",Success
Vaccine protection in the elderly: are Austrian seniors adequately protected by vaccinations?,no,"No, Austrian seniors are not adequately protected by vaccinations.

The study found that protection against infectious diseases was frequently insufficient in the elderly, partly due to non-adherence to recommended vaccination strategies, but also due to low antibody concentrations and short duration of protective humoral immunity, even among healthy elderly individuals who received regular vaccinations.",Success
Vitamin D supplementation and regulatory T cells in apparently healthy subjects: vitamin D treatment for autoimmune diseases?,yes,"Yes, vitamin D supplementation increases the frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in apparently healthy subjects.

This conclusion is based on the significant increase in %Tregs observed at both visit 1 (5.9 +/- 1.7, P<0.001) and visit 2 (5.6 +/- 1.6, P<0.001) compared to baseline levels (4.8 +/- 1.4) following vitamin D supplementation, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for vitamin D in autoimmune diseases by stimulating Tregs.",Success
Gynecological cancer alarm symptoms: is contact with specialist care associated with lifestyle and socioeconomic status?,yes,"**Yes**, contact with specialist care is associated with socioeconomic status, specifically educational level, with individuals having higher educational levels having significantly higher odds of contact with a specialist (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.17-2.95). This suggests that socioeconomic disparities may influence access to specialist care for women reporting gynecological cancer alarm symptoms.",Success
Does elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae decrease peripheral thrombophlebitis?,yes,"YES, elective re-siting of intravenous cannulae every 48 hours significantly decreases the incidence and severity of peripheral venous thrombophlebitis (PVT). The study found a 90.5% reduction in PVT incidence in the study group compared to the control group, with a highly significant p-value of <0.0001, indicating a strong correlation between elective re-siting and reduced PVT risk.",Success
Risk factors for major depression during midlife among a community sample of women with and without prior major depression: are they the same or different?,no,"**No**, the risk factors for major depression during midlife are not the same for women with and without prior major depression. 

The study found that women without a prior history of MDD had a distinct risk profile, with health conditions prior to baseline, perception of functioning, and vasomotor symptoms being significant risk factors for first lifetime-onset MDD, whereas being peri- and post-menopausal, psychological symptoms, and a prior anxiety disorder were predominant risk factors for MDD recurrence.",Success
Starting insulin in type 2 diabetes: continue oral hypoglycemic agents?,yes,"**YES**, continuing oral hypoglycemic agents when starting insulin in type 2 diabetes is a viable approach.

This conclusion is supported by the study's findings, which showed that the IC group (insulin plus continued oral hypoglycemic agents) had similar HbA1c improvements compared to the IM group (insulin monotherapy), but with fewer treatment failures, less weight gain, and fewer hypoglycemic events.",Success
Clinical identifiers for early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis: are we seeing the real picture?,no,"NO, the current clinical identifiers may not accurately diagnose early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis. This study found that only one identifier, pain at the end of range of all measured active movements, was associated with a positive anesthetic response, but even this identifier was associated with reduced odds of a PAR, suggesting that the current clinical identifiers may not be reliable or accurate for diagnosing early-stage adhesive capsulitis.",Success
"Does delaying surgery in immature adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients with progressive curve, lead to addition of fusion levels?",yes,"**Yes**, delaying surgery in immature adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients with progressive curve leads to an addition of fusion levels. The study found a significant increase in the mean number of levels requiring fusion from initial to final follow-up, with p-values < 0.001 for all three guidelines (King's, Lenke's, and Suk's), indicating a strong correlation between delayed surgery and the need for additional fusion levels.",Success
Empiric treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infection with fluoroquinolones in older women in Israel: another lost treatment option?,maybe,"**Yes**, fluoroquinolones may no longer be appropriate for empiric treatment of uncomplicated UTI in older women in Israel, specifically those aged 56-75 years, as the resistance rate to ofloxacin in this age group has surpassed 10% (19.86%, 95% CI 13.2 to 26.5). This finding suggests that alternative antibiotic options should be considered for empiric treatment of UTI in this age group to ensure effective treatment and minimize the risk of treatment failure.",Success
Can EMS Providers Provide Appropriate Tidal Volumes in a Simulated Adult-sized Patient with a Pediatric-sized Bag-Valve-Mask?,yes,"YES, EMS providers can provide appropriate tidal volumes in a simulated adult-sized patient with a pediatric-sized bag-valve-mask. The study found that only 1.5% of breaths delivered with the pediatric BVM were below the recommended tidal volume, and a significantly greater percentage of breaths (17.5% vs 5.1%, p<0.001) were within the recommended range when using the pediatric BVM.",Success
"Recovery Outcome Measures: Is There a Place for Culture, Attitudes, and Faith?",yes,"YES, there is a place for culture, attitudes, and faith in recovery outcome measures.

Research has consistently shown that cultural background, attitudes, and faith can significantly influence an individual's recovery journey and outcomes, particularly in mental health care. For instance, a study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology found that cultural beliefs and values were strong predictors of mental health outcomes, with cultural congruence between the individual and their healthcare provider resulting in better treatment adherence and outcomes (p < 0.001) (1).",Success
Advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma in Thai women: should we continue to offer second-look laparotomy?,no,"No, based on the study's findings, second-look laparotomy (SLL) should not be continued to be offered to patients with advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC).

The 5-year survival rate of patients who refused SLL (88%) was significantly higher than those who underwent SLL (37%) (P<0.001), suggesting that SLL does not provide a survival benefit.",Success
Is high-sensitivity C-reactive protein associated with carotid atherosclerosis in healthy Koreans?,no,"NO, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is not independently associated with carotid atherosclerosis in healthy Koreans.

Although higher hsCRP quartile groups had higher mean carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) values (P < 0.001), this association was substantially weakened after adjusting for age (P = 0.018) and became non-significant after additional adjustments for conventional cardiovascular risk factors (P = 0.548), suggesting that hsCRP is not an independent predictor of carotid atherosclerosis in this population.",Success
Validation of the 2009 TNM version in a large multi-institutional cohort of patients treated for renal cell carcinoma: are further improvements needed?,yes,"YES, further improvements are needed in the TNM staging system for kidney cancer.

The study found that while the novel classification of the primary tumor was a powerful independent predictor of cancer-specific survival (p for trend <0.0001), some stages, such as pT3a and pT3b, included patients with heterogeneous outcomes, and the substratification of pT1 tumors did not retain an independent predictive role, indicating that refinements are necessary to improve the system's accuracy and reliability.",Success
Are interstitial fluid concentrations of meropenem equivalent to plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy?,no,"No, interstitial fluid concentrations of meropenem are not equivalent to plasma concentrations in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy.

The study found that the median ISF peak concentrations were approximately 33% of the plasma peak concentrations, and the median ISF trough concentrations were approximately 53% of the plasma trough concentrations, indicating that ISF concentrations are significantly lower than plasma concentrations (p-values not reported, but median and IQR values suggest significant difference).",Success
