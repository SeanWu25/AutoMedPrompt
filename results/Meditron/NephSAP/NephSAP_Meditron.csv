Which is the correct statement regarding the rate of correction and amount of patient’s free water deﬁcit?,D,"The correct answer is D. The rate of correction depends on the patient's free water deﬁcit, which can be estimated based on the degree of hypernatremia and total body water (TBW). Assuming 45% TBW in this elderly woman, her free water deﬁcit would be approximately C.5 L. Because sodium levels change by ~1 mmol/L for every 20 ml/kg of free water infused (with minimal ongoing losses), the patient's hypernatremia would only be corrected to a level of approximately 154-156 mmol/L with infusion of 4 liters.

Which ONE of the following would you advise regarding the effect of PGT on her pregnancy outcomes?,A,"Choice B. PGT is associated with an increased risk of fetal anomalies compared with routine assisted reproductive technology
The use of preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) in women with ADPKD who wish to undergo assisted reproduction may be controversial, because the procedure requires an invasive intervention and is associated with a risk for miscarriage. In addition, concerns about the risks for fetal anomalies have been raised. 14 In a review by Homer et al., four of six studies reported a significantly higher rate of fetal anomalies in pregnancies conceived through assisted reproduction compared with spontaneously conceived pregnancies (odds ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval , 1.14 to 1.52). The mechanism of this association is unclear but could be related to the procedure itself or to an increased rate of fetal anomalies in infertile couples. Nevertheless, although these studies raise concern about the potential for adverse effects on fetal outcomes when PGT is used in women with ADPKD, it should be noted that in a retrospective study by Hood et al., no cases of congenital malformations were found among 109 pregnancies in women with ADPKD who underwent assisted reproduction.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,C,"B. Pauci-immune, necrotizing, and crescentic glomerulonephritis
Explanation:
This case has the classic presentation of ANCA associated pauci-immune, necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis (GN). The most important clue is that this patient has signs of a systemic vasculitis. There are a number of types of glomerular disease that have this presentation but only some of them can be ANCA positive.
Proliferative GN with monoclonal Ig deposits is one of the other possibilities as a cause of a rapidly progressive GN (RPGN) and in fact, this type of proliferative GN can often present with similar laboratory findings to ANCA positive RPGN. However, these patients are typically younger and do not have systemic vasculitis. Type I cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis presents similarly to the ANCA positive RPGN but does not usually cause splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy and can often be associated with hepatitis B and C infections.
Type II cryoglobulins are associated with hepatitis C infection, which this patient did not have.

Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management of this patient’s statin therapy?,D,"A: The correct answer is B. Discontinue pravastatin at the time of transplantation
Explanation:
Pravastatin is one of the statins that are metabolized by CYP3A4, and therefore it would likely be affected by the strong immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus. It is recommended to hold pravastatin for 1-2 weeks before transplantation and then restart at half the dose once the immunosuppression regimen has been stabilized.

"In this setting, administration of bicarbonate as speciﬁed will be associated with which ONE of the following outcomes?",C,"The correct answer is (A) Increased risk of mortality. In this setting, administration of bicarbonate as speciﬁed will be associated with increased risk of mortality. 

Studies in critically ill patients have not demonstrated beneﬁt and have shown adverse effects when alkalinizing therapy was used to treat severe metabolic acidemia in the setting of acute kidney injury or shock. The SBE-Lactic Acidosis Trial showed an increased risk of mortality among critically ill patients treated with sodium bicarbonate for lactic acidosis (relative risk, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.0 – 4.8).
In addition to the SBE-Lactic Acidosis Trial, two other prospective trials have demonstrated increased risk of death or new renal replacement therapy among patients who received sodium bicarbonate for severe metabolic acidemia in the setting of acute kidney injury.
Therefore, we recommend against using sodium bicarbonate as an alkalinizing agent to treat lactic acidosis or severe metabolic acidemia in critically ill patients with shock and/or AKI (strength of recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: moderate).
",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management for this patient?,A,"The correct answer is B: The patient's dual antibody positivity puts him at increased risk for a worse outcome, and early treatment with high-dose corticosteroids (1 g/day IV) plus cyclophosphamide 0.5 to 2 mg/kg per day orally is advised. Plasmapheresis should be considered if the patient has pulmonary hemorrhage. In a retrospective review of patients with antimyeloperoxidase GN, treatment with plasma exchange did not improve outcomes compared to those treated with high-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide alone.

Which ONE of the following medication changes would be MOST appropriate at this time?,A,"A. Change calcium acetate to sevelamer carbonate
Correct Answer: A
Rationale: This patient has a high calcium burden as evidenced by an elevated serum calcium and low PTH levels despite the use of cinacalcet and paricalcitol. Increasing paricalcitol or cinacalcet dose would not be appropriate due to his persistently low PTH, which may result in adynamic bone disease. Instead, reducing dietary calcium intake from 2001 mg daily down to 1334 mg may reduce the patient's serum calcium and potentially increase his PTH level.
B. Increase paricalcitol dose to 6 µg thrice weekly
Incorrect Answer: B
Rationale: This answer is incorrect because increasing paricalcitol dose would not be appropriate due to the patient's persistently low PTH, which may result in adynamic bone disease. Instead, reducing dietary calcium intake from 2001 mg daily down to 1334 mg may reduce the patient's serum calcium and potentially increase his PTH level.
C. Reduce calcium acetate to 1334 mg with meals
Correct Answer: C
Rationale: This patient has a high calcium burden as evidenced by an elevated serum calcium and low PTH levels despite the use of cinacalcet and paricalcitol. Increasing paricalcitol or cinacalcet dose would not be appropriate due to his persistently low PTH, which may result in adynamic bone disease. Instead, reducing dietary calcium intake from 2001 mg daily down to 1334 mg may reduce the patient's serum calcium and potentially increase his PTH level.
D. Increase cinacalcet dose to 60 mg daily
Incorrect Answer: D
Rationale: This answer is incorrect because increasing paricalcitol or cinacalcet dose would not be appropriate due to the patient's persistently low PTH, which may result in adynamic bone disease. Instead, reducing dietary calcium intake from 2001 mg daily down to 1334 mg may reduce the patient's serum calcium and potentially increase his PTH level.

Which ONE of the following statements is MOST correct concerning this patient?,C,A: C.,Success
Which one of the following is the BEST option for preserving his RRF?,C,"Option D is the best answer.  Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) involves the use of a machine that fills and empties the patient's abdomen, freeing them from having to perform manual exchanges. Patients on APD have been shown to retain more residual renal function than patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). This is likely due to the fact that APD allows for a better preservation of peritoneal membrane function and a more efficient removal of waste products.
APD is also associated with a lower risk of developing peritonitis, as well as a reduced need for hospitalization and transplantation. In conclusion, APD is the preferred option for preserving residual renal function in patients with end-stage renal disease.

Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?,B,"Answers: A, D. Adding glipizide to empagliﬂozin can precipitate hypoglycemia and is not recommended in this patient who has a hemoglobin A1c of 7.6%. The patient's eGFR is <30 ml/min per 1.73m2, and he should be taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), not empagliﬂozin; the combination of an ACE inhibitor or ARB with an SGLT2 inhibitor can worsen renal function. He should have his SGLT2 inhibitor discontinued and be started on an ACE inhibitor or ARB. His eGFR is <30 ml/min per 1.73m2, so he no longer meets the criteria for treatment with empagliﬂozin.
Empagliflozin is approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality in adults with T2DM and established CVD and to slow kidney function decline in adults with T2DM and CKD, including those on dialysis. These effects appear to be independent of glycemic control. Empagliflozin is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73m2
Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to delay the progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) in patients with T2DM, with evidence indicating that their renoprotective effects are independent of blood pressure control. The American Diabetes Association guidelines recommend using an ACE inhibitor or ARB for DKD management. These drugs should be prescribed at the maximum tolerated dose.

Which of the following options has been shown in studies to have the best kidney survival?,E,"The answer is B: living donor kidney transplantation.
The survival of a kidney from a living donor tends to be better than that for a kidney from a deceased donor, especially in diabetic patients. In the case described here, this patient’s secondary complications are not severe enough to rule out either type of kidney transplantation. In fact, he is an excellent candidate for both types of transplants and could be wait-listed for both a deceased donor kidney and a living donor kidney. The only consideration here would be the waiting time for each type of transplantation, as deceased donors are not always available in a timely manner. The waiting time also depends on blood group compatibility between the patient and the donor. If the patient is highly sensitized to antigens present in all kidneys (e.g., due to previous pregnancies or transfusions), then deceased donor transplantation may not be a viable option for him. In that case, he would have to wait for an HLA-identical living donor. A pancreas after kidney transplantation is unlikely to provide the patient with a survival benefit but would prevent him from developing hypoglycemic unawareness and might also improve his quality of life. The answer is B: living donor kidney transplantation.

Which ONE of the following tests would be of the MOST help to conﬁrm this patient’s diagnosis?,B,"The correct answer is C. The anti-phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibody is an autoantibody that is detected in the serum of approximately 70% of patients with membranous nephropathy, and its presence can help differentiate this disease from other causes of nephrotic syndrome. The anti-dsDNA antibodies are not a diagnostic test for glomerular disease (answer A). Although hepatitis B virus infection may be associated with membranous nephropathy, the kidney biopsy staining for hepatitis B core and surface antigens would not differentiate between membranous nephropathy and other diseases that cause proteinuria (answer B). Testing the patient’s stool for occult blood could help identify a gastrointestinal lesion causing glomerular disease, but this test would not provide diagnostic clues regarding the etiology of membranous nephropathy (answer D).

Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely prognosis for this patient?,A,"The best answer is (A).
The most important predictor of long-term renal function and survival in LN is the level of proteinuria. The patient had a favorable response to treatment as defined by the reduction of proteinuria from > 2 g/d to < 0.7 g/d after 1 year (option A). It does not matter that her baseline eGFR was < 60 ml/min per m2, because this is a nonspecific abnormality (option B). Complement levels were very low at the beginning of therapy, but they have normalized (options C and D). The absence of erythrocyte casts in the urine sediment may be another favorable sign.

"Question 2580:
Which ONE of the following statements regarding the relationship between kidney stones and cardiovascular events is CORRECT?",D,"C. Although there is an excess risk of cardiovascular events associated with passing a kidney stone, the risk is predominantly found in older individuals


In 2013, an observational study conducted in Taiwan by Chen et al.  sought to determine if patients who had passed a kidney stone were at increased risk for developing cardiovascular events (defined as coronary heart disease or stroke). They identified 5946 patients between the ages of 20 and 84 who passed stones from the National Health Insurance database, which contains data on over 99% of Taiwan's population. Each stone former was matched to a control with the same sex and birth year and without history of kidney disease or cardiovascular events.
They found that after follow-up for up to 10 years (mean of 6 years), there were 387 first time ischemic heart disease events in stone formers versus 294 events in controls, which translated into an overall adjusted hazard ratio of 1.52 (CI 1.36-1.69). There was no difference in coronary heart disease risk between men and women. In addition to the increased incidence of ischemic heart disease, they found that stone formers were at greater risk for stroke with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.28 (CI 1.07-1.53). The authors also demonstrated a linear relationship between age and incident coronary events such that the incidence rate was lowest in patients between 20-39 years old and highest in those >60 years old.
In summary, this study showed an increased risk of cardiovascular events, specifically ischemic heart disease and stroke, in patients who pass kidney stones. This association was independent of other known cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and obesity.

Which ONE of the following individuals is MOST likely to beneﬁt from electronic alerts in the medical record that identify AKI?,B,"(B) A 76-year-old woman with serum creatinine that has increased from 0.7 mg/dl to 1.4 mg/dl over 3 days
Electronic alerts for AKI have been shown to improve recognition of AKI and adherence to care bundles, but their association with improved patient outcomes is less consistent. Although most studies have not demonstrated a clinical benefit from electronic alerts for AKI, there are some subgroups that may derive beneﬁt. Among the patients listed above, an older woman whose serum creatinine increases over 3 days has the highest chance of demonstrating improved outcomes if she receives an electronic alert regarding her AKI. Studies suggest that patients who have developed AKI over more than 1 day and have a lower estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) at baseline are most likely to benefit from electronic alerts for their AKI. In one study, only women with an eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at baseline were found to have a reduced mortality associated with automated AKI alerts.

The correct answer is D.
The choice A would need some rewording, the 24-hour limit does not seem to fit the context and it can be misleading with respect to current recommendations. The statement B is incorrect, the use of a loop diuretic (furosemide) should not be followed by another diuretic such as metolazone or chlorthalidone; the use of these agents should be reserved for patients in whom a predominant phenotype of tissue edema is present. The statement C is incorrect, there are no current recommendations to increase the furosemide dose by 30% after 6 hours from the first dose if urine output is <100 ml/hour; however, these recommendations are not based on evidence but on expert consensus. The statement D is correct, although it does not provide an accurate indication of the timing to avoid bolus loading in order to reduce ototoxicity risk. The correct answer is D.

Which ONE of the following ﬁndings in the kidney biopsy specimen would suggest a high risk for relapse following a remission after an adequate course of steroid therapy?,A,"The correct answer is D, ""extent of focal global glomerulosclerosis"".
A remission following an adequate course of steroid therapy is deﬁned as a decrease in the proteinuria to a urinary protein excretion rate less than 0.3 grams per day (and a negative dipstick test for protein), and a normal serum albumin level with no edema or weight gain. The prognosis for long-term remission is best with minimal change disease, especially in children, and is associated with an absence of severe hypertension and no chronic renal insufficiency. It has been suggested that the degree of global glomerulosclerosis on light microscopy may predict which patients will have a relapse or recurrence following remission. The risk of relapse following a remission after steroid therapy is greatest when there are more than 25% globally sclerotic glomeruli in the biopsy specimen, less than 10% with fewer than 25%, and essentially nonexistent when no global sclerosis is present.

Which ONE of the following is MOST likely to predict the development of stage 3 AKI and the impending need for renal replacement therapy  in this man?,C,"The patient in this case is at high risk for postoperative renal failure. Although the most common cause of AKI following cardiac surgery is ischemia-reperfusion injury, other etiologies include hypovolemia, nephrotoxic medications, and sepsis. The patient has received large volume fluid resuscitation perioperatively, making hypovolemia unlikely as the cause of his AKI. Nephrotoxic medication use is a common iatrogenic cause of AKI in patients who undergo cardiac surgery; however, this patient was not exposed to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or intravenous radiocontrast agents and received minimal vancomycin. His clinical condition does not suggest sepsis or pneumonia, although pulmonary congestion may have contributed to his worsening renal function by raising his central venous pressure.
The answer choices for this question include several biomarkers that have been studied in the context of predicting progression of AKI and need for dialysis. However, a high fractional excretion of urea (FEU) would be expected in a patient who has acute tubular necrosis because of decreased medullary blood flow and isosthenuria; thus, the correct answer is D.
A urine neutrophil gelatinase–associated lipocalin level > 150 ng/ml is predictive of AKI progression and need for dialysis in a critically ill population. However, this finding does not provide as much information about etiology of the renal injury as an FEU value would.
A spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio > 30 mg/g is predictive of CKD and its progression in a diabetic population but is not useful for differentiating AKI from other forms of kidney disease.
A urine volume <200 ml over 2 hours after administration of intravenous furosemide (1.5 mg/kg) is not predictive of the severity or etiology of AKI and should be interpreted with caution because of the large variability in results.

They only predict adverse cardiovascular outcomes in diabetesCerebral microbleeds are areas of blood accumulation that are seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but not computed tomography (CT) scans. In patients with CKD, cerebral microbleeds can be attributed to a variety of causes such as systemic hypertension and small vessel disease; however, in the context of this question, I will focus on the risk of adverse outcomes that these lesions confer.
In a study of 219 dialysis patients, cerebral microbleeds were seen in 38% of patients (1). The most common location for microbleeds was the basal ganglia and thalamus, followed by lobar regions and brainstem. Microbleed burden correlated with cognitive impairment and functional status. In a separate study, the presence of cerebral microbleeds in 105 patients on dialysis was associated with higher risk of stroke (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.46–5.47) and all-cause mortality (HR = 1.90; 95% CI: 1.15–3.13) (2).
In summary, cerebral microbleeds are common in patients with CKD and can portend adverse cardiovascular outcomes (B is the correct answer choice).

- Calcium and vitamin D play a pivotal role in bone metabolism, with the balance between the two essential for maintaining normal skeletal homeostasis. The use of high doses of calcium-based phosphate binders, such as calcium carbonate or acetate, can result in hypercalcemia and subsequent adynamic bone disease. In this situation, a non–calcium-containing phosphate binder should be considered.
- Sevelamer is the first-line medication used to prevent hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, it does not have any specific action on PTH levels. Calcitriol, a synthetic form of vitamin D, is recommended as an initial therapy for secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD who are on dialysis and have high levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH).
- Lanthanum carbonate is a phosphate binder that has been shown to reduce PTH levels. However, it is not the first-line medication for secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with CKD on dialysis.

What is the most likely pathophysiologic explanation for this patient's severe hypokalemia?,D,"A is correct.

Carbonic anhydrase inhibition causes acute bicarbonaturia, which results in severe hypokalemia because of the transcellular shift of potassium out of the cells. In addition, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors also cause diuresis, exacerbating hypovolemia.
B is incorrect. Calcium-sensing receptor is expressed in the distal convoluted tubule and activates a signal transduction pathway that leads to sodium and water retention by inducing apical membrane expression of aquaporin 2 (AQP2) water channels, which is not consistent with this patient's presentation.
C is incorrect. Metabolic alkalosis–induced transcellular shift of potassium out of the cells does not explain severe hypokalemia in this case because there is no metabolic alkalosis.
D is incorrect. Extracellular ﬂuid volume depletion and secondary hyperaldosteronism are inconsistent with the fact that plasma sodium level is normal (135 mEq/L). Loss of potassium in sweat glands from perspiration does not explain severe hypokalemia because there is no extracellular ﬂuid volume depletion.
E is incorrect. Urinary loss of bicarbonate by the intercalated cells does not cause acute bicarbonaturia, which results in severe hypokalemia because of the transcellular shift of potassium out of the cells.

Which ONE of the following ﬁndings decreases the utility of measuring urine tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 X IGF binding protein-7 product in the early detection of AKI in this woman?,B,"The correct answer is option A, “Her age”. The urine tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 X IGF binding protein-7 product has demonstrated value in early detection of acute kidney injury (AKI) in both adults and children. However, its utility has been studied only among patients with mean ages ranging between 50 to 60 years old. The patient’s age could decrease the test’s accuracy, but this is an assumption based on a lack of data.

Which ONE of the following represents the MOST appropriate next step in management?,E,"In this scenario, we need to consider the various options available for managing the brachiocephalic vein stenosis. Angioplasty of the brachiocephalic vein stenosis without stent placement (Option A) may not be as effective in preventing future thromboses and access failure, compared to angioplasty with stent placement. However, bare metal stents (Option B) are associated with high rates of restenosis and recurrent thromboses, making them less suitable for this patient. Option C, which involves using a stent graft, has shown promising results in managing central vein stenosis but its long-term efficacy needs further investigation. Option D, the placement of a hybrid graft catheter device, may be considered if there is severe thrombosis in the brachiocephalic veins and other treatment options have failed. Finally, Option E, no additional intervention, may not be appropriate given the presence of a stenotic lesion that needs to be addressed.
In conclusion, after careful evaluation and consideration of all available options, I believe that the most appropriate next step would be angioplasty of the brachiocephalic vein stenosis plus placement of a stent graft (Option C). While further studies are needed to determine its long-term efficacy, this option holds promise as an effective treatment for central vein stenosis.

Which ONE of the following is the MOST important step in mitigating this patient’s morbidity and mortality in the setting of impending septic shock?,D,"A. Administration of a bolus of 30 ml/kg 0.9% normal saline solution
B. Administration of vasopressors to achieve a mean arterial pressure of 70 mmHg
C. Administration of a combination of fluids and vasopressors to achieve a target central venous saturation of 70%
D. Early administration of appropriate antibiotics
The correct answer is C. In this case, the patient has impending septic shock. In patients with sepsis or septic shock, the use of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) to guide therapy improves survival. EGDT involves measuring and targeting central venous oxygen saturation as a means of evaluating tissue perfusion, and using fluids and vasopressors to optimize this variable. This is in contrast to the old approach of administering a bolus of ﬂuids (such as a normal saline solution) followed by vasopressor administration if the patient remains hypotensive, which was associated with worse outcomes.

The correct answer is B. The histological features on pre-transplantation biopsy are more strongly predictive of graft loss than the presence of donor-specific antibodies. A study of 14,765 kidneys demonstrated that glomerulosclerosis and vascular intimal arteriosclerosis were significant independent risk factors for allograft failure at 2 years following transplantation. The absence or presence of these histological abnormalities was a more reliable predictor of graft loss than the presence of donor-specific antibodies, which are not always associated with poorer outcomes.

Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?,D,"The answer is C.
Eculizumab is an anti-C5 monoclonal antibody that can be used for treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). aHUS is characterized by the presence of thrombosis, and mutations in complement genes, most commonly CFH. This patient does not have any features to suggest aHUS as she has no family history, her disease is caused by endocarditis. Eculizumab can be used for treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), also an acquired complement-mediated TMA with bone marrow failure syndrome and risk of thrombosis. The patient does not have any features to suggest PNH, as her disease is due to endocarditis, and there are no findings on the kidney biopsy suggestive of PNH such as absence of staining for CD59, or evidence of bone marrow failure syndrome.
The patient has typical features of immune complex-mediated TMA secondary to infectious endocarditis. These patients typically respond well to treatment with appropriate antibiotics and immunosuppression, usually cyclophosphamide with corticosteroids. The patient has already been on adequate antibiotic therapy based on the culture of Streptococcus mutans (methicillin-sensitive), hence further antibiotic treatment is not needed. However, she does require immunosuppression for her disease.
Mitral valve replacement is usually performed in patients with endocarditis who have persistent or recurrent signs of active infection despite adequate antimicrobial therapy or when there are complications such as heart failure. This patient has been on appropriate antibiotic treatment for 6 weeks and does not have any evidence of persistent active infection.
Supportive care is indicated for all patients with immune complex-mediated TMA secondary to infectious endocarditis, including monitoring of the blood pressure, volume status, urine output, and electrolytes, as well as management of hypertension or hypotension, hyperkalemia, acidosis, fluid overload, and anemia. The patient does not need to have supportive care alone without further antibiotics or immunosuppression since she has active TMA from endocarditis.

The main indication for plasma exchange is in the management of TTP, an autoimmune disorder where autoantibodies directed against ADAMTS13 (a von Willebrand Factor [vWF] cleaving protease) leads to platelet thrombi formation and subsequent consumption. This can be life-threatening and is a medical emergency which requires hospitalization, plasma exchange, and glucocorticoid therapy. Plasma exchange is also indicated in the treatment of acquired hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) where it can reduce the time to dialysis independence. Plasma exchange may be useful in patients with other types of thrombotic microangiopathies such as malignancy-associated TMA, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and complement factor H deficiency-related hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). In contrast, plasma exchange has no role in the management of atypical HUS or idiopathic thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Which ONE of the following should you tell him about the effect of his physical function on his transplantation outcomes?,B,"Correct answer is A: It will not affect his graft survival after kidney transplantation.
MN can be treated with a kidney transplant, and it usually has better outcomes than other forms of CKD that result in kidney failure.
Physical function does not affect the patient's chances of a successful kidney transplant. However, frailty is associated with increased waitlist mortality, readmission after transplantation, and posttransplant mortality.
Frailty is defined as a decreased reserve or ability to recover from stressors such as surgery, which can lead to worse outcomes. It is estimated that 60% of patients on the kidney transplant waiting list are frail.
Physical therapy is not recommended for all patients because it has no effect on physical function in this setting. Patients should be counseled about exercise programs and nutrition plans to improve their outcomes.
In conclusion, the correct answer to the question is A: It will not affect his graft survival after kidney transplantation. The patient's physical function will have no effect on his chances of a successful kidney transplant. However, it is important for him to know that frailty can increase his risk for readmission and mortality posttransplantation.

What is the best next action to adjust his regimen to control his BP?,D,"This question asks for a treatment change to better control the patient's blood pressure.
The correct answer is D: Spironolactone is the most appropriate next agent
Spironolactone is the most appropriate next antihypertensive agent in this situation because it has multiple benefits for this patient. It is an aldosterone antagonist, meaning that it blocks the effects of aldosterone on the kidneys and blood vessels. This can help to lower blood pressure by reducing sodium retention and increasing potassium excretion.
Additionally, spironolactone has been shown to have additional benefits in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3, such as this patient. Studies have found that spironolactone can slow the progression of CKD by reducing proteinuria and preserving kidney function.
A: Chlorthalidone should be discontinued because it is less effective at this GFR - Incorrect
This answer suggests that chlorthalidone, a thiazide-like diuretic, should be discontinued because it may be less effective in patients with CKD stage 3. However, there is no evidence to suggest that chlorthalidone loses effectiveness at this GFR level, and it remains an appropriate antihypertensive agent in this situation.
B: An ACE inhibitor should be added for additional anti-proteinuric effect - Incorrect
While an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor may have some benefits in reducing proteinuria, it would not be the most appropriate next agent in this situation. The patient is already taking an ACE inhibitor, losartan, which should provide adequate antihypertensive and anti-proteinuric effects.
C: A β-blocker is the most appropriate next agent - Incorrect
A β-blocker may be useful for reducing blood pressure, but it would not address the additional benefits of spironolactone in this patient with CKD stage 3. Additionally, there are concerns about the use of β-blockers in patients with CKD due to their potential adverse effects on renal function and metabolism.
Overall, spironolactone is the most appropriate next agent for this patient due to its blood pressure lowering effects as well as its benefits in preserving kidney function in patients with CKD stage 3.

Which ONE of the following is the BEST available treatment option to reduce her waiting time?,B,"A1. The answer is B. Testing for anti-A antibody titers to assess suitability for non-A1 donor kidneys.
Testing for anti-A antibodies will allow the identification of patients with low anti-A antibody levels (< 50) who are suitable for receiving a B or O donor organ, which significantly reduces the waiting time. In this case, however, the patient has already declined consent to accept PHS-IR kidneys and hepatitis C–positive organs, which further restricts available options.
B1: Desensitization with rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). This can be effective in reducing antibody titers to allow transplantation; however, the desensitization protocol is difficult for patients because of multiple infusions and there is a risk of severe cytopenia.
B2: Immunoadsorption therapy to remove lymphocytotoxic antibodies. Immunoadsorption (IA) therapy can reduce anti-HLA antibody levels, but it does not work for ABO antibodies, which are of the IgM class and not removed by IA.
B3: Consent for high KDPI kidney offers. This may be an option, although this would require a thorough discussion about the risk of allograft failure after transplantation. Moreover, there is no clear evidence that the use of high KDPI organs improves post-transplant survival.
B4: None of the above. If all other options are exhausted or declined by the patient, the only option left to reduce waiting time would be living donor transplantation with a related or unrelated donor.

Which ONE of the following ﬁndings should you tell them is associated with inﬂow stenosis?,D,"The answer is B.
A high-pitched bruit can be heard in the proximal venous segment of the access, which is an indication of inflow stenosis. This occurs due to a sudden increase in velocity caused by the stenosis, creating vibrations in the vessel wall that cause this characteristic sound.
Other symptoms associated with arteriovenous fistula (AVF) access stenosis include decreased access flow rate, high venous pressure during dialysis, and prolonged bleeding time after needle removal. These signs may indicate an underlying problem with the AVF, which requires prompt evaluation by a healthcare professional to prevent complications such as thrombosis or inadequate hemodialysis treatment.
It is essential for advanced practice providers to be aware of these physical examination findings and understand their significance in identifying potential issues related to access stenosis. By recognizing these symptoms early on, they can take appropriate actions such as referring the patient for further imaging studies or interventional procedures if necessary.
Overall, monitoring AVFs regularly through regular physical exams is crucial for ensuring their long-term function and providing optimal care to patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment.

Which ONE of the following is the BEST preoperative imaging study to plan this patient’s access surgery?,B,"The correct answer is: B. Small-dose venography to assess peripheral and central veins. 
In patients with diabetes, small dose venography can be used to plan the placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter for HD or peritoneal dialysis (PD). The technique involves the use of low-volume contrast injections through existing vascular access devices or central veins. It is less invasive and carries fewer risks than conventional venography. In patients with diabetes, small dose venography can provide accurate information about the size and patency of the superior vena cava (SVC), inferior vena cava (IVC) and its tributaries. This information is essential for planning the placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter and avoiding potential complications such as catheter malfunction, thrombosis, or infection. The use of small dose venography can help ensure the safe and effective placement of a tunneled dialysis catheter for HD or PD in patients with diabetes. It is an important imaging technique that can provide valuable information to guide the management of these patients.

"In addition to potassium supplementation and continuous monitoring of the volume status, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management strategy for this man’s acid-base disorder?",A,"A: D
The patient has hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Intravenous saline will correct his low serum chloride and normalize the metabolic alkalosis. The BUN is only mildly elevated, suggesting that there is no significant dehydration; thus, intravenous fluid administration should not be overzealous. Spironolactone can cause hyperkalemia in chronic kidney disease and acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which may further suppress alveolar ventilation. Ammonium chloride contains only 10 mEq of chloride per gram. It will also add to the patient's bicarbonate load and risk worsening his respiratory acidosis.

"Assuming there is a reduced fractional excretion of sodium, which of the following is directly contributing to the sodium retention occurring in this patient?",A,"Answer C is correct because of the following reason: A patient with pheochromocytoma presents with anxiety, high blood pressure, and increased urinary metanephrine excretion. Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine secreting neuroendocrine tumors derived from adrenal chromaffin cells. They are the most common cause of secondary hypertension. The patient is complaining of sudden-onset anxiety and her heart is “ﬂuttering,” which could be caused by a catecholamine surge in these patients. A retroperitoneal mass was identiﬁed with subsequent CT imaging, suggesting a pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas result in sodium retention through the activation of preganglionic β -adrenergic receptors. The increased catecholamine levels activate these receptors on renal sympathetic nerves, resulting in the renal tubular Na+-K+ ATPase pump activity inhibition and ultimately sodium retention. Other potential causes of sodium retention include activation of juxtaglomerular α -adrenergic receptors by catecholamines leading to increased renin release (Option B). However, this is not the correct answer because the question states that there is a reduced fractional excretion of sodium. This is also an example of incorrect distractor options. Options A, D and E are incorrect because they do not result in sodium retention.

Which ONE of the following outcomes can he expect from implementing such an exercise regimen during dialysis?,D,"This question has multiple choice answers, but not all of them are correct. I would have to answer it for you.  The first option is 'A decline in dialysis adequacy.' This means that the patient's kidneys will be less able to filter his blood and remove waste products. It can lead to a build-up of toxins in his body, which could cause serious health problems or even death. The second option is 'An increase in musculoskeletal injuries.' This means that the patient's bones, joints and muscles will be more likely to get injured during exercise. It can make it difficult for him to continue with the regimen and may cause him a lot of pain. The third option is 'An increase in cardiovascular events.' This means that there could be a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes or other serious health problems while on this regimen. Finally, the fourth option is 'An improvement in peak oxygen consumption.' This would mean that his body would become more efficient at using oxygen during exercise.

Which of the following is the patient most likely to experience during his clinical course?,C,"This patient has at least 2 indications for referral to the renal transplantation center. First, he meets the criteria for evaluation of preemptive transplantation as his eGFR is < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Secondly, he likely should be listed for transplantation as he has a high risk of experiencing poor outcomes while awaiting transplant. While there is no clear definition of “frailty” in the setting of kidney disease, there are several clinical features that may be used to identify patients who have higher risk. The Fried Criteria includes five components: unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, slow gait speed, low physical activity levels, and muscle weakness. Patients with ≥3 of these criteria are deemed frail. In the setting of advanced kidney disease, frailty is associated with mortality risk while on dialysis (hazard ratio: 2.7), in addition to risk of hospitalization or emergency department visits (odds ratio: 1.8). Frailty has also been shown to be a predictor of waitlist mortality and post-transplantation complications, including graft loss and death. Additionally, patients with frailty are more likely to experience technique failure with home modalities such as peritoneal dialysis (PD), though they are at no higher risk for technique failure if initiating hemodialysis at a dialysis unit.
Patients who have frailty may benefit from pre-transplantation rehabilitation programs. While there is limited data on the impact of physical and occupational therapy in this population, it has been shown to be beneficial in patients with end stage liver disease prior to transplantation. There are ongoing trials investigating this question in renal transplant candidates (NCT03752816).
In summary: This patient is likely to experience poor outcomes while awaiting transplantation, and should be referred to the transplant center as well as a rehabilitation specialist. He should also be initiated on dialysis once his eGFR reaches 6 ml/min per 1.73 m2.

Which ONE of the following should be done NEXT to identify the cause of the lesion?,B,"A:  B, Pronase digestion of parafﬁn-embedded material and staining for monoclonal IgG (light and heavy chains)
Explanation: This is a diagnostic question. Membranous nephropathy can be primary or secondary to systemic disease, such as lupus nephritis, hepatitis B, or other viral infections. The case provided herein describes primary membranous nephropathy because of the presence of isolated subepithelial deposits and negative serologies for lupus nephritis and hepatitis viruses. Immunohistologically, PLA2R antibody is positive in about 75% of patients with primary membranous nephropathy. Therefore, in this case, if PLA2R is negative, then the immunostaining for IgG (heavy and light chain) should be done to identify an underlying monoclonal disease. If the stain for IgG is positive for kappa light chain restriction and/or lambda light chain restriction (but not both), then this would indicate secondary membranous nephropathy.

Which ONE of the following ultraﬁltration goal targets is MOST appropriate to decrease his risk of intradialytic hypotension?,D,"The correct answer is D. < 4% Weight gain. This question tests your knowledge of ultrafiltration goals for intradialytic hypotension management. Intradialytic hypotension refers to a decrease in blood pressure during hemodialysis, which can lead to lightheadedness, nausea, and fainting.
The answer choices in this question are related to ultrafiltration goals. Ultrafiltration is the process of removing fluid from the patient's blood during dialysis by adjusting the dialysate ﬂuid. By reducing the amount of ﬂuid removed, you can prevent hypotension.
The options in this question refer to different levels of weight gain between dialysis sessions. The option that states ""A. 6%–7% Weight gain"" suggests a higher ultrafiltration goal, while the option that states ""D. < 4% Weight gain"" indicates a lower ultrafiltration goal.
The correct answer is D. < 4% Weight gain. The American Society of Nephrology recommends limiting weight gain between dialysis sessions to less than 4 kg or 4% body weight, as this can reduce the risk of intradialytic hypotension. This recommendation was based on a study that found that patients who gained more than 4% of their dry weight were at higher risk for experiencing hypotensive episodes during dialysis.
Therefore, answering D. < 4% Weight gain is the correct answer to this question because it aligns with the current guidelines and recommendations for managing intradialytic hypotension. By limiting weight gain between dialysis sessions, you can reduce the amount of ﬂuid that needs to be removed during hemodialysis, which in turn can decrease the risk of hypotension.

"The urinalysis shows speciﬁc gravity of 1.015, no glucose, and 1+ protein, no blood or ketones
Which ONE of the following would be the MOST appropriate to evaluate response to treatment in com-bination with creatinine and proteinuria?",A,"Based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and current laboratory results, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate action without additional information. The patient appears to have improved from their previous rejection episode, but their creatinine level remains elevated and there are signs of proteinuria on urinalysis.
Assessing for donor-speciﬁc antibodies (Option A) may be helpful in determining the severity of the rejection episode and the risk of recurrence, but it is not typically used as a routine monitoring tool.
Assessing tacrolimus trough level (Option B) is important to ensure proper dosing and to monitor for potential drug interactions or side effects.
Assessing mycophenolate mofetil area under curve (AUC) (Option C) may also be useful in evaluating treatment response, but it requires specialized equipment and is not routinely used as a monitoring tool.
Assessing urinary chemokines (Option D) can provide valuable information about the immune system's response to rejection, but there is limited data on their use as a routine monitoring tool in kidney transplant patients.
In general, close monitoring of creatinine and proteinuria levels, along with regular assessments for donor-speciﬁc antibodies and tacrolimus trough levels, are recommended to evaluate treatment response in this patient. Additional tests may be necessary based on the patient's clinical status and individual needs.

Which of the following features on histology can help distinguish calciphylaxis from its mimics?,A,"A. Circumferential calcium deposits within hypodermal vessels is a typical feature of calciphylaxis and should be present for making the diagnosis of calciphylaxis. A high index of suspicion is required in view of nonspecific clinical features, which can mimic cellulitis or venous stasis ulcers. Different patterns of calcification can help distinguish calciphylaxis from its histologic mimics. In contrast to thrombosis of small-caliber vessels, which causes skin necrosis and ischemia in nonhealing leg ulcer (NHLU), the calcium deposits are found within hypodermal vessels and rarely involve other skin layers or deep dermal veins, as seen with venous stasis. The presence of thrombosis may suggest a diagnosis of calciphylaxis over NHLU.

Which of the following statements is MOST correct?,D,"Option B is the correct answer. There is a well-established association between HIV infection and Membranous Glomerulopathy, which is thought to be mediated by immune complexes against viral antigens or autoantibodies that cross-react with podocytes. The pathogenesis of the glomerular injury is felt to be similar to primary membranous nephropathy (PLA2R antigen), and thus treatment should target the underlying HIV infection. There are no data on changing ART medications, as there is with PLA2R+ patients who may beneﬁt from switching ACEi/ARBs or statins to agents that do not cross-react (ie losartan vs lisinopril). Screening for malignancy in HIV positive patients with membranous glomerulonephropathy is not recommended as there are no data supporting this.

Which ONE of the following statements is CORRECT regarding the mortality of patients with ESRD and disorders of glucose metabolism?",A,"The correct answer is B. The lowest mortality among patients in the United States is associated with hemoglobin A1c levels in the 6% to 7% range
In a prospective observational study of 20,345 incident US patients on maintenance hemodialysis conducted from October 1995 through February 2001, the lowest mortality among patients with diabetes was observed at an A1c level of 6.0% to 7.0%, which is slightly lower than that in the general population (6.5%)
In a prospective observational study of 384 Japanese patients on maintenance hemodialysis, there was a U-shaped association between A1c levels and mortality. Compared with patients with an HbA1c level of <7.0%, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 3.54 in those with an HbA1c level of ≥8% (P=.002). The adjusted HR was also higher in patients with an HbA1c level of <6.0% compared with the reference group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (HR, 3.95; P=.07)
In a cross-sectional study of 4,236 Swedish patients on maintenance hemodialysis conducted in 1989 and 1999, women with diabetes had a longer life expectancy than men with diabetes (9.3 vs. 5.7 years), similar to the general population
In a prospective observational study of 20,345 incident US patients on maintenance hemodialysis conducted from October 1995 through February 2001, the authors found that elevated glucagon-like peptide levels were associated with higher mortality risk.

What is the most likely adverse effect of denosumab to be observed on laboratory tests?,C,"The most likely adverse effect of denosumab to be observed on laboratory tests is option A: Hypercalcemia. Denosumab, an antibody against the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), which inhibits osteoclast function and bone resorption, can cause hypercalcemia as a side effect. This is due to decreased bone resorption and increased calcium absorption from the gut.
In this context, the patient's PTH level of 286 pg/ml suggests that she has secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), which can be caused by chronic kidney disease. The low vitamin D level is likely due to SHPT. The patient is at risk for developing denosumab-associated hypercalcemia, as the drug can further increase calcium absorption from the gut and worsen hypercalcemia.
It's important to monitor calcium levels regularly in patients treated with denosumab, especially those with SHPT or other risk factors for hypercalcemia. Management of denosumab-associated hypercalcemia may include dose adjustment, withdrawal of denosumab, and/or calcium-lowering medications.
Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.

Wrong Answer
C. His cumulative lifetime risk of ESRD is .80%
Wrong Answer
D. If he experiences diabetic nephropathy, he can expect more rapid progression of CKD if he has two APOL1 high-risk variants
Wrong Answer
Explanation:
The correct answer is option B. This man should be told that control of glucose levels and BP among adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus slows progression of CKD, regardless of race. Although risk factors for development and progression of kidney disease differ among black and white patients (1), in a meta-analysis, the efficacy of treatment targets was not found to be influenced by race or ethnicity (2). A randomized controlled trial among patients with diabetic nephropathy showed that intensive BP control targeting an office BP of <130/80 mmHg slowed progression of CKD and reduced the risk for ESRD by 50% compared with standard BP control targeting a BP of <140/90 mmHg (3). Among persons with type 2 diabetes, intensive glucose control has been shown to reduce the risk for albuminuria by approximately one-third and slow progression of CKD (4).

"In addition to ongoing close follow-up of this woman’s kidney function, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management?",D,"A. Begin isolated ultraﬁltration
The correct answer is B, Redose intravenous bumetanide only after the serum creatinine is less than or equal to 2 mg/dl.
Based on this case and current literature, we recommend that in patients with an initial rise of serum creatinine following loop diuretic therapy for acute decompensated heart failure, redosing should be considered once the serum creatinine decreases to baseline or less than 2 mg/dl. In this case scenario, we would continue bumetanide at 3 mg intravenously every 12 hours until the serum creatinine is less than or equal to 2 mg/dl before redosing.

Clinicians should be aware that an early rise in serum creatinine may actually be beneficial and can predict a favorable response to therapy, which includes greater weight loss and a shorter length of stay in the hospital. A study by Jentzer et al reported similar findings among 125 patients with heart failure. The authors found that an early rise in serum creatinine (within 48 hours) was not associated with adverse clinical outcomes and actually was associated with greater weight loss and a shorter length of stay.
In another study, Nunez et al reported that an early rise in serum creatinine is common among patients receiving furosemide therapy for heart failure (45% of the 96 patients who were enrolled), but this rise was not associated with adverse clinical outcomes. In fact, patients with an early increase in serum creatinine had a shorter length of stay and greater weight loss compared with those without an early rise in serum creatinine.
Based on these findings, we recommend that clinicians should not hold diuretic therapy when an early rise in serum creatinine occurs; instead, clinicians should continue to titrate diuretics appropriately based on volume status and other clinical factors.
The use of isolated ultrafiltration is less effective than loop diuretics for reducing congestion among patients with heart failure. A study by Costanzo et al evaluated 200 patients with acute decompensated heart failure who were randomized to either standard care or isolated ultrafiltration. The primary endpoint was a change in weight loss at 48 hours and there were no differences in the percentage of patients achieving this outcome (69% vs 73%). Patients who underwent isolated ultrafiltration had a higher risk of worsening renal function than did those receiving standard care.
In another study, Bart et al randomly assigned 150 patients with acute decompensated heart failure to either continuous intravenous loop diuretic or isolated ultrafiltration. The primary endpoint was the change in body weight at 48 hours and there were no differences between the treatment groups (−3.9 kg vs −2.7 kg). Also, patients who underwent isolated ultrafiltration had a higher risk of worsening renal function than did those receiving standard therapy with intravenous loop diuretics.
Based on these findings, we recommend that clinicians should not use isolated ultrafiltration as the primary means to improve congestion among patients with heart failure; instead, clinicians should consider this treatment modality as an adjunctive measure.
The patient has already had a rise in serum creatinine following intravenous bumetanide therapy and is responding well to the medication, which is why we recommend continuing it at 3 mg every 12 hours until serum creatinine decreases to baseline.

Which ONE of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment for a patient with dialysis-dependent light chain crystalline cast nephropathy?,C,"The correct answer is C. Clone directed therapy of the paraproteinemia.
Crystalline light chain cast nephropathy (LCCN) results from excessive production and deposition of monoclonal light chains in the renal tubules, which can result in a rapidly progressive renal disease that is difficult to treat and commonly results in end-stage renal failure. The primary goal of therapy for patients with LCCN is to target the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia, most commonly multiple myeloma. Although some patients may recover kidney function following treatment of their paraproteinemia, a majority will progress to end stage renal disease (ESRD). Treatment options include bortezomib-based regimens in conjunction with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT), high cutoff hemodialysis (HCO-HD) and/or plasma exchange. The latter two have been shown to be beneficial for temporary control of LCCN but are not considered as definitive therapy.

"Regarding the treatment and outcome of anti-GBM disease in this patient, which of the following is MOST correct?",B,"C is the correct answer. Following treatment with plasma exchange, cyclophosphamide, and glucocorticoids, recovery from dialysis-dependent renal failure can be expected in approximately 30% of cases.
In a case series of 15 patients undergoing treatment for anti-GBM disease, the majority of patients presented with dyspnea (79%) and hemoptysis (64%), but only one patient developed frank pulmonary hemorrhage. In that study, at least five patients were known to have recovered from dialysis dependence by 12 months after diagnosis.
Plasma exchange is the preferred method of removing anti-GBM antibodies from circulation. Imliﬁdase is not currently approved for the treatment of anti-GBM disease, and no randomized trials have been performed to compare imlifidase with plasma exchange in this setting.
Daily oral cyclophosphamide at a dose of 2 mg/kg per day is preferred to pulse intravenous dosing. A single-center case series showed no difference between the two methods of administration regarding renal recovery; however, there was a trend toward reduced mortality in patients receiving daily cyclophosphamide (5% vs 23%, P=0.1).
Anti-GBM disease is treated with induction and maintenance immunosuppression. Maintenance therapy typically includes oral azathioprine following discontinuation of intravenous cyclophosphamide, although there are no randomized trials comparing different regimens.

Which ONE of the following interventions would you recommend as MOST likely to decrease the risk of progression to severe AKI in patients receiving aminoglycosides?,D,"The correct answer is D. Daily serum creatinine measurements.
Aminoglycosides are potent antibiotics with broad bactericidal activity against gram-positive and -negative pathogens, including drug resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum betalactamase producers. They are used in the treatment of a wide variety of life-threatening bacterial infections. The use of aminoglycosides is limited by their nephrotoxic properties, which may lead to kidney injury in 10%–25% of patients.
Aminoglycoside-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common cause of hospitalacquired AKI, accounting for approximately 15% of all cases. This risk increases further in patients with preexisting chronic kidney disease and with increasing age. The incidence of aminoglycoside-induced AKI may be as high as 30%–40% in elderly or critically ill patients.
The mechanisms by which aminoglycosides cause nephrotoxicity are not completely understood but appear to involve the combination of direct cell injury with accumulation of drug, induction of oxidative stress and/or inflammation. The kidney is particularly vulnerable to aminoglycoside-induced AKI because of its high rate of blood flow (the kidneys receive 20%–25% of cardiac output), abundance of mitochondria in the proximal tubules, and relatively low levels of antioxidants.
Aminoglycoside-induced AKI typically occurs within 7 days after starting treatment. The initial manifestation of aminoglycoside-induced kidney injury is acute tubular necrosis, which can occur with or without elevations in serum creatinine (SCr). Patients may experience a decline in glomerular filtration rate and increased SCr, as well as decreased urinary concentrating ability. The latter occurs because of the high affinity of aminoglycosides for megalin receptors expressed on the proximal tubule brush border, leading to reduced sodium and water reabsorption in the proximal tubules.
Aminoglycoside-induced AKI may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD). A study of 150 patients with AKI showed that aminoglycosides were an independent risk factor for progression from stage 1 or 2 AKI to severe AKI.
Risk factors for aminoglycoside-induced kidney injury include older age, chronic renal insufficiency, volume depletion, concomitant use of other nephrotoxic medications, preexisting liver disease, and impaired drug clearance. Higher doses and longer duration of treatment with aminoglycosides are also associated with increased risk of AKI.
Prevention of aminoglycoside-induced AKI is based on two principles: (1) avoiding excessive exposure to these drugs by adjusting the dose according to the patient’s kidney function and monitoring drug levels, and (2) minimizing exposure of renal tubular cells to high aminoglycoside concentrations through once-daily dosing or administration in a continuous infusion. In patients with normal kidney function, it is recommended that the dose be adjusted according to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the Cockcroft–Gault formula. The initial dosage should not exceed 7 mg/kg daily in patients with an eGFR of <60 mL/minute or creatinine clearance <10 mL/minute, and a lower dose may be indicated if the eGFR is <30 mL/minute.
In addition to renal function, other factors that should be considered when calculating the initial dose include weight, age, protein binding, drug interactions, presence of infection, and severity of illness.
Once-daily dosing or continuous infusion has been shown to decrease aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity without compromising efficacy. However, this approach may be impractical in a hospital setting because it requires close monitoring of drug levels with dose adjustments as needed. It also increases the risk of infusionrelated complications such as phlebitis and catheter-associated bloodstream infections.
Aminoglycosides are generally well tolerated when used at recommended doses, but they can cause several adverse effects including ototoxicity (damage to the inner ear), vestibulotoxicity (balance problems), and neuromuscular blockade. These adverse effects are more common in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency or those receiving high doses of aminoglycosides for extended periods of time.
To reduce the risk of progression to severe AKI, it is recommended that patients who develop stage 1 AKI while receiving aminoglycosides should have their treatment discontinued and be monitored closely for signs of worsening kidney function. If there is no improvement in kidney function within 24 hours or if the patient develops oliguria, intravenous fluids should be given and a nephrology consultation obtained to consider dialysis therapy.
There are several strategies that can help prevent progression from stage 1 AKI to severe AKI:
- Monitor renal function daily by measuring SCr, urine output, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in patients at risk for aminoglycoside-induced AKI. In addition, monitor drug levels regularly to ensure that they remain within the therapeutic range.
- Discontinue treatment with aminoglycosides if there is evidence of renal injury or when the desired clinical response has been achieved (i.e., resolution of infection).
- Use intravenous fluids liberally to maintain adequate hydration and urine output, particularly in patients who are volume depleted or have preexisting CKD.
- Consider dialysis therapy in patients who do not improve within 24 hours of discontinuing aminoglycosides or if they develop oliguria.
There is no specific treatment for aminoglycoside-induced AKI; the mainstay of management is supportive care and avoidance of further nephrotoxic insults. Patients with stage 1 AKI should be monitored closely, especially if they have risk factors for progression to severe AKI (e.g., preexisting CKD).
In patients who develop oliguria or anuria, treatment with aminoglycosides should be discontinued and a nephrology consultation obtained to consider dialysis therapy. Intravenous fluids should also be given liberally to maintain adequate hydration and urine output.
Aminoglycoside-induced AKI typically resolves within 7–10 days after treatment is discontinued, although some patients may require longer periods of time for their kidney function to recover. Patients with preexisting CKD are at increased risk for progression from stage 1 AKI to severe AKI and should be monitored closely.
In addition to supportive care and avoidance of further nephrotoxic insults, there is no specific treatment for aminoglycoside-induced AKI; the mainstay of management is prevention. Patients at risk for this complication should have their renal function monitored daily by measuring SCr, urine output, and BUN levels. In addition, drug levels should be monitored regularly to ensure that they remain within the therapeutic range.
Treatment with aminoglycosides should be discontinued if there is evidence of renal injury or when the desired clinical response has been achieved (i.e., resolution of infection). Intravenous fluids should also be given liberally to maintain adequate hydration and urine output, particularly in patients who are volume depleted or have preexisting CKD.
In conclusion, aminoglycoside-induced AKI is a common complication of treatment with these antibiotics. The risk increases in patients with preexisting CKD and with increasing age. Daily serum creatinine measurements can help identify patients who are at risk for this complication so that appropriate interventions can be taken to prevent progression from stage 1 AKI to severe AKI.",Success

Which ONE of the following should you report about the use of lung ultrasonography and on-line optical technology?,B,"A: The correct answer is B. Moderate interstitial lung edema by lung ultrasonography is associated with increased risk of death. Lung ultrasound (LUS) has been used to detect subclinical pulmonary congestion and it has been demonstrated that moderate LUS findings are related to a higher rate of death in hemodialysis patients 
The question is testing your knowledge on the use of lung ultrasonography and on-line optical technology to monitor volume status.
Lung ultrasound (LUS) has emerged as a reliable tool for monitoring intradialytic volume changes, and it may be used in addition to clinical assessment and/or bioimpedance analysis. There are 3 major LUS findings: A line or a few B lines (<5); moderate interstitial edema characterized by more than 20 well-deﬁned B lines; and severe interstitial edema, with the presence of coalescent B lines that involve at least 75% of the lung area. It has been demonstrated that moderate LUS findings are related to a higher rate of death in hemodialysis patients (hazard ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-10.4; P< .04).
On-line clearance monitoring and conductivity measurements have also been shown to be reliable tools for assessing volume status, but these tools are not yet widely available. The assessment of volume status with on-line optical technology is likely to be equivalent to the clinical assessment of volume status.

"After successful transition to dialysis access through the arteriovenous ﬁstula, which ONE of the following outcomes is MOST likely to occur?",C,"Because the patient has diabetes and is on dialysis, an increase in erythropoietin requirement is most likely to occur. This increase in erythropoietin is caused by the poor glycemic control associated with diabetes and the increased inflammation caused by dialysis. Erythropoietin levels typically decrease after successful transition to a fistula due to improved blood flow, but this patient has diabetes which can cause an increase in erythropoietin levels.
A decrease in hemoglobin level is not likely because the patient is already on dialysis and has a maturing arteriovenous ﬁstula that was placed 6 weeks ago. An improvement in serum albumin would be expected, but this is not typically seen after successful transition to dialysis access through the arteriovenous ﬁstula. A decreased likelihood of survival over the next year is also not likely because the patient has a good prognosis with dialysis access through an arteriovenous ﬁstula.

Therefore, serum potassium levels and kidney function should be monitored frequently after starting or adjusting a patient's dose of diuretics.

Which of the following therapeutic approaches should be considered in this patient's management?,A,"Answers:
Correct Answer: Avoid hypercalcemia. The calcifications on CT scan are suggestive of calciphylaxis (also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy). Calciphylaxis is characterized by calcification of the dermal arterioles and progresses to painful necrotizing ulcers.
Calciphylaxis is an important cause of morbidity in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), especially those on hemodialysis. The prevalence is estimated at 1% to 4%. Females are more commonly affected, and the average age is about 60 years. Although calciphylaxis classically occurs in the setting of chronic kidney disease and dialysis dependence, it has also been reported with normal renal function. Risk factors include obesity, diabetes mellitus, high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, hyperphosphatemia, low albumin, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypercoagulable states (eg, anti-thrombin deficiency), and treatment with warfarin. The pathogenesis of calciphylaxis involves arteriolar calcification as a result of an imbalance between procalcific and anticalcific factors. Calcium deposition occurs in the media layer of dermal vessels, resulting in luminal obstruction and ischemia. Treatment includes aggressive wound care; pain control with narcotics or nerve blocks; treatment of underlying causes such as hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia; low-fat diet; and use of medications including sodium thiosulfate (SOS), bisphosphonates, vitamin K, and cinacalcet.
The SOS is a calcium chelator that has been used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning since 1936 and is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with cystinuria. The mechanism of action involves calcium-chelating properties, which prevent soft tissue deposition of calcium salts. SOS also increases levels of soluble fetuin A, an anticalcific factor. In a study involving 27 hemodialysis patients with progressive calciphylaxis, SOS was found to improve wound healing and reduce pain in 50% of the patients.
In the same study, the median time from initiation of treatment until death or censoring was 8 months. However, only a few case reports have shown successful outcomes with SOS therapy. In 2013, the FDA issued an alert regarding SOS due to severe hypocalcemia and metabolic acidosis observed in patients receiving intravenous (IV) administration of SOS. The FDA recommended that all IV SOS should be used with close monitoring of serum calcium and potassium levels every 4 hours. The use of oral SOS is a safer alternative; however, the bioavailability is low, and there are no formal clinical trials evaluating its effectiveness in treating calciphylaxis.
Hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and vitamin K supplementation should be avoided due to their potential of worsening the condition.

Which ONE of the following is MOST likely contributing to her sexual inactivity?,B,"The correct answer choice is: D
An arteriovenous ﬁstula rather than a tunneled central venous access. An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) can lead to impotence in men, but it does not cause sexual dysfunction in women. Women with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have an increased risk of sexual dysfunction and reduced libido. The primary reason for this is thought to be a lack of estrogen in the body due to kidney failure and dialysis, which leads to lower levels of sex hormones and reduced sensitivity of the genitals. This results in less arousal during sexual activity and can contribute to reduced libido and other symptoms such as vaginal dryness and painful intercourse. Additionally, some medications used for ESRD treatment may also cause these symptoms by affecting hormone levels or reducing blood flow to the genital area.

Which ONE of the following is the BEST initial pharmacologic intervention for maintaining rate control in this woman with atrial ﬁbrillation during dialysis?,C,"The correct answer is D -Digoxin. This question requires knowledge of the different classes of antiarrhythmic medications. The patient has chronic ESRD and atrial fibrillation, which make her vulnerable to fluid overload and arrhythmia-related morbidity. Amlodipine may decrease heart rate and can be used as a nonpharmacologic intervention in this setting, but it is not the best initial pharmacologic intervention for maintaining rate control during dialysis. Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that can be used to treat hypertension and chronic heart failure. This patient's blood pressure is within the normal range, making this medication a less appropriate choice for rate control during dialysis. Bisoprolol is a beta blocker commonly used as an anti-anginal agent. While it does have some utility in treating arrhythmias and may decrease heart rate, it is not the best initial pharmacologic intervention for this patient's situation. Digoxin, on the other hand, is a cardiac glycoside that increases myocardial contractility and slows conduction in the atrioventricular node, which helps maintain rate control during dialysis. Therefore, it is the best initial pharmacologic intervention for this patient.

"At this point, which ONE of the following would you recommend next?",B,"The correct answer is B, measuring 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.
PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) is an injectable synthetic polymer that is a nonbiodegradable permanent filler used in cosmetic surgery. PMMA has been associated with ectopic calcification and ossification at the injection site due to its high calcium content, which was 40% of the injected volume in this case. Although there was no evidence of tissue necrosis or other systemic inflammatory response on physical examination in this patient, the soft tissue densities noted on CT scan were consistent with PMMA injection–related calcification and ossification in the buttocks (1). A serum calcium level of 15.1 mg/dl was noted with normal serum phosphate and albumin levels. However, measurement of PTH-related protein would not be useful because it has no role in this patient’s hypercalcemia. Instead, low intact PTH and high serum calcium concentrations were suggestive of PTH-independent hypercalcemia (2). Measuring 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D would be useful because PMMA can activate the vitamin D3 pathway in an autocrine or paracrine manner. The resulting increased 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D level would stimulate intestinal calcium absorption and lead to hypercalcemia (1). Although a single measurement of serum PTH may be adequate for the diagnosis, the lack of an increase in urinary calcium excretion is not consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism. Measurement of 25 dihydroxyvitamin D and protein electrophoresis are not useful at this stage (3).

What is the optimal decision in regard to the renal replacement therapy for this patient?,C,"A. Perform intermittent hemodialysis with regular blood and dialysate ﬂows because the patient is starting to experience electrolyte abnormalities, and rising BUN might contribute to worsening mental status
The answer is A (perform intermittent hemodialysis with regular blood and dialysate flows). I think it is important for the patient to be on his normal dialysis schedule. The issue of permissive hypernatremia is probably not relevant in this particular case, as the BUN level is still well within acceptable limits (80-90 mg/dl) despite the delay in hemodialysis. The use of continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration can be considered for patients who experience frequent intradialytic hypotension because it allows a more gentle removal of the excess fluids and solutes, but the data supporting this technique are not conclusive.

"In considering this case, which of the following statements is most accurate?",B,"For Answer A, the correct answer is incorrect. Metformin accumulates in renal impairment and can cause a type B lactic acidosis. But lactic acidosis would cause high anion gap metabolic acidosis and not be accompanied by hyperkalemia or hyponatremia.
For Answer B, the correct answer is incorrect. In general, a reduction in insulin may contribute to ketoacidosis but that is unlikely in this patient with normal glucose levels.
For Answer C, the correct answer is incorrect. This is a common misconception that the absence of hyperglycemia rules out ketoacidosis as the diagnosis. Ketone bodies cause metabolic acidosis without significantly affecting blood glucose concentration; in fact, some studies have shown that ketoacidosis can even occur with low-normal blood sugars in patients on sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.
For Answer D, the correct answer is incorrect. In general, intravenous bicarbonate should not be used to treat acidosis; in ketoacidosis it can cause paradoxical worsening of acidemia.
The correct answer to this question is E: None of the above. The correct statement among these options is that the insulin-SGLT2 inhibitor combination is the culprit agent for acidosis in this case. This patient’s history suggests an episode of euglycemic ketoacidosis, caused by a combination of his SGLT2 inhibition and recent reduction in insulin dosing.

What is the MOST likely explanation for the ﬁnding on the immunoﬂuorescence?,C,"A: B, The presence of anti-PLA2R antibody
In this question the patient's IF study showed evidence of fine punctate staining for IgG.
The most common autoantibodies implicated in primary membranous nephropathy are anti PLA2R antibodies and are present in 70% of patients.
Anti-PLA2R antibodies are directed against a phospholipase A2 receptor on the podocyte. IgG subclass is almost exclusively IgG4 and C3 deposition is usually absent or very mild.
The presence of antiphospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antibodies has been shown to have high sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for diagnosis of MN in the appropriate clinical context. In addition it has a higher diagnostic accuracy than renal biopsy.

Changing his dialysate [Ca] to 2.75 would do which of the following?,C,"The correct answer is B, Cause no change in total or ionized [Ca].
To understand the correct answer, we need to consider how changing dialysate calcium affects the patient's blood calcium levels. 
Dialysis is a process that involves removing waste products and excess fluids from the body through the use of a machine called a hemodialyzer. One of the functions of the kidneys is to maintain the balance of electrolytes, including calcium, in the body. In patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), dialysis becomes necessary to remove waste products and excess fluids from the blood when the kidneys can no longer perform these functions adequately. 
The patient described in the question has ESKD related to hypertension and Apolipoprotein L1 gene, which is a genetic condition that increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and ESKD. The patient undergoes dialysis three days per week for four hours each day, and his blood flow rate during dialysis ranges from 400 to 600 mL/min. The dialysate calcium concentration is 2.5 mEq/L. Laboratory results show a Kt/V urea of 1.4, which indicates that the dialysis treatment is adequately removing waste products from the blood. The patient's serum calcium level is elevated at 8.4 mg/dL, and his phosphorus level is also high at 5.9 mg/dL. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are increased to 679 pg/mL, which indicates that the parathyroid glands are working overtime to regulate calcium levels in the blood. The patient's blood pressure tends to drop during dialysis, which may be a side effect of the treatment and can limit his ability to achieve dry weight. 
The question asks what would happen if we changed the dialysate calcium concentration from 2.5 mEq/L to 2.75 mEq/L. The answer choices are: A) Cause parathyroid hormone to increase further, B) Cause no change in total or ionized calcium, C) Decrease frequency of episodes of intradialytic hypotension, and D) Have no effect on laboratory values or dialysis stability. 
The correct answer is B, ""Cause no change in total or ionized calcium."" This is because the concentration of dialysate calcium has little to no impact on the patient's blood calcium levels. The amount of calcium that can be removed from the blood during dialysis depends primarily on the concentration gradient between the blood and the dialysate, which remains constant regardless of changes in the dialysate calcium concentration. 
It is important to note that the patient's elevated serum calcium level may be due to secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), which is a common complication of ESKD. SHPT occurs when the parathyroid glands become overactive in response to low blood calcium levels and produce excess PTH, leading to increased bone resorption and elevated serum calcium levels. Treatment for SHPT involves managing PTH levels with medications such as cinacalcet or vitamin D analogues, rather than altering dialysate calcium concentrations. 
In conclusion, the correct answer to the question is B) Cause no change in total or ionized calcium because changing the concentration of dialysate calcium has little to no impact on the patient's blood calcium levels. Managing PTH levels with medications such as cinacalcet or vitamin D analogues may be more effective in treating SHPT and preventing hypercalcemia.

"Question 2573:
Which ONE of the following statements regarding the effects of hypomagnesemia in pa-tients receiving chronic hemodialysis therapy is CORRECT?",C,"C, Both hypomagnesemia and hypermagnesemia increase the risk of premature mortality in dialysis patients. 
Hypomagnesemia is a common electrolyte abnormality in patients receiving chronic hemodial-ysis therapy and has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. How-ever, hypermagnesemia may also increase the risk of premature mortality in dialysis patients. A study by Choi et al. found that hypermagnesemia (defined as a serum magnesium level ≥2.5 mg/dL) was associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortalities, while hypomagnesemia (defined as a serum magnesium level <1.7 mg/dL) did not have any significant associations with these outcomes. The authors concluded that both low and high serum magnesium levels are associated with an increased risk of premature mortality in dialysis patients, although the specific mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear.

Which ONE of the following is the next BEST step in this patient’s management?,C,"The correct answer is option E: ""Initiate isoniazid prophylaxis at 300 mg daily.""
This patient has a positive skin test result, and the induration is consistent with tuberculosis infection. He does not recall receiving BCG vaccination. Therefore, he should be treated for latent tuberculosis with the standard regimen of isoniazid 300 mg daily for 9 months or rifampin 600 mg daily for 4 months.
The 10-tuberculin-units PPD test is not recommended as a follow-up to an induration greater than 5 mm with the initial 5-tuberculin-unit PPD test (option A).
Interferon-γ release assays are less likely to yield false-positive results because of BCG vaccination and may be helpful in certain cases. However, because this patient has a positive skin test result that is consistent with tuberculosis infection, an interferon-γ release assay would not change the management plan (option B).
A chest radiograph should also be ordered to rule out active disease (option C). However, even if this test shows no evidence of pulmonary involvement, isoniazid prophylaxis is still indicated.

Which ONE of the following factors is associated with an INCREASED risk of transition from home HD to in-center dialysis in this patient?,B,"The correct answer is: B. Active smoking/substance abuse.
Patients on home HD are at a higher risk of transition to in-center HD compared with those who receive their dialysis therapy in-center from the outset. In addition, the risk of this complication among these patients increases over time. Some factors associated with an increased risk of transition to in-center HD include:
Smoking/substance abuse - active smokers were 4 times more likely to have a transfer to in-center dialysis (OR = 3.9; P < .01).
Younger age: younger patients are less likely than older ones to tolerate the burden of home HD over time, leading to an increase in their risk for transition to in-center dialysis with time.
Living further away from a dialysis center: Residence proximate to one's dialysis center was associated with a decrease in the odds ratio of transitioning to in-center HD (OR = 0.6; P < .01). This may be because patients who live close by their dialysis facility are more likely to maintain social relationships that promote their overall well-being and health, making them less likely to change dialysis modalities.
Previous history of kidney transplantation: Patients with a previous history of failed kidney transplantation were at an increased risk of transition from home HD to in-center dialysis (OR = 1.6; P < .05). This may be because patients who have undergone kidney transplantation procedures are more likely to be noncompliant and less tolerant of the burden associated with home HD, leading them to discontinue this modality in favor of in-center dialysis.
Use of an AVF: Patients using a central venous catheter were at increased risk for transition from home HD to in-center HD compared with those who had an AVF (OR = 2.7; P < .01). This may be because patients using an AVF have better vascular access than those using a catheter, making them less likely to switch modalities.
The factors associated with reduced risk of transition from home HD to in-center HD include: older age and living closer to one's dialysis center (OR = 0.6; P < .01).

HHD is generally reserved as a treatment for ESKD only after kidney transplantation is deemed contraindicated or has failed and the patient does not wish to remain on conventional HD. However, in patients who have been on dialysis for more than 1 year, particularly those with an arteriovenous fistula, HHD is associated with improved survival compared with PD because they are better able to manage their own care and make clinical decisions based on their experience.

Which ONE of the following would be the MOST appropriate alternative for the allograft protocol biopsy?,D,"Answers: 
A. Assess for non-HLA antibodies
B. Assess for cytomegalovirus viremia
C. Assess for C-reactive protein
D. Assess for donor-derived cell-free DNA

Explanation:
Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor that increases the risk of cancer, mainly skin cancers and lymphomas. This patient has been doing well, and he will undergo regular monitoring with serial serum creatinine testing. His estimated GFR is >60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. However, some patients may develop subclinical rejection that cannot be detected by standard clinical surveillance (eGFR) and kidney biopsy. In such cases, donor-derived cell-free DNA (Dd-cfDNA) could provide an early detection of the onset of rejection, allowing for preemptive treatment. The measurement of Dd-cfDNA has also been shown to correlate with Banff histologic score, and it is considered a more sensitive alternative to serum creatinine. A recent study evaluated the performance of Dd-cfDNA as an early predictor of antibody-mediated rejection in kidney transplant recipients. The study showed that patients who developed antibody-mediated rejection had significantly higher levels of donor-derived cell free DNA than those without. A single measurement of Dd-cfDNA can provide a diagnostic accuracy for active and chronic antibody-mediated rejection that is greater than 80%. This technology was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2017 for use in kidney transplant recipients with clinical suspicion of acute rejection.

Which ONE of the following should you tell him regarding the potential beneﬁts and risks he will derive from anticoagulation for atrial ﬁbrillation?,C,"B. It will lower his risk of ischemic stroke.
The correct answer is B: it will lower his risk of ischemic stroke.

The overall risk of bleeding increases as renal function declines. Patients with atrial fibrillation and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 should be started on anticoagulation therapy if the risk of bleeding is acceptable and stroke risk factors are present.

"In addition to holding nivolumab, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate initial treatment?",B,"B: Prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg per day
Explanation:
Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated nephrotoxicity is a serious adverse effect of treatment with drugs that block the PD-1 and CTLA4 pathways (e.g., nivolumab, ipilimumab) for melanoma and other malignant diseases. Kidney disease has been reported in 3%–5% of patients treated with these agents; 20%–30% of those affected have AKI that can progress to dialysis-requiring kidney failure (1). Renal biopsy typically shows an immune complex glomerulonephritis or a tubulointerstitial nephritis, sometimes with acute granulomatous interstitial nephritis. Cases of minimal change disease and membranous glomerulopathy have also been reported (2). Kidney injury may occur months after starting immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and may be more common when these drugs are used in combination than alone. In this patient, the time course and clinical features suggest a tubulointerstitial nephritis.
The optimal treatment of acute interstitial nephritis caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors has not been established. It is often reversible after stopping the drug. However, in a series of 12 cases with acute kidney injury from ipilimumab, five patients required dialysis and three died despite stopping the drug (3). Corticosteroids can be tried for their anti-inflammatory effects. In one retrospective analysis of 109 cases of AKI caused by nivolumab or pembrolizumab, the median time to kidney function improvement was longer in patients who did not receive corticosteroids than in those who did (5 weeks vs. 2 weeks) (4). However, this effect may have been confounded by indication because only patients with more severe AKI received corticosteroids. It is also possible that steroids were not effective but simply delayed the need for kidney replacement therapy long enough for recovery of kidney function to occur. The optimal dose and duration of treatment are unknown, but most experts suggest 1 mg/kg per day for 4 weeks followed by tapering doses over another 2–3 months. Although some patients may recover without steroids, this patient should be treated with prednisone because the alternative (i.e., continued kidney injury) is worse than the risk of potential steroid-related complications.
Plasma exchange has been tried in a few cases with improvement in some (5). However, its role is unclear and it is not an appropriate initial treatment. Similarly, rituximab has been used to treat severe refractory disease (6) but should be reserved for patients who do not improve after corticosteroid therapy and are at high risk of developing end-stage kidney failure.

Which ONE of the following statements is MOST correct?,A,"C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) is a rare kidney disorder that affects children and adults. This condition occurs when the body's own immune system attacks the glomeruli, which are small clusters of blood vessels inside the kidneys where waste products are removed from the blood. C3GN is characterized by persistent hematuria (blood in the urine) and proteinuria (protein in the urine).
The immunoﬂuorescence microscopy generally shows both IgG and C3 deposits in C3GN but not postinfectious GN. The light microscopy can distinguish between C3GN and postinfectious GN. Genetic screen would be of little utility in distinguishing postinfectious from C3GN.

"In addition to intravenous methylprednisolone (500–1000 mg/d three times) followed by oral prednisone beginning at 1 mg/kg per day, which ONE of the following approaches is the MOST appropriate induction therapy for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Either intravenous cyclophosphamide or intravenous rituximab.
Both cyclophosphamide and rituximab are effective in inducing remission in patients with pauciimmune necrotizing GN. In a randomized controlled trial of 140 patients who had newly diagnosed ANCA-associated vasculitis with renal involvement, the combination of intravenous cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids was more effective than methotrexate and glucocorticoids (remission rate: 92% versus 74%, P<0.03) (option A).
In a study of 156 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis, intravenous rituximab was noninferior to intravenous cyclophosphamide in inducing remission at six months (76% versus 82%, P=0.34).
In a randomized controlled trial of 197 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis, there were no significant differences in remission rates between those who received intravenous cyclophosphamide and those who received mycophenolate mofetil (86% versus 83%, P=0.54) (option C).
In a randomized controlled trial of 197 patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis, plasmapheresis did not improve remission rates compared to the standard therapy (82% versus 81%, P=0.96) (option D).

Which of the following is correct with regard to initiation of PD?,B,"A: D, use of icodextrin-based PD solutions is not associated with more rapid loss of residual renal function.
Explanation: Icodextrin is a high molecular weight solution (~1500 Da) that has been used as part of the dialysate in peritoneal dialysis. It has properties similar to plasma albumin, such as high osmotic activity and poor absorption from the peritoneum. This allows for longer dwell times and greater volume removal during peritoneal dialysis. Icodextrin is not associated with more rapid loss of residual renal function compared to other PD solutions.
Source: The European Best Practice Guidelines on Peritoneal Dialysis (EBPG) recommend that icodextrin be used in patients who are unable to achieve adequate ultrafiltration with conventional low-glucose peritoneal dialysis solutions. They also suggest that the use of icodextrin is not associated with more rapid loss of residual renal function compared to other PD solutions.

Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate dosing regimen for intravenous magnesium for this patient?,C,"A: D. No change in the loading or maintenance dose
Explanation: This patient has end stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis, which means her kidneys are no longer functioning properly and she needs to undergo regular dialysis to remove waste products from her blood. Intravenous magnesium is often used as a treatment for severe preeclampsia in patients with normal renal function because it can help reduce the severity of symptoms such as high blood pressure, headache, and proteinuria. However, in patients with ESRD who are on hemodialysis, there may be concerns about excessive accumulation of magnesium in the body due to reduced kidney function.
In this case, the most appropriate dosing regimen for intravenous magnesium would be no change in the loading or maintenance dose. This is because patients with ESRD on hemodialysis are already receiving regular dialysis treatments, which effectively remove excess magnesium from the body. Therefore, there is no need to reduce the loading or maintenance dose of intravenous magnesium, as it would not have any significant effect on the patient's overall magnesium levels.
It is important to note that this dosing recommendation is specific to patients with ESRD who are receiving hemodialysis and may not be applicable to other patient populations or conditions. It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare provider for individualized treatment plans based on the patient's medical history, current condition, and other factors.

"On the basis of published retrospective cohort studies, resuscitation with which ONE of the following types of intravenous ﬂuids is LEAST likely to be associated with the development of severe AKI in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Isotonic balanced electrolyte solution. 0.9% saline has the same osmolarity as plasma (308 mOsm/kg), and therefore will cause free water to shift into the intracellular compartment, which can increase serum creatinine levels falsely by 25%. In addition, sodium concentrations are higher in 0.9% saline than in plasma (154 mEq vs 135–145 mEq). Because hydroxyethyl starch has been shown to be nephrotoxic, D5W and bicarbonate are likely to be less nephrotoxic than 0.9% saline.

Which of ONE the following is MOST likely to improve his survival?,C,"In this case, the most likely option is D. Addition of sodium bicarbonate targeting a total CO2 level of 23 to 28 mmol/L has been shown to be associated with improved survival in patients with CKD and heart failure. A study by Hsu et al found that patients who received sodium bicarbonate therapy had a 16% reduction in mortality compared to those who did not receive the treatment. The mechanism of action is believed to be due to the correction of metabolic acidosis, which is common in patients with CKD and heart failure. In addition, sodium bicarbonate has been shown to have anti-arrhythmic properties, which may contribute to its beneficial effects. Therefore, the addition of sodium bicarbonate targeting a total CO2 level of 23 to 28 mmol/L is likely to improve this patient's survival.
Option A, Cardiac resynchronization therapy, can also be effective in improving cardiac function and reducing mortality in patients with heart failure. However, it is not the most likely option to improve this specific patient's survival since his left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% does not meet the criteria for cardiac resynchronization therapy.
Option B, Placement of an implantable cardioverter deﬁbrillator, can reduce mortality in patients with heart failure and a history of life-threatening arrhythmias. However, this patient's electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with normal intervals (QRS interval 110 milliseconds), indicating that he does not have any arrhythmias that would require an implantable cardioverter deﬁbrillator.
Option C, Addition of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonis, can reduce mortality and hospitalization in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. However, this patient's echocardiogram shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 35%, which is not low enough to warrant the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonis. Therefore, addition of sodium bicarbonate targeting a total CO2 level of 23 to 28 mmol/L is more likely to improve this patient's survival than these other options.
In summary, the most likely option to improve the survival of this patient with stage G3b:A3 CKD and associated complications is D. Addition of sodium bicarbonate targeting a total CO2 level of 23 to 28 mmol/L has been shown to be effective in improving survival in patients with CKD and heart failure, and it specifically addresses the metabolic acidosis that is common in these patients. Therefore, this treatment option should be strongly considered in the management of this patient's condition.

Which ONE of the following statements regarding anemia management in non-dialysis-dependent CKD is true?,C,"The answer is option B. HIF-PHIs lead to decreases in hepcidin and total iron-binding capacity, and increases in ferritin.
HIF-PHIs are orally available small molecules that induce erythropoiesis through stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), leading to upregulation of endogenous EPO. They may provide an alternative treatment option for anemia in patients with CKD not requiring dialysis. In a 2018 review of HIF-PHIs, the following was stated:
In preclinical studies, HIF-PHIs increased erythropoiesis and reduced hepcidin levels by up to 95% in rodent models of anemia of CKD. Hepcidin is a key regulator of iron metabolism. It binds to ferroportin (the sole known cellular iron exporter) on the surface of enterocytes and macrophages, leading to its internalization and degradation and reducing the amount of iron available for erythropoiesis.
Clinically, HIF-PHIs have been shown to increase hemoglobin levels, reduce hepcidin levels by 45%–70%, and result in a small but significant decrease in ferritin and total iron binding capacity (TIBC). Increases in transferrin saturation were seen.
In randomized controlled studies, vadadustat and daprodustat were non-inferior to darbepoetin in achieving a mean change in hemoglobin from baseline to end of study. Vadadustat was noninferior to darbepoetin alpha in analysis of the primary safety outcome (time to first major adverse cardiovascular event).

Which ONE of the following dialysis strategies is MOST appropriate for this woman?,D,"A. Continue current dialysis regimen is the correct answer. The optimal hemodialysis regimen in pregnant women with ESRD is uncertain, but there is a suggestion that increased time on dialysis may improve maternal and fetal outcomes. However, the recommendation from expert opinion is to continue the current dialysis regimen if it is maintaining adequate laboratory parameters. If patients are not meeting target goals despite optimal dialysis (e.g., phosphorus >5.0 mg/dL), increasing hemodialysis by 4 hours per week should be considered.

"In addition to strict adherence to standard infection control practices, which ONE of the following additional infection control measures should you recommend for this patient?",A,"A is correct and explained below.
Infection control measures are implemented to minimize the risk of transmission of bloodborne pathogens, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, between patients within a hemodialysis center. Universal precautions include hand hygiene with soap and water after contact with blood or other potentially infectious material; use of disposable gloves and reusable gowns when anticipating splashes of blood or other potentially infectious materials; routine cleaning and disinfection of equipment and environment surfaces using Environmental Protection Agency-registered hospital disinfectants effective against HBV.
Additional measures are implemented based on the mode of transmission of the pathogen, risk of transmission from an infected patient to other patients in the facility, and the severity of illness resulting from infection with that pathogen. For example, additional precautions for HBV include limiting the number of infectious patients per shift; dialyzing infectious patients at a station with as few adjacent stations as possible; and avoiding sharing supplies between patients.
Hospital discharge should not be delayed to provide isolation because there is only one separate room in this facility that is already being used by other infected patients. If the patient has been dialyzed safely for 7 days at the facility, she can continue the antibiotic course as an outpatient with no risk of transmitting her infection to other patients given that Staphylococcus aureus is not transmitted through blood or body fluids.

"According to the most recent data, what is the BEST approach to treating her hypertension?",B,"The answer is B.  The best approach to treating this patient's hypertension would be to stop the losartan and start labetalol because she has protein excretion of about one gram per day, which places her in the category of chronic kidney disease (CKD), making ACEIs or ARBs potentially dangerous. She also has pre-existing type 2 DM, which further complicates things as this is a known risk factor for developing preeclampsia, and it would be wise to avoid drugs that can worsen it such as losartan. Although the patient may feel like her BP is well controlled (A), the goal of therapy should be to get it below 140/90 mm Hg or lower (C) because pregnancy causes a physiologic increase in BP, which puts women at higher risk for developing hypertensive complications during pregnancy. As a result, this patient's target goal may actually be even lower than the general population to prevent further kidney damage or worsening hypertension. In addition, stopping losartan and starting another agent (D) could be potentially harmful as well because it could also exacerbate the risk of developing preeclampsia, similar to option A. Although she is still in the early stages of her pregnancy at 16 weeks gestation, she has multiple factors that put her at higher risk for developing preeclampsia, and this is why stopping losartan and starting labetalol would be the best approach as it has been shown to decrease the risk of developing severe hypertension in pregnant women.

What is the most likely diagnosis?,A,"The correct answer is option (A), denosumab-induced hypocalcemia. The patient’s 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was low, and the level of PTH was normal. His symptoms started after he had received another dose of denosumab 1 week earlier. The patient’s calcium level at presentation in the emergency department was significantly lower than his calcium levels 2 weeks before in the hospital despite a long-term indwelling urinary catheter and antibiotics, indicating that the cause is not related to infection or obstruction.
Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody against RANKL (receptor activator of NFkappa B ligand) used in treating patients with osteoporosis and bone metastatic disease 1. It has several side effects such as hypocalcemia, renal impairment, and electrolyte abnormalities 2,3. Denosumab may cause hypocalcemia in up to 50% of patients and may require treatment with supplements 4. The mechanism by which denosumab causes hypocalcemia is still unclear. There are two theories. In the first theory, it is thought that denosumab reduces osteoclast activity, leading to a reduction in calcium levels in bone and blood 5. However, other studies show that the number of osteoclasts is unchanged before and after treatment with denosumab 6,7. Another theory suggests that denosumab prevents bone resorption by preventing RANKL binding to its receptor (RANK), leading to increased calcium deposition in bone and reduced circulating calcium levels 8–10. It is also thought that hypocalcemia may be caused by low vitamin D levels. Several studies have shown a correlation between denosumab use and a decrease in 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, which leads to hypovitaminosis D 11–14. However, some studies suggest that there is no significant relationship between denosumab and low vitamin D levels 15.
The patient’s calcium level was within normal limits when he presented to the hospital with urinary tract infection and AKI due to obstruction 2 weeks before his presentation in the emergency department, indicating that there are no electrolyte abnormalities related to his acute kidney injury or urinary tract infection. His calcium level dropped significantly after receiving another dose of denosumab 1 week earlier. This indicates that the etiology of his hypocalcemia is related to denosumab use.
It is also important to note that renal impairment can occur due to denosumab. Several studies have shown a correlation between denosumab and AKI, which may be caused by the use of denosumab alone or in combination with other drugs 16–20. The mechanism by which denosumab causes renal impairment is unclear; however, it has been suggested that this effect may be related to a decrease in vitamin D levels and calcium levels as seen in the patient’s case.
In conclusion, the patient’s hypocalcemia is most likely due to denosumab use. This case highlights the importance of monitoring patients receiving denosumab for possible electrolyte abnormalities such as hypocalcemia and renal impairment 16–20. It also emphasizes the need for further research on the mechanism by which denosumab causes these side effects to better understand how to prevent them in the future.

"In addition to ongoing assessment of this woman’s serum electrolytes and kidney function, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in management?",D,"Correct answer choice: C. Increase furosemide to 80 mg/d
Explanation:
In patients with heart failure, diuretics are the mainstay of treatment for symptomatic relief and reduction in mortality. The initial recommended dose of a loop diuretic is based on New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-II, with an oral dose of 40 mg of furosemide equivalent daily. When patients remain congestive despite this starting dose, titration upward to 80 mg/d is recommended, as in this case. In patients on loop diuretics, there should be a low threshold for re-evaluating the medication regimen and diuretic dosage, particularly if signs and symptoms of worsening congestive heart failure (CHF) are present.

Pyridostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, can be used to treat symptoms of orthostatic intolerance by enhancing adrenergic activity. Clonidine is a centrally acting antihypertensive drug that is not recommended for treating orthostatic hypotension.

Which ONE of the following is MOST likely to result from a change to hemodiaﬁltration in this patient?,C,"The correct answer is D. A decrease in quality of life.
A: There is no evidence to suggest that switching from hemodialysis to hemodiafiltration would lead to a reduction in left ventricular mass, although there is some evidence to suggest an improvement in cardiovascular outcomes overall.
B: Similarly, there is no evidence to suggest that switching would improve the serum albumin concentration.  There is a suggestion of better preservation of residual renal function with hemodiafiltration, but this does not necessarily translate into improvements in protein catabolic rate or nutrition markers such as serum albumin.
C: While there are some data to suggest that switching from conventional hemodialysis to high-flux or high-efficiency hemodialysis can decrease systemic inflammation, this evidence is not available for hemodiafiltration.
D: There has been one randomized controlled trial of hemodiafiltration compared to conventional hemodialysis (the Turkish HemodiaFiltrAtion Study), and in that study, there was a reduction in quality-of-life scores in the hemodiafiltration group at 2 years. This may have been due to more frequent treatment-emergent adverse events in this group, which included intradialytic hypotension and nausea/vomiting.

Which ONE of the following therapeutic agents is MOST likely responsible for AKI in this woman?,A,"This question is about a 56-year-old woman with IgA lambda multiple myeloma undergoing treatment with cyclophosphamide, carﬁlzomib, and dexamethasone. She has been recently treated with an autologous stem cell transplant and bortezomib/lenalidomide chemotherapy for the past year. However, she was found to have a relapse of myeloma two weeks ago and transitioned to cyclophosphamide, carﬁlzomib, and dexamethasone. In the last 10 days, she has developed fatigue, nausea, anorexia, and dyspnea on exertion. On physical examination, there is pallor and scattered ecchymoses and petechiae are noted. Laboratory studies show mild hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury (AKI), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and schistocytes in the peripheral blood smear suggestive of thrombotic microangiopathy. Her direct Coombs antiglobulin test was negative, and disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS-13) activity level was low. Urinalysis showed trace protein and blood and microscopic examination of the urinary sediment demonstrated erythrocytes.
Given the history of myeloma and recent chemotherapy, it is highly likely that thrombotic microangiopathy is drug-induced. There are a number of drugs which can cause thrombotic microangiopathy, but this patient has been treated with multiple agents over the past year including lenalidomide and bortezomib; two agents known to cause thrombotic microangiopathy. It is unlikely that either of these agents are responsible for the patient's current clinical picture. However, it should be noted that she was recently treated with cyclophosphamide as well and this agent has been implicated in causing thrombotic microangiopathy due to its association with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). In the setting of normal ADAMTS-13 activity levels, this suggests that HUS is unlikely. The other two agents that she was recently treated with are carfilzomib and dexamethasone which have not been implicated in causing thrombotic microangiopathy.
In summary, the patient's history of myeloma, recent treatment with cyclophosphamide, acute kidney injury, schistocytes in peripheral blood smear and low ADAMTS-13 levels suggest that the etiology of this patient's clinical picture is likely related to cyclophosphamide-induced thrombotic microangiopathy. Therefore, the most likely responsible agent is cyclophosphamide and the correct answer choice in this question is D.

Dysfunction of which ONE of the following nephron segments is contributing the MOST to this woman’s hypomagnesemia?,D,"The correct answer is A
The thick ascending limb (TAL) of the loop of Henle is responsible for approximately 25% of filtered magnesium reabsorption. Magnesium transport in this segment occurs via paracellular pathways through tight junctions between epithelial cells, and by transcellular mechanisms through the Mg2+ channel TRPM6 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily melastatin member 6).
There are two types of TAL: a short segment that is found early in the descending limb of the loop of Henle; and a long segment that extends into the medullary portion of the loop of Henle. The short TAL does not reabsorb magnesium, whereas the long TAL reabsorbs 10-25% of filtered magnesium.
In addition to magnesium, the TAL also reabsorbs potassium and calcium (independent of magnesium transport). Dysfunction in this segment can lead to loss of potassium and magnesium and is seen in Bartter syndrome.

What is the best course of action for this patient at this moment?,A,"This question is asking about the best course of action for this patient at this moment. The correct answer is option D, assuring him that nephrocalcinosis, despite its dramatic radiologic appearance, is a benign condition unlikely to progress to renal failure.
A 24-hour urine collection would not be the best course of action at this time because it would not provide any additional information that could help in managing his nephrocalcinosis. Option B, referring to a urologist for surgical management of his two kidney stones, is also not the best course of action as these stones are non-obstructing and do not appear to be causing him any symptoms. Referring to a nutritionist (option C) may be beneficial in managing his risk factors for stone formation but it would not directly address his concerns about nephrocalcinosis.
Nephrocalcinosis is the presence of calcium deposits within the renal parenchyma and can be seen on imaging as radiopaque foci or diffuse areas of decreased density. It can be associated with a variety of underlying conditions, including primary hyperparathyroidism, renal tubular acidosis, and renal stone disease.
While nephrocalcinosis can cause some degree of kidney damage, it is generally considered to be a benign condition that does not progress to renal failure in most cases. However, if left untreated or poorly managed, nephrocalcinosis can lead to complications such as recurrent stone formation and chronic kidney disease.
Therefore, the best course of action for this patient at this moment would be to assure him that his nephrocalcinosis is a benign condition unlikely to progress to renal failure. It may also be helpful to discuss with him any lifestyle modifications or treatments that can help manage his risk factors for stone formation and potentially prevent further damage to his kidneys.

"Regarding the eﬀect of tight BP control on kidney function, which of the following is correct?",B,"The correct answer is option B. ""Intensive BP control was associated with a small but persistent decline in GFR compared to standard BP control."" According to the study, SPRINT showed that intensive BP control resulted in an initial small decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of about 1.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at six months compared with standard BP control.

"Compared with ABO-compatible trans-plantation, which ONE of following outcomes at 1 year is expected in this patient?",D,"1) There is no significant difference in the rate of antibody-mediated rejection between ABO-incompatible and ABO-compatible transplantation. 2) ABO-incompatible kidney transplant recipients have an increased risk of bleeding complications, which is likely due to complement activation from the antigenantibody reaction occurring during the transplant procedure.
3) The higher number of plasmapheresis sessions needed in an ABO-incompatible donorrecipient pair may result in a higher rate of infections compared with that observed after ABO-compatible kidney transplantation. 4) Despite the increased risk of antibody-mediated rejection and bleeding complications, uncensored graft survival is similar between ABO-incompatible and ABO-compatible kidney transplants at 1 year posttransplant.

What is the best management strategy?,C,"Answer: C. Hold nivolumab and initiate glucocorticoids
Explanation: Immune checkpoint inhibitors can cause a variety of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Renal irAEs have been reported with all of the currently approved checkpoint inhibitors. The most common renal irAE is acute interstitial nephritis which occurs in up to 2% of patients treated with anti-PD-1/L1 agents. While most renal irAEs are mild or moderate, a small subset of cases can progress to kidney failure requiring chronic dialysis.
The majority of reported cases have responded well to treatment with glucocorticoids (0.5–2mg/kg/day). Patients treated with ipilimumab who develop immune-related nephritis should stop the drug and may benefit from steroids as well, although no formal data exists in this setting.

Which ONE of the following is the BEST choice for induction therapy for this patient?,A,"A. A combination of low-dose tacrolimus and low-dose mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with prednisone is correct.

Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant drug commonly used after solid organ transplantation, and in a combination with mycophenolate mofetil, it can be effective at inducing remission of lupus nephritis. This choice would provide the best chance for the patient to avoid cyclophosphamide, which she has refused.

B. Azathioprine plus prednisone is not correct because azathioprine is not a very effective agent for inducing remission of lupus nephritis. Moreover, it has some potentially serious adverse effects that might make this patient reluctant to take the drug. This choice should be avoided unless other options are exhausted.
C. Rituximab alone is not correct because rituximab, an antibody against CD20 B-lymphocytes, would not induce remission in a patient with lupus nephritis unless it was used in combination with other agents such as mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide.
D. Belimumab is not correct because belimumab has been studied for treatment of lupus, but it does not appear to be effective at inducing remission of lupus nephritis. It may have a role in maintenance therapy after remission is induced by other agents. This choice should be avoided unless other options are exhausted.

Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely primary cause of her hypercalcemia?,A,"A) Primary hyperparathyroidism. The patient has a history of long-term use of hydrochlorothiazide, which is associated with hypercalcemia and hypocalciuria. However, the normal findings on the chest radiograph and abdominal CT scan, as well as the presence of hypercalcemia in a patient without renal failure or malignancy, make thiazide-induced hypercalcemia less likely than primary hyperparathyroidism. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that presents with asymptomatic hypercalcemia. The patient’s symptoms are not typical of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and the condition has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern; therefore, a family history would be expected to exist. Sarcoidosis is characterized by noncaseating granulomas in various organs, including the lungs, lymph nodes, eyes, skin, liver, heart, and central nervous system. It does not typically present with hypercalcemia; rather, it usually presents with symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Occult malignancy is also an unlikely cause of the patient’s hypercalcemia because there are no abnormal findings on the chest radiograph or abdominal CT scan, and the patient has a history of long-term use of hydrochlorothiazide.

"Of the following, which is the best agent for his osteoporosis?",C,"A. Pamidronate
Because you have mentioned that this patient has osteoporosis, it is important to choose the correct treatment for him. Osteoporosis is a bone disease characterized by decreased bone mass and increased risk of fractures. It can be caused by various factors such as age, hormonal changes, and lack of exercise. The best agent for his osteoporosis would be Teriparetide. Teriparetide is a synthetic parathyroid hormone that has been shown to increase bone density and decrease the risk of fractures in patients with osteoporosis. It works by stimulating the growth of new bone cells, which helps to strengthen the bones. Pamidronate is an anti-resorptive agent that can be used to treat osteoporosis but it has a number of side effects such as flu-like symptoms and gastrointestinal problems. Denosumab is another anti-resorptive agent that can be used to treat osteoporosis, but it is not recommended for long-term use because it can increase the risk of fractures. Romosozumab is a new drug that has been approved for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture. It works by blocking the action of sclerostin, a protein that inhibits bone formation. However, it is not recommended for use in men or premenopausal women because it can cause severe side effects such as osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures. In conclusion, Teriparetide is the best agent for this patient's osteoporosis. It has been shown to be effective in increasing bone density and decreasing the risk of fractures with few side effects.

What is the best advice at this point?,C,"Dear user, according to your context, the best advice at this point would be option D.
Advise him to drink plenty of water, move around, cut down the high-protein dietary intake, and return in 2 weeks.
The patient is having a renal colic because of a ureterovesical junction stone that has not yet been passed spontaneously but will be able to pass it by itself in a few days if there are no signs of obstruction or infection. A follow-up visit would confirm this and he may need further therapy depending on the outcome. 
The best management for renal colic is conservative. A trial of spontaneous passage is recommended before intervention. The patient should be offered analgesia, adequate fluid intake and encouraged to mobilize. There is no evidence supporting antibiotics at this time point unless the patient has signs of obstruction or infection. In addition, there is no indication for stone risk evaluation at this time since it may have been passed by itself and further imaging would expose him to unnecessary radiation. A follow-up visit with the urologist will help decide if other conservative measures such as medical expulsive therapy are necessary or whether intervention is needed depending on the size of the stone.
Please let me know what your answer was, so I can learn from my mistakes. 
Thank you, that's all for now, please feel free to ask again!

Which of the following is an absolute contraindication for hyperbaric oxygen therapy?,A,"The correct answer is A (Untreated pneumothorax). 

A pneumothorax, also known as a collapsed lung, occurs when air leaks into the space between your lung and chest wall. This air pushes on the outside of your lung and makes it collapse. In most cases, only a portion of the lung collapses. A complete pneumothorax refers to one that affects your entire lung. Pneumothorax is considered a contraindication for HBOT as it can lead to pressure differential within the lungs, causing barotrauma and further lung injury.
A (Untreated pneumothorax) would be an absolute contraindication as there is a risk of pulmonary barotrauma with untreated pneumothoraces.
B (Claustrophobia) is not necessarily considered a contraindication, but may result in non-compliance. 
C (Sinus infection) would be an absolute contraindication as HBO therapy has been associated with otitismedia and sinus barotrauma. However, once the sinus infection is treated, the patient can then receive HBOT. 
D (Diabetes mellitus) is a relative contraindication for HBOT due to increased risk of hypoglycemia during therapy sessions.

Which ONE of this patient’s clinical parameters is associated with the GREATEST risk of fracture after transplantation?,B,"B, Omeprazole therapy.  Bone fracture is a complication of kidney transplantation, with up to 30% incidence of bone fractures within the first year post-transplant. The risk factors associated with greater posttransplant bone fractures include older age (>50 years), female gender, previous fracture history, and prior steroid use. In this case, omeprazole therapy is an additional factor that contributes to higher risk of fracture post-transplant due to the drug’s association with reduced bone mineral density.

"At this point, which ONE of the following would you recommend for treatment of this woman’s hypercalcemia?",A,"A: The correct answer is A. Zoledronic acid.
Brief Explanation: 
The diagnosis in this case is sarcoidosis-related hypercalcemia (SSc) which is a rare condition associated with granulomatous inflammation of multiple organs, particularly the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes. It is characterized by high levels of serum calcium, low levels of parathyroid hormone, elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, and abnormal bone resorption. The pathogenesis of SSc involves cytokines that promote osteoclast formation and activity leading to increased bone resorption.
The treatment for SSc includes corticosteroids, which are the mainstay of therapy, as well as other drugs such as bisphosphonates (zoledronate), denosumab, and cinacalcet. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation and inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that stimulate osteoclast activity. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity by reducing the number and function of osteoclasts. Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to RANKL (a protein involved in osteoclast activation) and prevents its interaction with RANK receptors on osteoclasts, thereby blocking osteoclast formation and activity. Cinacalcet works by activating the calcium-sensing receptor on parathyroid cells which reduces PTH secretion and lowers serum calcium levels.
In this case, the patient's hypercalcemia improved after treatment with prednisone, but she gained weight and developed Cushingoid features due to steroid side effects. Therefore, alternative therapies such as bisphosphonates (zoledronate) or denosumab should be considered for long-term management of SSc since they do not have the same side effects as corticosteroids. Calcitonin is less effective than other drugs in treating hypercalcemia and has been replaced by newer agents like zoledronate and denosumab. Phenytoin is an anti-epileptic drug that does not have any effect on calcium metabolism or bone remodeling.
In conclusion, SSc is a rare condition characterized by elevated serum calcium levels due to increased bone resorption caused by granulomatous inflammation in multiple organs. Treatment options include corticosteroids, bisphosphonates (zoledronate), denosumab, and cinacalcet depending on the severity of symptoms and response to therapy. Alternative therapies such as zoledronate or denosumab should be considered for long-term management since they do not have the same side effects as corticosteroids which can cause weight gain, Cushingoid features, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, etc. Calcitonin has been replaced by newer drugs like zoledronate and denosumab while phenytoin does not have any effect on calcium metabolism or bone remodeling.

The paper is a prospective clinical study that examined the association between transfusion of longer-term stored blood versus fresher blood and acute lung injury. The study found that transfusion of older blood was associated with increased incidence of transfusion-related acute lung injury and worse outcomes, including increased mortality at 90 days. However, the paper did not find any significant difference in the number of renal replacement therapy (RRT)-free days or duration of mechanical ventilation between the two groups.

Which ONE of the following measures should be included in the policies of your outpatient dialysis center?,D,"The correct answer is A. Isolation of patients who test positive for hepatitis C antibody is a policy that should be followed in an outpatient dialysis center to prevent the spread of infection. Using product water for dialysate only when microbial counts are low can help to reduce the risk of infection, but it is not necessary. Immunization against Staphylococcus aureus is not recommended for all patients in this setting. Hand hygiene after removal of gloves and other personal protective equipment is important, but it should be performed at every opportunity, not just when indicated by policy. Finally, monthly interdisciplinary team meetings with every patient are not necessary. Therefore, the correct answer is A: Isolation of patients who test positive for hepatitis C antibody.

Which of the following is correct with regard to PLA2R-negative MN?,C,"Correct answer: B, Neural epidermal growth factor like 1 protein (NELL-1)–associated MN is a rare cause of primary MN.
Neural epidermal growth factor like 1 protein (NELL-1) was recently identified as an antigenic target in a small subset of patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy (MN). NELL-1 is expressed predominantly on the surface of podocytes and may serve to anchor actin filaments. The pathogenesis of NELL-1–associated MN appears to be mediated by immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibodies directed against NELL-1, which deposit along the glomerular basement membrane in a linear pattern, forming subepithelial electron dense deposits.
NELL-1–associated MN is rare, accounting for only 0.8% of idiopathic MN cases on average and up to 2.9% in some studies. NELL-1–associated MN has been described primarily in male patients with a mean age of 65 years. Although it can be associated with underlying malignancy, the association appears to be lower than that for other anti-podocyte antibodies such as PLA2R and THSD7A, which are both more common causes of idiopathic MN.
The clinical manifestations of NELL-1–associated MN are similar to those observed in patients with anti-PLA2R or anti-THSD7A antibodies. Most patients present with subnephrotic range proteinuria, but approximately 30% have nephrotic syndrome at presentation. The rate of spontaneous remission is low, and the risk for developing endstage renal disease (ESRD) over a period of several years appears to be high.

"In addition to discontinuing warfarin and doxercalciferol, which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate management strategy for this woman?",D,"Option C is correct, and it is the only option that has a definitive effect on calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy. Doxercalciferol causes hypercalcemia in this setting of high calcium levels. Calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy (calciphylaxis) is characterized by subcutaneous nodules that are exquisitely painful, tender to palpation, and progressively worsen despite discontinuation of warfarin in some cases, such as this patient. The differential diagnosis also includes pyoderma gangrenosum, but calciphylaxis has characteristic concentric patterns of calcification on biopsy. Calciphylaxis is thought to be a consequence of systemic vascular calcifications that result in skin necrosis and ulceration. Wide excision of the lesion with grafting if needed is the MOST appropriate treatment for this patient.
A: Cinacalcet is indicated for secondary hyperparathyroidism, not calciphylaxis. It has no effect on calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy.
B: Parathyroidectomy is a last resort because the risk of hypocalcemia in ESRD patients is high and the risks of surgery in this population are significant. It does not have a direct effect on calciphylaxis.
D: Sodium thiosulfate has been shown to improve calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy, but it is not the ONLY treatment that works and it cannot be used alone in management of this condition.

Which ONE of the following interventions has the GREATEST potential to reduce his risk of repeat percutaneous intervention or myocardial infarction over the next 3 years?,B,"Correct answer is D: Optimal medical therapy without intervention

Reasons:
A. Coronary angioplasty with placement of a bare-metal stent
Bare metal stents were first used for coronary revascularization 20 years ago and have undergone numerous improvements, including increased radial strength and less thrombogenic surfaces. Despite these advances, bare-metal stents remain associated with signiﬁcant rates of restenosis or reocclusion because of neointimal hyperplasia at the sites of arterial injury during intervention. 
B. Coronary artery bypass surgery
Compared to coronary angioplasty, CABG has a lower rate of repeat revascularization procedures. However, patients undergoing CABG have greater early postoperative morbidity and mortality than those treated with percutaneous intervention. Moreover, the long-term survival benefit for CABG over coronary angioplasty is less clear, especially in older populations. 
C. Coronary angioplasty with placement of an everolimus-eluting stent
The use of drug-eluting stents has resulted in a significant reduction in the rate of restenosis compared to bare metal stents. However, despite this improved efficacy, drug-eluting stents are associated with higher rates of late stent thrombosis than bare-metal stents, leading some experts to recommend prolonged antiplatelet therapy after intervention and raising concern about a potentially increased risk of bleeding. 
D. Optimal medical therapy without intervention
Optimal medical therapy for patients with stable CAD includes aspirin; a statin; and, in some cases, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta blockers. Although the addition of coronary revascularization to this medical regimen does not reduce mortality, it may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding as well as with complications associated with intervention.

"Question 2476:
Which ONE of the following MOST likely contributes the most to the pathogenesis of salt-sensitive hypertension in obese individuals?",C,"Answer: D (incorrect)
Explanation: Decreased renal expression of Rac1 leads to increased sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule. This mechanism is thought to underlie salt-sensitive hypertension in obese patients.  Obesity-related inflammation, mediated by IL-6 and other cytokines leads to a decreased expression of Rac1, which promotes sodium reabsorption by the sodium/hydrogen exchanger isoform NHE3 located on the apical surface of proximal tubule cells. Increasing renal expression of Rac1 in obese animals with salt-sensitive hypertension prevents the development of hypertension and reduces blood pressure back to normal levels, suggesting that decreased expression of Rac1 may be a therapeutic target for obesity related salt sensitive hypertension.

Hepatic failure or portosystemic shunting will increase the fraction of filtered phosphate that is reabsorbed by renal tubules. This results in elevated serum phosphate levels while urinary phosphate excretion is reduced.

Which ONE of the following is the BEST approach at this time?,C,"C is the correct answer. Sleeve gastrectomy is an appropriate option for patients with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) who are unable to lose weight through other conservative means and need to get a transplant because of their ESKD. The patient in this case is already on dialysis and has significant comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, and history of kidney stones. Therefore, the option to continue with dialysis is not ideal. Orlistat has a relatively small weight-reducing effect, and there are no studies in ESKD patients about its use to lose weight and qualify for transplantation. The patient can be advised to keep trying different conservative means for losing weight (Option A), but this option does not seem feasible because of the lack of success over the past several months.

Her CKD stage 1 eGFR is at the higher end of normal (92 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Even patients with more advanced kidney disease and a lower eGFR can be safely managed during pregnancy if there are no other features such as hypertension or proteinuria.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with the nephrotic syndrome, which is usually not treated in women planning pregnancy; however, this would allow for treatment before she becomes pregnant. Initiating treatment with cyclophosphamide or rituximab would be appropriate but would also require a biopsy to rule out lupus nephritis.

In which of these clinical situations is it most likely that the bone formation rate and the bone resorption rate will be approximately the same?,A,"Correct answer: B (A patient who has been treated with glucocorticoids, who has some metabolic acidosis and weight loss) 
Explanation: Glucocorticoid treatment is associated with a net loss of bone but only if there is increased resorption in excess of formation. The two rates are approximately equal at baseline. A patient who is losing weight, has mild metabolic acidosis and has been treated with glucocorticoids most likely has these rates equal at the time of biopsy. This would be the best answer even without knowing that this is a patient on steroids because there are other causes for loss of bone (e.g. PTH), some of which may lead to an imbalance in resorption and formation.

What is the MOST likely cause of this patient’s nephrotic syndrome?,A,"A. Membranous nephropathy secondary to kidney GVHD is the correct answer 

The patient has a history of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as treatment for acute myelogenous leukemia and presents with new-onset edema affecting her lower extremities up to her thighs and upper extremity involvement, as well as recent laboratory findings consistent with nephrotic syndrome. 
The patient has a history of kidney graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) recently treated with tacrolimus and prednisone which has resolved. Given the association between GVHD and membranous glomerulopathy, it is most likely that this patient's nephrotic syndrome is secondary to kidney graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). 
Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) or hepatic venoocclusive disease has an associated clinical presentation of hepatomegaly, jaundice and/or ascites. This patient's laboratory findings are consistent with nephrotic syndrome but are not consistent with SOS. 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is another complication of HSCT. It presents with thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and renal failure. This patient does have renal failure; however, she has no evidence of thrombocytopenia or hemolysis on laboratory studies.

Which ONE of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in the diagnostic evaluation of this patient?,D,"A: D, order a CT angiogram.  A CT angiogram should be ordered to evaluate for renal artery stenosis, which is a common cause of secondary hypertension that may not have been detected on MRI. Plasma metanephrines are measured to rule out pheochromocytoma as a cause of secondary hypertension; however, this condition is unlikely in the absence of symptoms such as headaches and palpitations. Adrenal vein sampling is indicated when there is clinical suspicion for aldosterone-producing adenomas or primary hyperaldosteronism due to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Polysomnography is useful in evaluating the patient for sleep apnea, which can cause secondary hypertension; however, the presence of this disorder would be supported by clinical symptoms such as witnessed nocturnal choking or gasping and nocturia.

Which ONE of her clinical parameters is MOST highly associated with an increased risk for mortality?,A,"A is the correct answer. Studies have found that severe oliguria (defined as urine output of less than 0.3 mL/kg/hour) for more than a few hours is associated with an increased risk of mortality in patients after cardiac surgery, independent of other factors such as baseline kidney function or postoperative creatinine levels.
In this case, the patient had severe oliguria (<0.1 mL/kg/hour) for a consecutive period of 3 hours before improving to 0.4 mL/kg/hour over the next 3 hours, which puts her at an increased risk of mortality compared to patients with better urine output.
The other options are not as highly associated with an increased risk of mortality in this patient's specific situation. B (her baseline SCr level) and D (her postoperative day 2 creatinine level) are factors that may be helpful for determining the overall prognosis, but they do not specifically indicate an increased risk of mortality during the early period after cardiac surgery like severe oliguria does.
C (her baseline level of albuminuria) is also not as highly associated with an increased risk of mortality in this patient's specific situation. Albuminuria is a marker of kidney damage, but it may not be as strongly correlated with mortality after cardiac surgery compared to other factors such as oliguria or creatinine levels.

Explanation: Patiromer is a potassium-binding polymer that has been used for the treatment of hyperkalemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Fludrocortisone is another option, but it may worsen diarrhea and hypokalemia, which are already present. Isotonic sodium bicarbonate infusion is useful in metabolic acidosis, but this patient has normal bicarbonate levels. Hemodialysis can be considered if the patient’s condition does not improve with medical therapy or if he develops severe hyperkalemia (>6 mEq/L) or symptoms such as muscle weakness, paralysis, or cardiac arrhythmias.

"Question 2691:
Which ONE of the following statements about predialysis education is CORRECT?",A,"The correct answer is A: Patient-targeted educational interventions increase the odds of receiving PD as the initial treatment modality.
In a randomized controlled trial by Devins et al, patients who received patient-targeted education were more likely to receive peritoneal dialysis (PD) than those in the control group (35% vs 14%, respectively).  The odds of receiving PD increased in the group that received patient-targeted education as compared to the control group.
For context, predialysis education involves providing patients with information about dialysis options and helping them make informed decisions about their treatment. Unplanned dialysis initiation occurs when a patient starts dialysis without prior planning or preparation, often due to emergency situations or rapid disease progression.  Educating patients about therapy options can help them feel more prepared and confident in their treatment choices, which may lead to improved outcomes and better quality of life.

B. It will delay progression of his CKD - WRONG - This answer choice is incorrect because renal stenting does NOT delay the progression of CKD. The patient's CKD may have already progressed to a point that is irreversible, and this cannot be altered by stenting.
C. It will decrease his risk of death from renal or cardiovascular causes - WRONG - This answer choice is incorrect because renal stenting does NOT decrease the patient's risk of death from renal OR cardiovascular causes. Renal stenting may improve the patient's symptoms, but it does not impact his risk of death from either cause.
D. It will not impact the rate of CKD progression - CORRECT

Which ONE of the following has MOST likely increased this man’s risk for calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy?,E,"Based on the information provided, the correct answer is option C: Dialysate calcium of 2.5 mEq/L. Calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is a rare but serious complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are on hemodialysis. It is characterized by calcification and sclerosis of small blood vessels, leading to painful skin lesions, ulcerations, gangrene, and even limb amputation in severe cases.
The risk factors for CUA include high calcium load from dialysate, oral medications (such as calcium-based phosphate binders), hyperparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and high blood pressure. Among these risk factors, the most significant factor is the concentration of calcium in the dialysis bath.
The patient's dialysate composition includes a calcium level of 2.5 mEq/L, which is considered high for patients with ESRD who are on hemodialysis. The recommended dialysate calcium levels vary depending on the patient's serum calcium and phosphorus levels, but generally range from 1.0 to 1.75 mEq/L. A higher level of dialysate calcium can increase the risk of vascular calcification and CUA in patients with ESRD.
The other options, such as hypertension, irbesartan (an angiotensin II receptor blocker), intravenous epoetin (a hematopoietic growth factor), and multiple daily insulin injections, are not directly associated with CUA or its risk factors. Although some studies suggest that antihypertensive medications such as irbesartan may have a protective effect on vascular calcification, the evidence is inconclusive, and these medications should be used according to the patient's blood pressure control and other comorbidities.
Therefore, based on the provided information, the most likely answer that has increased this man’s risk for calciﬁc uremic arteriolopathy is option C: Dialysate calcium of 2.5 mEq/L. It is important to monitor and optimize dialysis parameters to prevent complications such as CUA in patients with ESRD who are on hemodialysis.

Which of the following is the best approach to evaluate for the white-coat effect?,D,"Option C is correct.
The white-coat effect is an increase in systolic and diastolic BP while the patient is in a clinical setting, usually due to increased anxiety or fear of negative ﬁndings at the visit. It may be difficult for patients to distinguish between true elevation of BP and the white-coat effect. A study by Parati et al found that ambulatory BP monitoring was able to detect white-coat hypertension in 50% of patients, compared with 16% detected using ofﬁce readings alone (4).
Patients who present with elevated clinical BP but normal home blood pressure may be experiencing the white coat effect. This phenomenon is typically caused by increased anxiety while visiting a clinical setting and may require further evaluation for conﬁrmation. Patients should maintain a daily log of home blood pressure readings over several days to determine an average resting BP level. The patient should also calibrate their home BP cuff against the clinical BP cuff, as there may be differences in readings between cuffs.
In some cases, it may be necessary to arrange for a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor. This device measures the patient’s resting BP level over a longer period of time, which can provide a more accurate picture of their overall cardiovascular health and help rule out the white coat effect (3).
The white coat effect is an important consideration in diagnosing hypertension, as it may lead to misdiagnosis or unnecessary treatment. By implementing these measures and arranging for further evaluation when necessary, clinicians can help ensure that patients receive accurate and appropriate care.

Which ONE of the following statements regarding cinacalcet is CORRECT?,A,"A. Addition of cinacalcet is appropriate based on this patient’s laboratory findings
- Cinacalcet hydrochloride (Sensipar) inhibits the parathyroid calcium-sensing receptor, which stimulates PTH secretion when blood ionized calcium levels are above a normal physiologic threshold. In the clinical trial of cinacalcet therapy in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (Evaluation of Cinacalcet Hydrochloride Therapy to Lower Cardio-vascular Events), cinacalcet was used in conjunction with calcium and phosphate binders and vitamin D analogs, as needed. In the control arm, these agents were also used; additionally, cinacalcet could be added after 6 months if serum PTH levels remained above a speciﬁed threshold. Treatment with cinacalcet resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of serum PTH levels compared with the control group, and cinacalcet was associated with lower cardiovascular and all-cause mortality than standard therapy. Cinacalcet was also associated with improved patient-reported physical health scores on validated questionnaires.

Which of the following agents could be used for his osteoporosis?,C,"The correct answer is B: denosumab. 
Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the RANKL receptor, thus decreasing osteoclastic activity and increasing bone density. It has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of osteoporosis in patients with CKD stages 3–5D, and is approved by the FDA for this indication.
Denosumab should be avoided in patients with hypocalcemia or who have a history of hypersensitivity reaction to denosumab. It has been associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), similar to bisphosphonates, as well as atypical fractures of long bones.
Pamidronate is not approved for treatment of osteoporosis.
Teriparatide increases bone formation and may decrease bone resorption. It is effective in treating postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis (those who have a history of hip fracture or multiple vertebral compression fractures).  Teriparatide is contraindicated in patients with CKD, so this would be an incorrect option.
Romosozumab is a sclerostin monoclonal antibody that increases bone formation and decreases bone resorption. It has been shown to increase BMD and decrease the risk of fracture in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, including those at high fracture risk.  The FDA requires a boxed warning for romosozumab regarding an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cardiovascular death.

Oxygen requirement,C,"[BACKGROUND]
- [TEXT]: A 69-year-old Hispanic man with ESKD secondary to polycystic kidney disease received a deceased donor kidney transplant 5 years ago. His post-transplantation course was complicated by multiple urinary tract infections and concomitant AKI leading to chronic allograft injury with baseline serum creatinine of 1.8 mg/dl (normal range < 1.3 mg/dl). His medical history includes coronary artery disease and hypertension. He is admitted to the hospital with multifocal pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 and currently receives supplemental oxygen 3 L/min via nasal cannula to maintain a SpO2 of 94%. His mycophenolate mofetil was held, and he was continued on tacrolimus with target trough levels of 3 to 5 ng/ml and prednisone 5 mg daily. His blood work on admission showed a serum creatinine of 2.5 mg/dl and white blood cell count of 3,500/µl (normal range: 4,800–10,800 /µl) with lymphocyte count of 600/µl (normal range 1,000–4,800/µl. He was started on dexamethasone treatment. Which ONE of the following factors has NOT been associated with increased risk of mortality in transplant recipients with COVID-19?

Which ONE of the following tests should be performed next?,A,"I recommend option D for your patient. If you need more information, here is an explanation:
The most likely cause of this patient's hematuria would be a benign prostatic hyperplasia. This is due to the patient's age and gender (63-year old white male), his current cigarette smoking status, history of low dose aspirin use, normal physical examination except for an enlarged prostate, and low PSA level. It would be inappropriate to perform a cystoscopy without imaging due to the fact that this patient's ultrasound was negative. A 24-hour urine for albumin excretion would not help us determine the etiology of hematuria as it does not differentiate between glomerular and non-glomerular causes of hematuria. Serum C3, C4, and an anti-nuclear antibody would be useful in a younger patient with positive family history who has experienced an acute episode of hematuria. This patient's laboratory results are all within normal limits except for the urinalysis showing microscopic hematuria. A serum free light chain assay is indicated due to the fact that 25%-30% of this patient's erythrocytes were dysmorphic, suggesting a glomerular cause.

What is the MOST likely mode of inheritance of this condition?,C,"The correct answer is B. Autosomal Recessive. The mode of inheritance for Alport Syndrome is autosomal recessive, meaning both parents must carry the gene mutation and pass it on to their offspring in order for the disease to manifest. In this case, one parent would have had to carry the mutated COL4A3 or COL4A4 gene and pass it onto their child, who then inherited a second copy of the defective gene from the other parent. This combination of genetic mutations leads to Alport Syndrome.

Options:
A. Hypernatremia is iatrogenic and requires intravenous or oral free water supplementation
B. Hypernatremia is secondary to lithium-induced partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
C. Hypernatremia is secondary to osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia
D. Hypernatremia is secondary to lithium-induced complete nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
A: Incorrect. In the setting of hyponatremia (Na 155 mmol/L), this answer choice would be correct if the patient had hypernatremia instead.
B: Correct. Lithium-induced partial nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is characterized by a low or normal serum osmolarity and an elevated urine osmolality >300 mOsm/kg. This is because of the inability of lithium to impair renal tubular sensitivity to arginine vasopressin, resulting in persistent diuresis despite hypo-osmolality. In this case, the patient’s urine osmolarity was 629 mOsm/kg.
C: Incorrect. Osmotic diuresis is a cause of dilutional hyponatremia due to hyperglycemia. The blood glucose level in this question was elevated at 170 mg/dl, but the urine osmolarity was >300 mOsm/kg which would be inconsistent with dilutional hyponatremia.
D: Incorrect. Lithium-induced complete nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is characterized by a low or normal serum osmolarity and an elevated urine osmolality <300 mOsm/kg due to the inability of lithium to stimulate renal tubular sensitivity to arginine vasopressin. In this case, the patient’s urine osmolarity was 629 mOsm/kg.

C. This patient's BUN and creatinine are higher than her baseline, but they have been stable at this level for several years. If there is a concern for overdiuresis or intravascular volume depletion as the cause of the increased serum potassium levels, then the diuretic should be discontinued or reduced in dose (and replaced with furosemide if necessary). However, there are no signs or symptoms to suggest these issues. 
D. The patient's BP is well controlled on enalapril and atorvastatin. There is no indication to discontinue either medication. Enalapril can be safely used in patients with CKD, so there is no rationale to switch to an ACEI-ARB combination pill at this time.

Which mechanism explains how SNPs in the promoter region of uromodulin may predispose to hypertension?,C,"The correct answer is C. Endocytosis of transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 (TRPV5) in the distal convoluted tubule.
Certain SNPs within the promoter region of uromodulin can alter expression of the protein and may lead to hypertension. Uromodulin is highly expressed in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, where it normally increases endocytosis of TRPV5 (a calcium channel). A reduced activity of this protein leads to an increase in calcium reabsorption and subsequently an increase in blood pressure.
",Success
Which ONE of the following is the MOST likely cause of this man's hyperphosphatemia?,C,"C. Elevated IgG kappa monoclonal protein

In this case the patient's hyperphosphatemia is most likely due to increased bone resorption from elevation of an IgG kappa monoclonal protein in a newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The serum phosphorus level is generally determined by 3 factors: parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23). Phosphaturic hormones such as parathyroid hormone and FGF-23 act to lower the serum phosphorus level by decreasing renal reabsorption of phosphate in the proximal tubule. Parathyroid hormone also mobilizes calcium from bone, resulting in secondary hyperparathyroidism with increased bone resorption and hyperphosphatemia, while FGF-23 decreases the renal threshold for phosphorus excretion by downregulating phosphate transporters. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D acts to increase the serum phosphorus level by increasing proximal tubule reabsorption and mobilizing calcium from bone with subsequent secondary hyperparathyroidism. The presence of monoclonal proteins can cause renal dysfunction through multiple mechanisms, including light chain cast nephropathy, amyloidosis, or deposition disease. In this case the patient's elevated free kappa-light chains are 2 orders of magnitude greater than his free lambda light chains, which supports a diagnosis of light chain deposition disease. The patient presents with mildly decreased GFR, but no other findings to suggest renal failure or tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS is caused by the rapid lysis of malignant cells that release their intracellular contents into the systemic circulation, leading to electrolyte imbalance and organ dysfunction. The 2 most common manifestations of TLS are hyperuricemia and hyperphosphatemia. This patient's normal uric acid level is not consistent with a diagnosis of TLS. In addition, his acute kidney injury is more likely due to the combination of dehydration and new use of a proteasome inhibitor such as bortezomib. This patient has no evidence of bone metastasis that could lead to elevated phosphate levels from tumor lysis or osteolytic activity. The patient's history of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and normal calcium level make hyperparathyroidism and secondary hyperparathyroidism unlikely, respectively. Finally, there are no signs or symptoms to suggest a diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism.

Which ONE of the following should you tell her about pancreas transplantation?,A,"B. Pancreas transplantation alone is associated with inferior outcomes compared with simultaneous kidney pancreas transplantation
The correct answer is B. Pancreas transplantation alone is associated with inferior outcomes compared with simultaneous kidney pancreas transplantation. 

Pancreas after kidney (PAK) and simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplants are both options for diabetic patients in need of renal replacement therapy. SPK is the most common type of pancreas transplant performed, as this procedure allows patients to achieve insulin independence while also addressing their CKD. While PAK allows kidney allografts to function without exposure to calcineurin-mediated diabetogenic injury, it does not completely address end-stage renal disease (ESRD), as patients still need to be on insulin therapy. 

Additionally, pancreas transplantation alone is associated with inferior outcomes compared to SPK in terms of rejection rates and graft survival. This may be due to differences in the immunological environment between the two types of transplants, as well as other factors such as donor-recipient matching and postoperative care protocols. 

Despite these challenges, there are still many advantages associated with pancreas transplantation alone that make it a viable option for certain patients who do not have access to an SPK program or who would prefer not to undergo simultaneous surgery due to increased risk factors or other medical reasons. These include improved glycemic control, reduced incidence of hypoglycemia events, and decreased insulin requirements post-transplantation compared with pre-operative levels. 

For patients considering pancreas transplantation alone or SPK transplants, it is important that they receive appropriate counseling about the risks and benefits associated with each type of procedure in order to make an informed decision about their care. Additionally, they should be aware of potential complications related to either procedure so that they can properly manage them if they occur after surgery. 

Overall, while SPK transplants may provide better outcomes than PAK for some individuals with diabetes mellitus and ESRD who need renal replacement therapy, pancreas transplantation alone remains a viable option depending on individual circumstances. It is important that healthcare providers discuss all available options thoroughly when considering which type of transplant would best suit each patient’s needs so that optimal results can be achieved post-operatively.

Which ONE of the following should you tell her about statin therapy and outcomes after kidney transplantation?,A,"The correct answer choice is C. Statin therapy is ineffective after transplantation because of the impact of immunosuppression on lipid levels. After kidney transplantation, patients are at increased risk for adverse cardiovascular events, and statins are effective for primary and secondary prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events in this population. However, some studies have shown that the use of statins does not significantly impact mortality after kidney transplantation. This may be due to the effects of immunosuppression on lipid metabolism, as some evidence suggests that calcineurin inhibitors and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors can lead to hyperlipidemia by increasing cholesterol synthesis and decreasing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) clearance. Therefore, it is important to consider these potential effects when prescribing statins for patients after kidney transplantation.

What is the correct statement regarding the cause of and diagnostic workup for hypotonic polyuria?,B,"Answer: C. In the setting of sarcoidosis, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus due to hypercalcemia is the most likely cause of hypernatremia
Explanation: The patient's history and laboratory workup are consistent with central diabetes insipidus caused by sarcoidosis.  The clinical presentation, labs including hyponatremia (147 mmol/L), urine sodium <20 mEq/L, high urine osmolarity <150 mOsm/kg, polyuria >3 liters/day, low BUN, and hypercalcemia is consistent with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.  In this patient with sarcoidosis the most common cause of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is hypercalcemia (either as a direct result of sarcoidosis or secondary to calcium supplementation).
