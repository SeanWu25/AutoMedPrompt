Question,Ground Truth,Prediction,Status
"A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?",C,"The correct answer is B. Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report.

As a healthcare professional, it is essential to maintain transparency and honesty with patients, even when mistakes occur. Failing to disclose the error to the patient and omitting it from the operative report is unethical and can lead to mistrust and potential harm to the patient.

The resident should disclose the error to the patient in a compassionate and honest manner, explaining what happened, how it was repaired, and what steps will be taken to prevent similar errors in the future. Additionally, the resident should ensure that the operative report accurately reflects the events of the surgery, including the complication and its repair.

Options A, C, D, and E are not correct because:

A. Disclosing the error to the patient but leaving it out of the operative report is incomplete and unethical.

C. Telling the attending that he cannot fail to disclose the mistake may lead to conflict, but it does not address the primary issue of patient disclosure and accurate reporting.

D. Reporting the physician to the ethics committee may be premature and may not address the immediate need for patient disclosure and accurate reporting.

E. Refusing to dictate the operative report is not a constructive solution and may lead to further complications.",Success
A 67-year-old man with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of ringing sensation in his ear. He received this first course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 week ago. Pure tone audiometry shows a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB. The expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to which of the following actions?,E,"The correct answer is C. Hyperstabilization of microtubules.

The patient's symptoms, specifically the ringing sensation in the ear (tinnitus) and sensorineural hearing loss, are consistent with ototoxicity, a known side effect of certain chemotherapeutic agents. The most likely culprit is cisplatin, a platinum-based chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.

Cisplatin's mechanism of action involves forming cross-links with DNA, which is option E. However, this is not the correct answer because the question asks about the expected beneficial effect of the drug, not the mechanism of ototoxicity.

The correct answer, option C, refers to the mechanism of action of taxanes, a class of chemotherapy drugs that includes paclitaxel and docetaxel. These drugs work by hyperstabilizing microtubules, which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (programmed cell death). While taxanes are not typically used to treat bladder cancer, they are used to treat other types of cancer, and their mechanism of action is distinct from that of cisplatin.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the mechanism of action of cisplatin:

A. Inhibition of thymidine synthesis is a mechanism of action of antimetabolite chemotherapy drugs, such as methotrexate.

B. Inhibition of proteasome is a mechanism of action of proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib.

D. Generation of free radicals is a mechanism of action of some chemotherapy drugs, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the mechanism of action of cisplatin.",Success
"Two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catherization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man has decreased urinary output and malaise. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin and naproxen. He was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Examination shows mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin count 14 g/dL
Leukocyte count 16,400/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 56%
Eosinophils 11%
Lymphocytes 31%
Monocytes 2%
Platelet count 260,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 68 mm/h
Serum
Urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL
Creatinine 4.2 mg/dL
Renal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?""",C,"The correct answer is C. Cholesterol embolization.

The patient's symptoms, including decreased urinary output, malaise, and mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet, are consistent with cholesterol embolization. The renal biopsy finding of intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles is also characteristic of cholesterol embolization. This condition can occur after cardiac catheterization, as in this case, and is caused by the dislodging of cholesterol plaques from the aorta, which then embolize to smaller arteries, including those in the kidneys.",Success
"A 39-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of fevers, chills, and left lower quadrant pain. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.3°F), pulse is 126/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. There is blood oozing around the site of a peripheral intravenous line. Pelvic examination shows mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os and left adnexal tenderness. Laboratory studies show:
Platelet count 14,200/mm3
Fibrinogen 83 mg/mL (N = 200–430 mg/dL)
D-dimer 965 ng/mL (N < 500 ng/mL)
When phenol is applied to a sample of the patient's blood at 90°C, a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain is identified. A blood culture is most likely to show which of the following?""",D,"The correct answer is B. Encapsulated, gram-negative coccobacilli forming grey-colored colonies on charcoal blood agar.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest septic shock, likely due to a bacterial infection. The presence of mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os and left adnexal tenderness suggests a genital tract infection. The laboratory results, including thrombocytopenia, low fibrinogen, and elevated D-dimer, are consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The identification of a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain in the patient's blood suggests the presence of lipoteichoic acid, a component of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria. However, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are more consistent with a gram-negative bacterial infection.

The correct answer is B, which corresponds to Neisseria meningitidis, a gram-negative coccobacillus that can cause septic shock and DIC. The description of grey-colored colonies on charcoal blood agar is consistent with N. meningitidis.",Success
"A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of itchy, watery eyes for the past week. He has also been sneezing multiple times a day during this period. He had a similar episode 1 year ago around springtime. He has iron deficiency anemia and ankylosing spondylitis. Current medications include ferrous sulfate, artificial tear drops, and indomethacin. He works as an elementary school teacher. His vital signs are within normal limits. Visual acuity is 20/20 without correction. Physical examination shows bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge. The pupils are 3 mm, equal, and reactive to light. Examination of the anterior chamber of the eye is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",B,"The correct answer is B. Ketotifen eye drops.

The patient's symptoms of itchy, watery eyes, and sneezing are consistent with allergic conjunctivitis, which is likely caused by seasonal allergies (given the similar episode 1 year ago around springtime). Ketotifen is an antihistamine eye drop that is commonly used to treat allergic conjunctivitis. It helps to relieve itching, redness, and tearing associated with allergies.

Erythromycin ointment (A) is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, not allergic conjunctivitis. Warm compresses (C) may provide some relief, but they are not a specific treatment for allergic conjunctivitis. Fluorometholone eye drops (D) are a corticosteroid used to treat inflammation, but they may not be necessary in this case, and they can have side effects with long-term use. Latanoprost eye drops (E) are used to treat glaucoma, not allergic conjunctivitis.",Success
A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of progressively worsening chest pain and nausea that started at a local bar 30 minutes prior. The pain radiates to the epigastric area. He has a 5-year history of untreated hypertension. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 5 years and started abusing cocaine 2 weeks before his emergency room visit. The patient is diaphoretic and in marked distress. What should be the first step in management?,E,"The correct answer is C. Nitroglycerin.

The patient's symptoms, such as chest pain radiating to the epigastric area, diaphoresis, and marked distress, are consistent with a possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or myocardial infarction (MI). Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator that can help relieve chest pain and reduce cardiac workload. It is a first-line medication in the management of ACS and MI.

Diltiazem (A) is a calcium channel blocker that can be used to treat hypertension, but it is not the first step in managing this patient's symptoms. Labetalol (B) is a beta blocker that can be used to treat hypertension and tachycardia, but it may not be the best initial choice in this scenario. Propranolol (D) is a non-selective beta blocker that can exacerbate cocaine-induced coronary vasoconstriction and is contraindicated in this scenario. Reassurance and continuous monitoring (E) are important, but they should not be the first step in management. The patient's symptoms require immediate attention and treatment.",Success
A 68-year-old male comes to the physician for evaluation of right flank pain. He has a history of diabetes and peripheral artery disease. His blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows abdominal tenderness and right flank tenderness. An ultrasound shows dilation of the right ureter and renal pelvis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?,D,"The correct answer is B. Benign prostatic hyperplasia.

The patient's symptoms of right flank pain, abdominal tenderness, and right flank tenderness, along with the ultrasound findings of dilation of the right ureter and renal pelvis, suggest an obstruction of the urinary tract. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common cause of urinary tract obstruction in older men, and it can cause hydronephrosis (dilation of the renal pelvis and ureter) due to blockage of the urethra. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms or findings suggestive of other options make BPH the most likely underlying cause of his condition.",Success
"A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after the onset of acute chest pain. He has hypertension and asthma. Current medications include atorvastatin, lisinopril, and an albuterol inhaler. He appears pale and diaphoretic. His pulse is 114/min and blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg. An ECG shows ST-segment depressions in leads II, III, and aVF. Laboratory studies show an increased serum troponin T concentration. The patient is treated for acute coronary syndrome and undergoes percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. At the time of discharge, echocardiography shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 58%. In addition to aspirin, which of the following drugs should be added to this patient's medication regimen?",C,"The correct answer is C. Clopidogrel.

The patient has had an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and has undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Aspirin is already being used, and clopidogrel is typically added to aspirin as dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent stent thrombosis and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with ACS who have undergone PTCA.

Nifedipine (A) is a calcium channel blocker that may be used to treat hypertension or angina, but it is not typically added to the medication regimen in this scenario.

Enoxaparin (B) is a low-molecular-weight heparin that may be used as an anticoagulant in the acute management of ACS, but it is not typically continued long-term after hospital discharge.

Spironolactone (D) is a potassium-sparing diuretic that may be used to treat heart failure, but it is not typically added to the medication regimen in this scenario, especially since the patient's left ventricular ejection fraction is 58%, which is relatively preserved.

Propranolol (E) is a beta blocker that may be used to treat hypertension, angina, or heart failure, but it is not typically added to the medication regimen in this scenario, especially since the patient's left ventricular ejection fraction is 58%, which is relatively preserved.",Success
"A 37-year-old-woman presents to her primary care physician requesting a new form of birth control. She has been utilizing oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for the past 8 years, but asks to switch to an intrauterine device (IUD). Her vital signs are: blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg, pulse 73/min and respiratory rate 16/min. She is afebrile. Physical examination is within normal limits. Which of the following past medical history statements would make copper IUD placement contraindicated in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Copper IUDs are generally contraindicated in women with active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) because the IUD can increase the risk of further infection and complications. The other options are not contraindications for copper IUD placement:

A. A history of stroke or venous thromboembolism is a contraindication for hormonal IUDs, not copper IUDs.

B. Current tobacco use is not a contraindication for IUD placement.

D. Past medical history of breast cancer is not a contraindication for copper IUD placement.

E. Known liver neoplasm is not a contraindication for copper IUD placement.",Success

"A 24-year-old G2P1 woman at 39 weeks’ gestation presents to the emergency department complaining of painful contractions occurring every 10 minutes for the past 2 hours, consistent with latent labor. She says she has not experienced vaginal discharge, bleeding, or fluid leakage, and is currently taking no medications. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 86/min, and temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F). She has had little prenatal care and uses condoms inconsistently. Her sexually transmitted infections status is unknown. As part of the patient’s workup, she undergoes a series of rapid screening tests that result in the administration of zidovudine during delivery. The infant is also given zidovudine to reduce the risk of transmission. A confirmatory test is then performed in the mother to confirm the diagnosis of HIV. Which of the following is most true about the confirmatory test?",E,"The correct answer is E. It is an HIV-1/HIV2 antibody differentiation immunoassay.

The scenario describes a patient who undergoes rapid screening tests for HIV during labor, and the results prompt the administration of zidovudine to the mother and infant to reduce the risk of transmission. A confirmatory test is then performed to confirm the diagnosis of HIV.

The correct answer is E, an HIV-1/HIV2 antibody differentiation immunoassay. This type of test is used to confirm the presence of HIV antibodies and to differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections.

The other options are incorrect:

A. Genotyping is a test used to determine the genetic sequence of the virus, which is not the purpose of a confirmatory test in this scenario.

B. A Western blot is a type of confirmatory test used to detect the presence of HIV antibodies, but it is not specifically used to identify DNA-binding proteins.

C. A Northern blot is a laboratory technique used to detect specific RNA sequences, but it is not used to confirm HIV diagnosis.

D. A Northern blot is not used to identify DNA, and it is not a confirmatory test for HIV diagnosis.",Success
"A 72-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue and worsening abdominal pain. During this period, he also has excessive night sweats and shortness of breath on exertion. Over the past 3 months, he has had a 5.6-kg (12-lb) weight loss. He had a myocardial infarction 3 years ago. He has hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic bronchitis. His medications include insulin, aspirin, lisinopril, and an albuterol inhaler. He has smoked half a pack of cigarettes for the past 45 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. The spleen is palpated 6 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 6.4 g/dL

A blood smear is shown. Bone marrow aspiration shows extensive fibrosis and a few scattered plasma cells. A JAK 2 assay is positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",D,"The correct answer is D. Ruxolitinib.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm. The presence of a JAK2 mutation, splenomegaly, anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia support this diagnosis. The bone marrow aspiration showing extensive fibrosis and a few scattered plasma cells is also consistent with PMF.

Ruxolitinib is a JAK inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis, including PMF. It has been shown to improve symptoms, reduce spleen size, and improve quality of life in patients with myelofibrosis.

Cladribine (A) is a chemotherapy agent that is not typically used to treat myelofibrosis. Prednisone (B) may be used to treat anemia or other symptoms in patients with myelofibrosis, but it is not a primary treatment for the disease. Imatinib (C) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia, but it is not effective in myelofibrosis. Stem cell transplantation (E) may be considered in some patients with myelofibrosis, but it is typically reserved for younger patients with high-risk disease and is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient.",Success
A 20-year-old man comes to the physician because of worsening gait unsteadiness and bilateral hearing loss for 1 month. He has had intermittent tingling sensations on both cheeks over this time period. He has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications. Audiometry shows bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Genetic evaluation shows a mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes merlin. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions?,B,"The correct answer is B. Meningioma.

The patient's symptoms, including gait unsteadiness, bilateral hearing loss, and tingling sensations on the cheeks, are consistent with a diagnosis of Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The genetic evaluation showing a mutation of the tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes merlin, also known as the NF2 gene, confirms this diagnosis.

NF2 is a genetic disorder that increases the risk of developing certain types of tumors, including meningiomas, schwannomas, and ependymomas. Meningiomas are the most common type of tumor associated with NF2, and they can occur in the brain, spine, or peripheral nerves.

The other options are not directly related to NF2:

A. Renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer that is not typically associated with NF2.

C. Astrocytoma is a type of brain tumor that can occur in people with NF2, but it is not as strongly associated with the condition as meningioma.

D. Vascular malformations are not a typical feature of NF2.

"A 47-year-old executive schedules an appointment his physician for a routine medical check-up. He currently has no complaints and claims to be “as fit as a fiddle.” The physical examination findings are unremarkable, except for a mid-systolic murmur heard in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids on auscultation. The physician instructs the patient to stand from a supine position with the stethoscope still placed on his chest. Which of the following changes would occur with this maneuver?",E,"The correct answer is E. A reduction in diastolic filling time.

When the patient stands up from a supine position, the venous return to the heart decreases due to gravity, which reduces the diastolic filling time. This maneuver is known as the ""stand-up test"" or ""postural test"". It is used to help distinguish between different types of murmurs, particularly to differentiate between hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and other conditions.

In HOCM, the murmur will increase in intensity with standing, whereas in other conditions, the murmur will decrease in intensity. The reduction in diastolic filling time with standing will also reduce the intensity of murmurs that are dependent on flow, such as mitral regurgitation.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Right atrial pressure will decrease with standing, not increase.

B. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure will decrease with standing, not increase.

C. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure will decrease with standing, not increase.

D. The slope of the pacemaker potential is not directly affected by standing up.",Success
"A microbiologist is studying the emergence of a virulent strain of the virus. After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection. Which of the following viruses is capable of undergoing the above-mentioned process?",D,"The correct answer is D. Rotavirus.

The process described is called reassortment, which is a mechanism of genetic recombination that occurs in certain viruses, including rotaviruses. Rotaviruses have a segmented genome, consisting of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA. When a host cell is co-infected with two different rotaviruses, the genome segments from each virus can reassort and combine in new ways, resulting in the formation of novel virus particles with unique genetic compositions. This process can lead to the emergence of new strains of rotavirus.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Cytomegalovirus and B. Epstein-Barr virus are herpesviruses, which do not have segmented genomes and do not undergo reassortment.

C. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that undergoes recombination, but not reassortment.

E. Vaccinia virus is a poxvirus that does not have a segmented genome and does not undergo reassortment.",Success
"A 59-year-old overweight woman presents to the urgent care clinic with the complaint of severe abdominal pain for the past 2 hours. She also complains of a dull pain in her back with nausea and vomiting several times. Her pain has no relation with food.

However, a CT scan of the abdomen shows a calcified mass near her gallbladder. Which of the following diagnoses should be excluded first in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Gallbladder cancer.

The patient's symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, are non-specific and could be related to several conditions. However, the presence of a calcified mass near the gallbladder on the CT scan raises the suspicion of gallbladder cancer. Given the patient's family history of abdominal cancer, it is essential to exclude gallbladder cancer as a potential diagnosis.",Success
"A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a β-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen. Which of the following mediators is described in this experimental study?",E,"The correct answer is E. IL-4.

The description in the question suggests that the experimental therapy targets a mediator that promotes class switching of antibodies, which is a key feature of IL-4. IL-4 is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the development of allergic responses, including asthma. It promotes the production of IgE antibodies, which are responsible for triggering allergic reactions. By reducing IL-4 activity, the experimental therapy aims to decrease the exaggerated response observed during asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen.

IL-5 (Option A) is involved in eosinophilic inflammation, but it is not directly related to class switching of antibodies.

IL-2 (Option B) is a T-cell growth factor, but it is not specifically involved in allergic responses or class switching of antibodies.

IL-10 (Option C) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can suppress allergic responses, but it is not directly involved in class switching of antibodies.

IL-13 (Option D) is involved in allergic responses, but it is not the primary cytokine responsible for class switching of antibodies.",Success

Diagnostic evaluation fails to discover an exact etiology of the boy's symptoms and the episode is classified as a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). The risk profile for BRUE in infants remains largely unknown. The pediatrician who saw the boy in the emergency department is trying to identify risk factors for BRUE. She is aware of several confounders, including age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She recruits 75 infants under 1 year of age with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE of the same age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She then compares the two groups with regard to history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection. Which of the following methods was conducted to control confounding bias in the study?",E,"The correct answer is E. Matching.

In this study, the researcher recruited two groups of infants: 75 with BRUE and 75 without BRUE. To control for confounding bias, she matched the two groups on certain characteristics, such as age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. This is an example of matching, which is a technique used to control for confounding variables by ensuring that the groups being compared are similar in terms of these variables.

The other options are not correct:

A. Stratified analysis is a method used to analyze data after it has been collected, whereas matching is a method used to control for confounding bias during the study design phase.

B. Blinding is a technique used to prevent bias by concealing information from participants or researchers, but it is not relevant to controlling confounding bias in this study.

"A 29-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to central chest pain over the past 3 days which is constant and unrelated to exertion. The pain is sharp, severe, increases when lying down, and improves with leaning forward. The pain also radiates to his shoulders and neck. The patient has no past medical history. He has smoked 10 cigarettes per day for the past 7 years and occasionally drinks alcohol. He presents with vital signs: blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, regular radial pulse of 95/min, and temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F). On physical exam, a scratching sound of to-and-from character is audible over the left sternal border at end-expiration with the patient leaning forward. His chest X-ray is normal and ECG is shown in the picture. Which of the following is the optimal therapy for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with acute pericarditis, an inflammation of the pericardium, the sac that surrounds the heart. The scratching sound audible over the left sternal border, known as a pericardial friction rub, is a classic finding in pericarditis.

The ECG shows ST segment elevation in multiple leads, which is also consistent with acute pericarditis.

The optimal therapy for acute pericarditis is a combination of ibuprofen and colchicine. Ibuprofen is used to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms, while colchicine is used to reduce the risk of recurrent pericarditis. Omeprazole may be added to protect the stomach from the adverse effects of ibuprofen.

Indomethacin is not the optimal choice because it can cause coronary vasoconstriction and worsen the condition. Prednisone is not recommended as a first-line therapy for acute pericarditis, and pericardiocentesis and pericardiectomy are invasive procedures that are not indicated in this patient.",Success

She recently observed an enlargement of her axillary lymph nodes, which she examines on a weekly basis. She has a remote history of breast cancer in her 60s that was treated with radiation and chemotherapy. She also reports a history of extensive travel to Africa and a 30-pack-year history of smoking. On physical exam, several axillary lymph nodes are palpable with a large non-tender palpable mass in her right axilla measuring 10 x 8 cm. Fine-needle aspiration demonstrates what the pathologist describes as ""a centroblastic and immunoblastic cell presence, suspicious for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)–diffuse large B cell variant"". Which of the following risk factors is responsible for this patient’s condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Previous radiation therapy.

The patient's history of radiation therapy for breast cancer is a risk factor for developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), specifically diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Radiation therapy is a known risk factor for the development of NHL, particularly in older adults.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:

A. Travel to Africa is not a risk factor for NHL.

B. Axillary lymph node involvement is a symptom of the patient's condition, not a risk factor.

D. Female gender is not a specific risk factor for NHL, although women are more likely to develop certain subtypes of NHL.

"A 3-month-old infant is brought to her pediatrician because she coughs and seems to have difficulty breathing while feeding. In addition, she seems to have less energy compared to other babies and appears listless throughout the day. She was born by cesarean section to a G1P1 woman with no prior medical history and had a normal APGAR score at birth. Her parents say that she has never been observed to turn blue. Physical exam reveals a high-pitched holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following abnormalities?",A,"The correct answer is A. 22q11 deletion.

The symptoms described, such as coughing, difficulty breathing while feeding, and a high-pitched holosystolic murmur, are consistent with a congenital heart defect. The 22q11 deletion is a genetic disorder that is associated with a range of congenital anomalies, including heart defects, particularly ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and tetralogy of Fallot. The physical exam finding of a high-pitched holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border is also consistent with a VSD.

The other options are not directly related to the symptoms described:

B. Deletion of genes on chromosome 7 is associated with cystic fibrosis, which is not consistent with the symptoms described.

C. Lithium exposure in utero is associated with Ebstein's anomaly, a congenital heart defect, but it is not the most likely cause of the symptoms described.

D. Maternal alcohol consumption is associated with fetal alcohol syndrome, which can cause a range of birth defects, but it is not specifically associated with the symptoms described.

E. Retinoic acid exposure in utero is associated with a range of birth defects, but it is not specifically associated with the symptoms described.",Success
"A 30-year-old African American woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a dry cough and chest discomfort for the past 3 days. During this period, the patient has had headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, fever, and chills. Ten days ago, she was hiking with her family in Mississippi. The patient has asthma that is treated with an albuterol inhaler. Her mother has a lung disease treated with methotrexate. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 10 years. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Physical examination shows slight wheezes throughout both lung fields. Laboratory studies and urinalysis are positive for polysaccharide antigen. Bronchoalveolar lavage using silver/PAS-staining shows macrophages filled with a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is E. Blastomyces dermatitidis infection.

The patient's symptoms, including dry cough, chest discomfort, headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, fever, and chills, are consistent with a fungal infection. The fact that she was hiking in Mississippi 10 days prior to the onset of symptoms suggests exposure to a fungal pathogen endemic to that region. The presence of a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as well as the positive polysaccharide antigen test, support the diagnosis of Blastomyces dermatitidis infection. Blastomyces is a dimorphic fungus that is commonly found in the southeastern United States, including Mississippi, and can cause a range of respiratory symptoms.",Success
"A 62-year-old patient has been hospitalized for a week due to a stroke. One week into the hospitalization, he develops a fever and purulent cough. His vitals include: heart rate 88/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 38.4°C (101.1°F), and blood pressure 110/85 mm Hg. On physical examination, he has basal crackles on the right side of the chest. Chest radiography shows a new consolidation on the same side. Complete blood count is as follows:
Hemoglobin 16 mg/dL
Hematocrit 50%
Leukocyte count 8,900/mm3
Neutrophils 72%
Bands 4%
Eosinophils 2%
Basophils 0%
Lymphocytes 17%
Monocytes 5%
Platelet count 280,000/mm3
What is the most likely causal microorganism?",E,"The correct answer is E. Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The presence of basal crackles on the right side of the chest and a new consolidation on the chest radiograph support this diagnosis. The patient's leukocyte count is slightly elevated, with a left shift (increased bands) indicating an acute inflammatory response.

Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of HAP, particularly in patients who have been hospitalized for an extended period. It is often resistant to multiple antibiotics and can cause severe pneumonia.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Option A) is also a common cause of HAP, but it is more likely to cause a severe, necrotizing pneumonia, which is not described in this scenario.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (Option B) is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, but it is less likely to cause HAP.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Option C) is not typically associated with HAP, and the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest tuberculosis.

Haemophilus influenzae (Option D) is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, but it is less likely to cause HAP.",Success
"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother for worsening wheezing and shortness of breath over the past day. He has not had a fever, cough, vomiting, or diarrhea. He has asthma and eczema. He uses a glucocorticoid inhaler and an albuterol inhaler but has missed his medications for the past week while on vacation. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 100/80. Expiratory and inspiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. There are moderate intercostal and subcostal retractions and a decreased inspiratory to expiratory ratio. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium treatments and intravenous methylprednisolone are given in the emergency department for a presumed asthma exacerbation. One hour later, the child is limp and lethargic. Magnesium sulfate is administered. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 150/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/70. No wheezing is heard on repeat pulmonary examination. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. Intubate with mechanical ventilation.

The patient's symptoms have worsened, and they have become limp and lethargic, indicating respiratory failure. The absence of wheezing on repeat pulmonary examination suggests that the airway obstruction has been relieved, but the patient is now experiencing respiratory depression. The administration of magnesium sulfate, a medication used to treat asthma exacerbations, may have contributed to the respiratory depression. Given the patient's condition, intubation with mechanical ventilation is the most appropriate next step in management to support their respiratory function.",Success
"A 5-year-old female suffers from recurrent infections by Aspergillus species, Pseudomonas species, and Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's neutrophils are examined in the laboratory and they fail to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test. Which of the following is most likely dysfunctional in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Respiratory burst.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent infections with certain bacteria and fungi, including Aspergillus and Staphylococcus aureus.

The nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test is used to diagnose CGD. In this test, neutrophils are incubated with NBT, which is reduced to formazan in the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during the respiratory burst. In normal individuals, the neutrophils reduce NBT, causing them to turn blue. In patients with CGD, the neutrophils fail to reduce NBT, indicating a defect in the respiratory burst.

The respiratory burst is a critical mechanism by which neutrophils generate ROS to kill ingested microorganisms. In CGD, the defect in the respiratory burst leads to impaired microbial killing and recurrent infections.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Lymphocytes are not primarily involved in the defense against Aspergillus and Pseudomonas infections.

B. Immunoglobulin class switching is a process involved in the adaptive immune response and is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

C. Superoxide dismutase is an enzyme that converts superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide, but it is not directly involved in the respiratory burst.

D. Myeloperoxidase is an enzyme involved in the production of hypochlorous acid, which is important for microbial killing, but it is not the primary defect in CGD.",Success
"A 3-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a ‘cough-like-a-seal bark’ and a high-pitched inspiratory noise that is audible without a stethoscope. His mother reports that his cough has worsened over the last few hours. The patient's blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, respiratory rate is 35/min, and temperature is 38.3°C (101.1°F). On physical examination, the boy is sitting and leaning forward in apparent respiratory distress with suprasternal and intercostal retractions. Auscultation reveals inspiratory stridor without wheezing. He has a frequent barking cough and a hoarse voice when he speaks. What is a chest X-ray likely to show?",E,"The correct answer is E. Steeple sign.

The patient's symptoms, such as a ""cough-like-a-seal bark"", high-pitched inspiratory noise, inspiratory stridor, and hoarse voice, are consistent with croup, a viral infection that causes inflammation of the larynx and trachea. The chest X-ray in a patient with croup is likely to show a ""steeple sign"", which is a narrowing of the tracheal air column on the anteroposterior view, due to the inflammation and swelling of the tracheal mucosa.",Success
"A 26-year-old woman presents to a gynecologist after a missed period. After performing a complete physical examination and a screening test for pregnancy, her gynecologist informs her that she is pregnant. She is very surprised as she has been taking oral contraceptives regularly. When the gynecologist asks her about the consumption of any other medications, she mentions that she was placed on treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) 2 months ago. Her current anti-TB regimen includes rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin leading to decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone.

Rifampin, an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis, is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. This enzyme is responsible for metabolizing many drugs, including oral contraceptives. When rifampin induces CYP3A4, it increases the metabolism of ethinylestradiol and progesterone, leading to decreased serum levels of these hormones. As a result, the effectiveness of the oral contraceptive is reduced, increasing the risk of pregnancy.",Success
"A 4-year-old previously healthy boy presents with 4 days of intermittent vomiting and 5-6 daily loose stools. His mother noted bloody stools and decreased oral intake of food and water over the last 24 hours. He is normally in daycare; however, he has been home for the past 3 days. On physical exam his temperature is 102.2°F (39°C), blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min and O2 saturation is 99% on room air. He has dry mucous membranes. On abdominal exam you note diffuse tenderness to palpation without rebound or guarding. There are no masses, hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds are hyperactive. Ultrasound of the right lower quadrant is negative for appendicitis. Stool is guaiac positive. He receives 15mg/kg acetaminophen and fluids are started. The next day, he complains of lower extremity weakness and tingling. On repeat exam, lower extremity strength is 3/5 with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following lab findings would most likely be seen in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a complication of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection. The patient's history of bloody stools, decreased oral intake, and signs of dehydration are all consistent with HUS. The development of lower extremity weakness and tingling on the second day of hospitalization suggests neurological involvement, which is a common complication of HUS.

The lab finding that would most likely be seen in this patient is an increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein with a normal cell count, indicating inflammation and demyelination of the nervous system. This is consistent with the neurological symptoms the patient is experiencing.

The other options are not directly related to HUS or the patient's symptoms:

A. Gram stain positive CSF would indicate bacterial meningitis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

B. Peripheral eosinophilia is more commonly seen in parasitic infections or allergic reactions.

C. Xanthochromia on CSF analysis is indicative of subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

E. Oligoclonal bands on CSF analysis are typically seen in multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating diseases, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.",Success
A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the physician because of an inward turning of his left forefoot. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation by cesarean section because of breech presentation. The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios. Examination shows concavity of the medial border of the left foot with a skin crease just below the ball of the great toe. The lateral border of the left foot is convex. The heel is in neutral position. Tickling the lateral border of the foot leads to correction of the deformity. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the left foot shows an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?,D,"The correct answer is D. Reassurance.

The patient has a diagnosis of metatarsus adductus, a common congenital deformity of the foot. The deformity is characterized by an inward turning of the forefoot, with the medial border of the foot concave and the lateral border convex. The fact that the deformity corrects with tickling the lateral border of the foot suggests that it is a flexible deformity, which is likely to resolve on its own with time.

In this case, the most appropriate next step is reassurance, as the deformity is likely to self-correct without any intervention. The other options are not necessary at this stage, as they are typically reserved for more severe or rigid deformities that do not respond to conservative management.",Success
"A 42-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of right upper abdominal pain and nausea. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 91 kg (200 lb); her BMI is 34 kg/m2. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F). Physical examination shows a distended abdomen and right upper quadrant tenderness with normal bowel sounds. Laboratory studies show:
Leukocyte count 14,000/mm3
Serum
Total bilirubin 1.1 mg/dL
AST 32 U/L
ALT 40 U/L
Alkaline phosphatase 68 U/L
Abdominal ultrasonography is performed, but the results are inconclusive. Cholescintigraphy shows the intrahepatic bile ducts, hepatic ducts, common bile duct, and proximal small bowel. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?""",E,"The correct answer is B. Hypomotility of the gallbladder.

The patient's symptoms, including right upper abdominal pain and nausea, are consistent with a gallbladder-related issue. The laboratory studies show a mild elevation in alkaline phosphatase, which suggests a possible biliary issue. The cholescintigraphy results, which show the intrahepatic bile ducts, hepatic ducts, common bile duct, and proximal small bowel, indicate that the bile is flowing freely into the small intestine, which makes obstruction of the cystic duct (option E) unlikely.

The patient's obesity (BMI 34 kg/m2) and lack of evidence of pancreatitis (normal AST and ALT levels) make hypomotility of the gallbladder (option B) a more likely cause of her symptoms. Hypomotility can lead to stasis of bile in the gallbladder, which can cause inflammation and infection, resulting in the patient's symptoms.

Autodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma (option A) is not supported by the laboratory results, which show normal AST and ALT levels. A fistula between the gallbladder and small intestine (option C) would likely cause more severe symptoms and would be visible on imaging studies. Infection with a hepatotropic virus (option D) is not supported by the laboratory results, which do not show any evidence of hepatitis.",Success
A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the intensive care unit for shortness of breath and palpitations. A cardiac catheterization is performed and measurements of the left ventricular volume and pressure at different points in the cardiac cycle are obtained. The patient's pressure-volume loop (gray) is shown with a normal pressure-volume loop (black) for comparison. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?,C,"The correct answer is C. Increased ventricular wall stiffness.

The pressure-volume loop shown in the question indicates that the patient's left ventricle is operating at a higher pressure for any given volume compared to a normal heart. This is consistent with increased ventricular wall stiffness, which can lead to diastolic dysfunction and symptoms such as shortness of breath and palpitations.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Mitral valve regurgitation would lead to an increase in left ventricular volume, but the pressure-volume loop would not be shifted upwards.

B. Increased systemic vascular resistance would lead to an increase in left ventricular pressure, but the pressure-volume loop would be shifted to the right, not upwards.

D. Impaired left ventricular contractility would lead to a decrease in left ventricular pressure and a shift of the pressure-volume loop to the right.

E. Aortic stenosis would lead to an increase in left ventricular pressure, but the pressure-volume loop would be shifted to the right, not upwards.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is increased ventricular wall stiffness.",Success

Blood cultures grow coagulase-negative staphylococci. The patient was most likely treated with which of the following antibiotics?",E,"The correct answer is E. Chloramphenicol.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of pancytopenia, which is a known side effect of chloramphenicol therapy. Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic that is sometimes used to treat bacterial meningitis, especially in areas where there is a high prevalence of penicillin-resistant strains. The patient's history of being hospitalized for bacterial meningitis in Guatemala, where chloramphenicol is commonly used, supports this diagnosis.",Success
"An otherwise healthy 50-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss during this time. Physical examination shows bilateral pitting pedal edema. An endoscopy shows prominent rugae in the gastric fundus. Biopsy shows parietal cell atrophy. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause?",B,"The correct answer is E. Ectopic secretion of gastrin.

The patient's symptoms, including upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are consistent with gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), which is a condition characterized by excessive secretion of gastrin, usually from a pancreatic tumor. The endoscopic finding of prominent rugae in the gastric fundus and the biopsy result of parietal cell atrophy support this diagnosis. The bilateral pitting pedal edema suggests that the patient may have hypokalemia, which is a common complication of gastrinoma.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and endoscopic findings:

A. Serotonin-secreting gastric tumor would not typically cause parietal cell atrophy.

B. Proliferation of gastric mucus-producing cells would not cause the symptoms described.

C. Neoplasia of submucosal lymphoid tissue (lymphoma) would not typically cause parietal cell atrophy.

D. Excessive somatostatin secretion would not cause the symptoms described and would not typically cause parietal cell atrophy.",Success

Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 19 mEq/L

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is E. Supportive therapy and close monitoring.

The patient presented with severe hyperkalemia (K+ 6.3 mEq/L) and hyperglycemia (glucose 589 mg/dL), which are indicative of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The treatment given likely included insulin, which corrected the hyperglycemia and hyperkalemia. The patient's vital signs and laboratory values have improved significantly after treatment.

At this point, the patient does not require further active treatment for DKA. The best next step is to provide supportive therapy, including close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values, to ensure that the patient does not relapse into DKA. The patient may also require further evaluation and management of their underlying diabetes and substance abuse.

Options A, B, and C are not necessary, as the patient's hyperglycemia and hyperkalemia have already been corrected. Option D, oral rehydration, is not sufficient, as the patient requires close monitoring and supportive therapy in a hospital setting.",Success

He also has back pain which makes it extremely difficult to move around and be active during the day. He says his pain significantly improves with rest. He also suffers from dandruff for which he uses special shampoos. Physical examination is notable for pitting of his nails. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Psoriatic arthritis.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with psoriatic arthritis:

* The patient has a history of arthritis, which is a common feature of psoriatic arthritis.
* The patient has dandruff, which is a symptom of psoriasis, a skin condition that is often associated with psoriatic arthritis.
* The patient has pitting of his nails, which is a characteristic feature of psoriatic arthritis.
* The patient's pain improves with rest, which is consistent with the pattern of pain seen in psoriatic arthritis.
* The patient has involvement of multiple joints, including the knees and back, which is consistent with the polyarticular pattern of psoriatic arthritis.

Arthritis mutilans (option B) is a rare and severe form of psoriatic arthritis that is characterized by significant joint destruction and deformity. While the patient's symptoms are consistent with psoriatic arthritis, they do not suggest the severe joint destruction seen in arthritis mutilans.

Rheumatoid arthritis (option C) is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with psoriatic arthritis.

Familial Mediterranean fever (option D) is a genetic disorder that is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, abdominal pain, and joint pain. It is not a likely diagnosis in this case.

A 65-year-old woman schedules an appointment with her physician for evaluation of weight loss and weakness. The weakness is more noticeable when climbing stairs and combing hair. The weakness improves after brief exercise. She also has bladder incontinence for the past 4 weeks and was given an anticholinesterase agent with no improvement. What is the most likely cause of the symptoms?,E,"The correct answer is D. Myasthenia gravis.

The symptoms described, such as weakness that improves after brief rest, are classic features of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction. The weakness in climbing stairs and combing hair suggests involvement of proximal muscles, which is common in myasthenia gravis. The lack of improvement with anticholinesterase agents, which are typically used to treat myasthenia gravis, may be due to the fact that the patient has a more advanced or severe form of the disease.

Botulism (A) typically presents with descending paralysis, starting with cranial nerves and progressing to peripheral muscles, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (B) is a genetic disorder that typically presents in childhood and is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting. Hypothyroidism (C) can cause muscle weakness, but it is not typically associated with the specific pattern of weakness described in the question.

"A 3-month-old boy presents to his pediatrician with persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, and signs and symptoms suggestive of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia. His weight is in the 10th percentile. He is being evaluated for an immunodeficiency disease. Laboratory results for the HIV are negative by PCR. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Defective T cell function.

The patient's symptoms, such as persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, and RSV pneumonia, are consistent with a T-cell deficiency. The fact that the HIV PCR is negative suggests that the patient does not have HIV, but rather a primary immunodeficiency disease.

Defective T cell function is a hallmark of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which is a primary immunodeficiency disease that affects both T cells and B cells. SCID is characterized by a lack of functional T cells, which leads to recurrent infections, including opportunistic infections such as candidiasis.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms:

10 mg dose - 6/59 patients demonstrated improvement
20 mg dose - 19/49 patients demonstrated improvement
30 mg dose - 26/53 patients demonstrated improvement
40 mg dose - 46/51 patients demonstrated improvement

40 mg dose - 11/51 patients had a treatment related adverse event
60 mg dose - 15/42 patients had a treatment related adverse event
80 mg dose - 23/47 patients had a treatment related adverse event
100 mg dose - 47/52 patients had a treatment related adverse event

Based on this study, which of the following represents the most likely therapeutic index for this novel chemotherapeutic agent?",E,"The correct answer is B. 0.5.

The therapeutic index is a measure of the safety of a drug, and it is calculated as the ratio of the dose that produces a toxic effect to the dose that produces a therapeutic effect.

From the data, we can see that the 40 mg dose produces a therapeutic effect in 46/51 patients, and a toxic effect in 11/51 patients. Therefore, the therapeutic index can be calculated as:

Therapeutic index = Dose that produces a toxic effect / Dose that produces a therapeutic effect
= 40 mg (toxic effect) / 40 mg (therapeutic effect)
= 0.5

This means that the dose that produces a toxic effect is half the dose that produces a therapeutic effect, indicating a relatively narrow therapeutic index.",Success

Subsequent neurologic exam finds that the patient is fluent while speaking and is able to comprehend both one and two step instructions. Noticeably the patient remains unable to complete tasks involving verbal repetition. Residual damage to which of the following structures is most likely responsible for this patient's syndrome?",A,"The correct answer is A. Arcuate fasciculus.

The patient's symptoms, specifically the inability to repeat verbal phrases despite being fluent and able to comprehend instructions, are consistent with conduction aphasia. Conduction aphasia is typically associated with damage to the arcuate fasciculus, a bundle of fibers that connects the Wernicke's area (responsible for language comprehension) and Broca's area (responsible for language production).

The other options are not correct because:

* B. Inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) is involved in language production, and damage to this area would result in expressive aphasia, characterized by difficulty speaking in grammatically correct sentences.
* C. Superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) is involved in language comprehension, and damage to this area would result in receptive aphasia, characterized by difficulty understanding spoken language.
* D. Inferior frontal gyrus + superior temporal gyrus would result in a combination of expressive and receptive aphasia, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.
* E. Arcuate fasciculus + inferior frontal gyrus + superior temporal gyrus would result in a more global language impairment, which is not consistent with the patient's relatively preserved language abilities except for verbal repetition.",Success

Fasting 141 mg/ dL
2 hours Post-Prandial 235 mg/ dL
HbA1c 8.1%
Which of the following is the best measure to prevent the progression of the symptoms present in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Strict blood glucose control.

The patient's symptoms of tingling and numbness in the lower limbs, along with decreased sensation to pain, suggest peripheral neuropathy, which is a common complication of diabetes. The patient's inconsistent management of his diabetes and elevated HbA1c level (8.1%) indicate poor glycemic control.

Strict blood glucose control is the best measure to prevent the progression of peripheral neuropathy symptoms in this patient. This can be achieved through a combination of lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, and medication adjustments, including increasing the dose of metformin and/or adding other glucose-lowering agents.

The other options are not directly related to preventing the progression of peripheral neuropathy symptoms:

A. Atorvastatin is a statin used to manage high cholesterol, which is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

B. Femoro-Ileal artery bypass is a surgical procedure used to treat peripheral artery disease, which is not indicated in this patient based on the provided information.

D. Strict control of blood pressure is important for overall cardiovascular health, but it is not the primary measure to prevent the progression of peripheral neuropathy symptoms.

E. Lower limb amputation is not a relevant option for this patient, as there is no indication of severe peripheral artery disease or gangrene.",Success
"A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient’s two older siblings are both healthy. The patient’s temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 58/37 mmHg, pulse is 166/min, and respirations are 38/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress. His abdomen is firm and distended with hypoactive bowel sounds.

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this fetus’s presentation?",A,"The correct answer is A. Duodenal atresia.

The patient's presentation with bilious vomiting, failure to pass meconium, and a firm and distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds suggests a high intestinal obstruction. The prenatal ultrasound finding of an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm, which is elevated, also supports this diagnosis. The quadruple screen results, which showed decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A, are consistent with a diagnosis of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), which is often associated with duodenal atresia.

Duodenal atresia is a congenital anomaly that occurs when the duodenum fails to develop properly, resulting in a blockage of the small intestine. It is a common cause of intestinal obstruction in newborns and is often associated with other congenital anomalies, such as trisomy 21.

The other options are less likely:

B. Intestinal malrotation is a possible cause of intestinal obstruction, but it is less likely to present with bilious vomiting and a firm and distended abdomen.

C. Meconium ileus is a condition that occurs when the meconium in the intestine becomes thick and sticky, causing a blockage. It is often associated with cystic fibrosis, but it is less likely to present with bilious vomiting.

D. Necrotizing enterocolitis is a condition that occurs when the intestine becomes inflamed and damaged, often in premature infants. It is less likely to present with bilious vomiting and a firm and distended abdomen.

E. Pyloric stenosis is a condition that occurs when the pylorus muscle becomes thickened, causing a blockage of the stomach. It typically presents with non-bilious vomiting and is less likely to present with a firm and distended abdomen.",Success
"A healthy 23-year-old male is undergoing an exercise stress test as part of his physiology class. If blood were to be sampled at different locations before and after the stress test, which area of the body would contain the lowest oxygen content at both time points?",C,"The correct answer is C. Coronary sinus.

The coronary sinus is a vein that drains deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle itself. It has the lowest oxygen content because it carries blood that has already passed through the heart's capillaries and has released its oxygen to the heart muscle.

The superior and inferior vena cavae (options A and B) also carry deoxygenated blood, but they drain blood from the upper and lower body, respectively, and have slightly higher oxygen content than the coronary sinus.

The pulmonary artery (option D) carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs, where it will pick up oxygen and release carbon dioxide. While it has low oxygen content, it is not the lowest.

The pulmonary vein (option E) carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart, so it has a high oxygen content.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C, the coronary sinus.",Success
"A 45-year-old G5P4105 presents to her gynecologist’s office with six months of increasingly heavy periods. She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle.

"A man is brought into the emergency department by the police department. The officer state that the man has been arrested multiple times for public alcohol intoxication, but recently became homeless. On exam, the man is behaving erratically. His vitals are all within normal limits. He appears confused and has a slurred speech. On gait exam, the patient is ataxic and cannot stand without support for more than a few seconds. Labs return with the following values: Na 140, K 4, Cl 106, BUN 8, Cr 2. His ABG has pH 7.3, PaCO2 13mm, PaO2 130mm, HCO3 7. His urinalysis is shown in Figure 1. Blood salicylate levels return as normal. While you await other diagnostic tests, which of the following should be administered next to treat this patient?",E,"The correct answer is A. Ethanol.

The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a diagnosis of ethanol withdrawal, particularly Wernicke's encephalopathy. The patient's erratic behavior, confusion, slurred speech, and ataxia are consistent with this diagnosis. The low bicarbonate level and high anion gap on the ABG suggest a metabolic acidosis, which is also consistent with ethanol withdrawal.

The urinalysis result showing a high specific gravity and ketones further supports this diagnosis, as it suggests dehydration and ketoacidosis, which are common complications of ethanol withdrawal.

Ethanol is the treatment of choice for Wernicke's encephalopathy, as it helps to replenish thiamine stores and alleviate symptoms. The other options are not indicated for this diagnosis:

* Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist used to treat opioid dependence, but it is not relevant to this patient's condition.
* Naloxone is also an opioid antagonist, but it is used to treat opioid overdose, not ethanol withdrawal.
* Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist used to treat benzodiazepine overdose, but it is not relevant to this patient's condition.
* Fomepizole is an antidote used to treat methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning, but it is not indicated for ethanol withdrawal.",Success
"A medical research study is evaluating an investigational novel drug (medication 1) compared with standard therapy (medication 2) in patients presenting to the emergency department with myocardial infarction (MI). The study enrolled a total of 3,000 subjects, 1,500 in each study arm. Follow-up was conducted at 45 days post-MI. The following are the results of the trial:
Endpoints Medication 1 Medication 2 P-Value
Primary: death from cardiac causes 134 210 0.03
Secondary: hyperkalemia 57 70 0.4
What is the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes? (Round to the nearest whole number.)",C,"To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), we need to first calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR).

The control event rate (CER) is the number of events in the control group (Medication 2) divided by the total number of subjects in the control group:

CER = 210 / 1500 = 0.14

The experimental event rate (EER) is the number of events in the treatment group (Medication 1) divided by the total number of subjects in the treatment group:

EER = 134 / 1500 = 0.089

The absolute risk reduction (ARR) is the difference between the control event rate and the experimental event rate:

ARR = CER - EER = 0.14 - 0.089 = 0.051

The number needed to treat (NNT) is the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction:

NNT = 1 / ARR = 1 / 0.051 ≈ 19.6

"A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level during exercises. He reports that he started exercising regularly 2 months ago and that his right calf cramps when he uses the incline feature on the treadmill, forcing him to take frequent breaks. The pain completely disappears after resting for a few minutes. He has an 8-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 34 years. His only medication is metformin. His pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 170/92 mm Hg. Straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot. There is no pain in the back. His muscle strength is normal. Femoral pulses are palpable; right pedal pulses are absent. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Femoropopliteal artery stenosis.

The patient's symptoms, such as tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level, calf cramps, and pain relief after resting, are consistent with intermittent claudication, which is a classic symptom of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The absence of right pedal pulses and the presence of femoral pulses suggest that the blockage is in the femoropopliteal segment, which is the artery that runs from the femoral artery to the popliteal artery. This is consistent with femoropopliteal artery stenosis.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

* B. Vasculitis of the right popliteal artery is unlikely, as there is no mention of systemic symptoms or signs of inflammation.
* C. Acute thrombosis of right popliteal vein would present with sudden onset of pain, swelling, and warmth in the affected leg, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.
* D. Lumbar spinal stenosis would typically cause back pain, which is not present in this patient.
* E. Aortoiliac artery stenosis would likely cause symptoms in both legs, rather than just one leg.",Success
"A 29-year-old primigravid woman at 35 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in labor. She has no history of serious medical illness. She has had an uncomplicated pregnancy.

Ultrasound shows decreased amniotic fluid levels and no evidence of fetal movement, respiration, or heart activity. The patient gives birth to a 2296 g (5 lb 1 oz) male infant. Physical examination shows no signs of life. There are no visible malformations. The placenta is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Recommend autopsy of the infant.

The scenario describes a stillbirth, and the most appropriate next step in management is to recommend an autopsy of the infant to determine the cause of death. An autopsy can provide valuable information about the underlying cause of the stillbirth, which can help the healthcare team counsel the parents about the risk of recurrence in future pregnancies.",Success
"A 67-year-old man is hospitalized after several days of fever and increasing shortness of breath. Respiratory viral panel returns positive for influenza A and the patient is started on a standard five day course of oseltamivir. Despite therapy, his shortness of breath continues to worsen and his oxygen saturation decreases to the point where ICU transfer and intubation are required. Chest radiograph shows bilateral infiltrates. Clinical criteria are consistent with development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). After several weeks of supportive therapy, the patient improves with lung function returning to near normal. Which of the following processes is involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining after damage to alveoli occurs?",D,"The correct answer is D. Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells.

After alveolar damage, the regeneration of the alveolar lining involves the proliferation of type II pneumocytes, which are surfactant-secreting cells. These cells differentiate into type I pneumocytes, which are the primary cells lining the alveoli, and restore the integrity of the alveolar epithelium.

The other options are not directly involved in the regeneration of the alveolar lining:

A. Squamous cell proliferation is not a normal process in the alveoli.

B. Ciliated cells are involved in mucociliary clearance, but they do not play a direct role in alveolar regeneration.

C. Excess mucus production by goblet cells is not a mechanism of alveolar regeneration.

E. Club cells are involved in the production of surfactant, but they are not the primary cells involved in alveolar regeneration.",Success
A 65-year-old male is treated for anal carcinoma with therapy including external beam radiation. How does radiation affect cancer cells?,E,"The correct answer is E. Induces breaks in double-stranded DNA.

Radiation therapy, including external beam radiation, works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, ultimately leading to their death. One of the primary mechanisms by which radiation damages DNA is by inducing breaks in double-stranded DNA. This can occur through the formation of free radicals, which can interact with DNA and cause strand breaks. As a result, the cancer cell's ability to replicate and divide is disrupted, leading to cell death.

The other options are not directly related to the effects of radiation on cancer cells:

A. Thymidine dimers are a type of DNA lesion that can occur as a result of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, not external beam radiation.

B. Disulfide bonds are a type of covalent bond that can form between two cysteine residues in proteins, but they are not directly related to the effects of radiation on DNA.

C. G/T and A/C pair formation is not a known effect of radiation on DNA.

D. Deamination of cytosine is a type of DNA damage that can occur through other mechanisms, such as spontaneous deamination or enzymatic deamination, but it is not a direct result of radiation therapy.",Success
"A 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to his physician with progressive fatigue and new onset muscle cramps. He has had no recent changes to his medication regimen, which includes hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and amlodipine.

Serum:
Na+: 138 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 3.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 33 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 129 mg/dL

What is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension?",A,"The correct answer is A. Aldosterone excess.

The patient's laboratory values suggest hypokalemia (low potassium levels) and metabolic alkalosis (high bicarbonate levels), which are consistent with aldosterone excess. Aldosterone is a hormone that regulates electrolyte balance and blood pressure. Excess aldosterone can cause potassium depletion and metabolic alkalosis, leading to symptoms such as muscle cramps and fatigue.

The other options are not supported by the laboratory values:

B. Catecholamine-secreting mass would likely cause tachycardia and hypertension, but would not explain the hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

C. Cortisol excess would likely cause hyperglycemia, but would not explain the hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

D. Impaired kidney perfusion would likely cause azotemia (elevated BUN and creatinine levels), but would not explain the hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

E. Increased peripheral vascular resistance would likely cause hypertension, but would not explain the hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

Therefore, the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension is aldosterone excess.",Success
A 65-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of yellowish discoloration of his skin and generalized pruritus. Examination shows jaundice of the skin and scleral icterus. Urinalysis shows an elevated concentration of bilirubin and a low concentration of urobilinogen. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?,D,"The correct answer is D. Defective hepatic bile excretion.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with obstructive jaundice, which is caused by a blockage in the bile ducts that prevents bile from flowing into the intestine. The elevated concentration of bilirubin in the urine and the low concentration of urobilinogen suggest that bilirubin is not being excreted into the bile, but rather is being excreted into the urine.

Option D, Defective hepatic bile excretion, is the most likely underlying cause of these findings. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as a tumor, gallstones, or inflammation that is blocking the bile ducts.

Option A, Absent UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity, is a genetic disorder that affects bilirubin metabolism, but it would not cause obstructive jaundice.

Option B, Increased hemoglobin breakdown, would increase bilirubin production, but it would not cause a blockage in the bile ducts.

Option C, Increased intestinal bilirubin reabsorption, would increase bilirubin levels in the blood, but it would not cause obstructive jaundice.

Option E, Presence of stones within the gallbladder, could cause obstructive jaundice, but it is not the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.",Success

Two weeks later, the patient develops vomiting, mild crampy abdominal pain, and watery, nonbloody diarrhea. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",D,"The correct answer is A. Bethanechol.

Galantamine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is used to treat Alzheimer's disease. The side effects the patient is experiencing, such as vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, are likely due to the increased cholinergic activity caused by the medication. Bethanechol, a cholinergic agonist, can help alleviate these gastrointestinal symptoms by increasing gut motility and promoting bowel movements.",Success

He resides in an inpatient psychiatric facility where he has been successfully treated with haloperidol for the past several months. His physical exam and vitals are within normal limits. Which of the following accurately describes his symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Tardive dyskinesia.

The symptoms described, such as the smacking motion with his lips, pursing his mouth, and blinking excessively, are classic signs of tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesia is a movement disorder that can occur as a side effect of long-term use of antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol. It is characterized by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, lips, and jaw, and can also affect other parts of the body.

Physical examination reveals an erythematous, well-demarcated patch with peripheral scale on the left thigh, pubic region, and perineum. There is no apparent scrotal involvement with the rash. How can you confirm the suspected diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. KOH examination of lesion scrapings.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with tinea cruris, a fungal infection of the groin area. The KOH (potassium hydroxide) examination is a diagnostic test used to confirm the presence of fungal elements in skin scrapings. It involves scraping the affected area, mixing the scrapings with KOH, and examining the mixture under a microscope for fungal hyphae or spores. This test is commonly used to diagnose fungal infections such as tinea cruris, tinea pedis, and tinea corporis.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Localized ultrasound is not a diagnostic test for fungal infections.

C. Nikolsky's sign is a physical examination finding seen in conditions such as pemphigus, where gentle pressure on the skin causes the top layer of skin to separate from the underlying layers. It is not relevant to the diagnosis of tinea cruris.

Her blood pressure is 95/80 mm Hg and her temperature is 40.0°C (104.0°F). On physical examination, the patient appears diaphoretic. A pelvic examination reveals a tampon in her vagina. Binding and activation of which of the following T cell receptors is responsible for this patient’s most likely condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Variable β-sequence of the T cell receptor.

The patient's symptoms, including fever, altered mental status, petechial rash, nausea, and vomiting, are consistent with toxic shock syndrome (TSS). TSS is a life-threatening medical condition caused by bacterial toxins, often produced by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. In this case, the presence of a tampon in the vagina suggests that the patient has menstrual TSS, which is often associated with Staphylococcus aureus.

The variable β-sequence of the T cell receptor is involved in the binding and activation of T cells in response to superantigens, such as the toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) produced by Staphylococcus aureus. Superantigens are able to bind directly to the variable β-sequence of the T cell receptor, bypassing the normal antigen presentation process and leading to a massive activation of T cells and the release of cytokines, which contributes to the development of TSS.",Success

"A 22-year-old female college student is treated with metronidazole after presenting to student health services with itching, discharge, and pain in her vagina. At a party shortly afterward she experiences facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps after consuming alcohol. Serum levels of which of the following are likely elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption:",A,"The correct answer is A. Acetaldehyde.

Metronidazole is an antibiotic that can cause a disulfiram-like reaction when combined with alcohol. Disulfiram, a medication used to treat alcoholism, works by inhibiting the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is responsible for breaking down acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of alcohol. When acetaldehyde accumulates in the body, it can cause a range of symptoms including facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps, which are similar to those experienced by the patient in this scenario.

Therefore, serum levels of acetaldehyde are likely elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption.",Success

Which of the following tests is required to investigate the cause of the patient’s laboratory findings?",D,"The correct answer is A. Serum iron level.

The patient's laboratory results show a low hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11.1 g/dL, which indicates anemia. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is 90 fL, which is normal. The reticulocyte count is 0.2%, which is low. These findings suggest iron deficiency anemia, which is common in pregnancy.

To investigate the cause of the anemia, a serum iron level test is required to confirm iron deficiency. This test will help determine if the patient's anemia is due to iron deficiency or another cause.

The other options are not correct because:

* Serum B12 level (Option B) is not relevant to the patient's anemia, as the MCV is normal, which suggests that vitamin B12 deficiency is unlikely.
* Transferrin (Option C) is a protein that binds to iron in the blood, but it is not a direct measure of iron levels.

"An 80-year-old man is transferred from a step-down unit to a med-surg floor in the hospital. He had undergone a successful hernia surgery 14 hours ago. Before the surgery, he was pre-treated with atropine, scopolamine, and morphine and recovered well in the PACU after the surgery. There were no complications in the step-down unit and the patient continued to recover. On the med-surg floor, his temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), the heart rate is 98/min, the respiratory rate is 15/min, the blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg, the oxygen saturation is 90%. On physical exam, he is a well-developed, obese man. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His incision site is clean, dry, and intact with an appropriate level of swelling and erythema. During the physical, the patient mentions some discomfort in his abdomen and pelvis and during a records review it is noted that he has not passed urine in the PACU, step-down unit, or since arriving on the med-surg floor. A bladder scan is inconclusive due to body habitus. What is the next best step in the treatment of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Insert a ‘straight cath’ into the patient’s bladder.

The patient has not passed urine since the surgery, which suggests urinary retention. The bladder scan was inconclusive due to the patient's obesity, making it difficult to assess the bladder volume. Inserting a straight catheter (also known as an in-and-out catheter) into the patient's bladder is the next best step to drain the bladder and relieve any potential urinary retention. This is a common complication after surgery, especially in older adults, and can be caused by the anesthesia, pain medication, or surgical trauma.",Success
"A healthy 19-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of painless “blisters” in his mouth. He reports that he noticed a white film on his tongue and the sides of his mouth 2 days ago while brushing his teeth. The film was easily brushed off. He also complains of a bitter metallic taste in his mouth but otherwise denies pain, burning, dysphagia, or hoarseness. He is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. He is a competitive swimmer and has had 8 sexual partners in the past year. He intermittently uses barrier protection. On exam, he is well-appearing and in no acute distress. His oral examination demonstrates patches of white pseudomembranes that can be wiped away to reveal erythematous mucosa. A medication with which of the following mechanisms of action is most appropriate in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is C. Inhibition of 14-alpha-demethylase.

The patient's symptoms and examination are consistent with oral thrush, a fungal infection caused by Candida albicans. The white patches on the tongue and sides of the mouth that can be wiped away to reveal erythematous mucosa are characteristic of oral thrush.

The mechanism of action of the medication that is most appropriate for this patient is inhibition of 14-alpha-demethylase, which is the mechanism of action of azole antifungals such as fluconazole. Azole antifungals work by inhibiting the enzyme 14-alpha-demethylase, which is necessary for the production of ergosterol, a critical component of the fungal cell membrane. Without ergosterol, the fungal cell membrane becomes permeable, leading to the death of the fungal cells.",Success
"A 56-year-old man presents to the clinic complaining of subacute back pain for the past month. The pain is described as a dull, constant ache that is worse at night. He could not recall any precipitating event except for an amateur weight-lifting competition that he participated in 2 months ago. Past medical history is significant for non-small cell lung cancer that was diagnosed and successfully treated. A PET scan 1 year ago demonstrated no recurrence. Physical exam was unremarkable except for some point tenderness along the lumbosacral area. What is the most likely imaging finding in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine.

The patient's history of non-small cell lung cancer and the development of back pain, especially at night, suggests the possibility of metastatic disease to the spine. The point tenderness along the lumbosacral area on physical exam also supports this diagnosis. Lytic lesions, which are areas of bone destruction, are a common finding in metastatic bone disease.",Success
A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of severe abdominal pain and bilious vomiting for 6 hours. He has not had bowel movements in the past 24 hours. He appears ill. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F) and pulse is 122/min. Examination shows a distended abdomen. There is tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen; guarding and rebound tenderness are present. Bowel sounds are decreased. An x-ray of the abdomen shows dilated loops of bowel. He has been accompanied by his 14-year-old brother. The surgeon recommends an emergency laparotomy. The parents are away visiting friends and cannot be reached. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?,D,"The correct answer is D. Perform emergency laparotomy.

In this scenario, the child's life is in danger due to a potential surgical emergency, and delaying treatment could lead to serious harm or even death. The surgeon has recommended an emergency laparotomy, and it is essential to act quickly.

While it is ideal to obtain informed consent from the parents, it is not possible in this situation since they are unreachable. However, the doctrine of ""implied consent"" applies in emergency situations where a patient's life is at risk, and a reasonable person would consent to treatment if they were able to do so.

Getting consent from the 14-year-old brother (Option A) or the 4-year-old patient himself (Option B) is not appropriate, as they are not legally authorized to provide informed consent. Obtaining a court order (Option C) would take too much time and is not necessary in this emergency situation. Delaying surgery until parental consent is obtained (Option E) is also not an option, as it could lead to further harm or death.",Success
"A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the hospital because of poor weight gain since birth. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation via normal vaginal delivery. He weighed 3005 g (6 lb, 10 oz) at birth and currently weighs 2835 g (6 lb, 4 oz). He has been latching on and breastfeeding well since birth. His mother has a history of Graves' disease and underwent near-total thyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy after her symptoms could not be controlled with antithyroid drugs. She is currently receiving L-thyroxine therapy. The patient's temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 176/min, and respirations are 42/min. He appears irritable. Examination shows a diaphoretic infant with a paucity of subcutaneous fat. There is swelling of the neck at the midline. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",C,"The correct answer is C. Transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies.

The symptoms described in the newborn, such as poor weight gain, irritability, diaphoresis, and a paucity of subcutaneous fat, are consistent with neonatal thyrotoxicosis. The mother's history of Graves' disease and near-total thyroidectomy during pregnancy suggests that she may have had high levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibodies, which can cross the placenta and stimulate the fetal thyroid gland, leading to thyrotoxicosis in the newborn.

Option A, transplacental passage of thyroglobulin antibodies, is not typically associated with neonatal thyrotoxicosis. Option B, transplacental passage of thyroid peroxidase antibodies, is more commonly associated with maternal hypothyroidism and fetal hypothyroidism. Option D, transplacental viral infection, is not supported by the symptoms described. Option E, opiate use in the mother, is not related to the symptoms described and is not a likely cause of neonatal thyrotoxicosis.",Success

On physical examination, she has splenomegaly and a positive fluid wave. The remainder of her examination is within normal limits. The patient is stabilized with intravenous fluids, and her blood pressure improves. Subsequent emergent upper endoscopy reveals bleeding from the submucosal veins in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus, but no gastric bleed. In the endoscopy suite she also receives IV octreotide. After intervention and resolution of her acute bleed, which of the following pharmacologic agents is indicated?",D,"The correct answer is D. Nadolol.

The patient's symptoms and endoscopy results suggest that she has esophageal varices, which are a complication of portal hypertension often seen in patients with liver cirrhosis. The presence of splenomegaly and a positive fluid wave on physical examination also support this diagnosis.

Nadolol is a non-selective beta blocker that is commonly used to prevent variceal bleeding in patients with portal hypertension. It works by reducing portal pressure and decreasing the risk of bleeding.

The other options are not indicated for this patient:

A. Phentolamine is an alpha-adrenergic blocker used to treat hypertension and pheochromocytoma.

B. Prazosin is an alpha-adrenergic blocker used to treat hypertension and benign prostatic hyperplasia.

An abdominal ultrasound shows surface nodularity compatible with cirrhosis but no other changes aside from ascites. An upper GI endoscopy is performed which shows gastric varices with no signs of active bleeding. An MRI of the brain is insignificant. What is the most likely precipitating factor that led to this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

The patient's presentation with altered mental status, asterixis, and hyperreflexia suggests hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver cirrhosis. The elevated ammonia level (100 µg/dL) also supports this diagnosis. The presence of ascites and gastric varices on ultrasound and endoscopy, respectively, are consistent with portal hypertension and cirrhosis.

The patient's fever (38.0°C) and abdominal distension suggest an underlying infection, which is likely spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). SBP is a common complication of cirrhotic ascites and can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy.

The other options are not supported by the patient's presentation and laboratory findings:

* Metabolic alkalosis (option B) is not a likely precipitating factor, as the patient's pH and bicarbonate levels are within normal limits.
* Variceal gastrointestinal bleeding (option C) is not supported by the endoscopy findings, which show no signs of active bleeding.

The patient is given 2 liters of Ringer lactate solution and morphine. Initial workup demonstrates that the patient’s pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and troponins are elevated. The patient is currently complaining of chest pain. Physical exam is notable for an uncomfortable young man with bruising over his chest wall. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Cardiac contusion.

The patient's symptoms and test results are consistent with a cardiac contusion, which is a bruise of the heart muscle. The elevated troponins indicate cardiac damage, and the elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure suggests increased pressure in the heart. The patient's chest pain and bruising over the chest wall also support this diagnosis.

Cardiac contusion is a common injury in motor vehicle collisions, especially when the driver is unrestrained. It can cause damage to the heart muscle, leading to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and arrhythmias.

The other options are not as likely based on the information provided:

B. Hemorrhage is possible, but the patient's blood pressure is not significantly low, and there is no mention of significant bleeding.

C. Myocardial infarction (heart attack) is possible, but the patient's ECG only shows sinus tachycardia, and there is no mention of ST-segment elevation or other signs of a heart attack.

He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications. Which of the following will be the best treatment option for this patient?",C,"The correct answer is A. Adding dopamine to his treatment regimen.

The patient is experiencing oliguria (decreased urine output) in the setting of constant fluid intake, which suggests that he may be developing hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). HRS is a complication of cirrhosis characterized by renal failure and oliguria. The patient's laboratory results, including a low urine sodium level and lack of protein or blood in the urine, are consistent with HRS.

Dopamine is a medication that can help improve renal perfusion and increase urine output in patients with HRS. It is often used in combination with albumin to help manage HRS.

The other options are not correct because:

* B. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor that is contraindicated in patients with cirrhosis and HRS, as it can worsen renal function.
* C. Liver transplantation is not a treatment for HRS, and the patient's condition is not yet severe enough to warrant transplantation.
* D. Switching cefotaxime to ceftriaxone is not relevant to the patient's oliguria and HRS.

She also exhibits a fine tremor in her hands when her arms are outstretched. The urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the best single treatment option for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Methimazole.

The patient's symptoms, such as unintentional weight loss, feeling warm, and a fine tremor, are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The physical exam findings of warm and moist skin, and a heart rate of 110/min, also support this diagnosis.

Methimazole is an antithyroid medication that is commonly used as a first-line treatment for hyperthyroidism. It works by reducing the production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland.

Glucocorticoids (Option A) are not typically used to treat hyperthyroidism. Propranolol (Option C) is a beta blocker that may be used to control symptoms such as tremors and tachycardia, but it does not address the underlying hyperthyroidism. Radioiodine therapy (Option D) and thyroidectomy (Option E) are both used to treat hyperthyroidism, but they are typically reserved for patients who do not respond to antithyroid medications or who have a large goiter.

One month ago, his hemoglobin A1C was 7.8%. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Potassium hydroxide preparation.

The patient's symptoms and rash are consistent with tinea versicolor, a fungal infection of the skin. The potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation is a diagnostic test that can confirm the presence of fungal elements in the skin. It involves scraping the skin lesion and mixing the scrapings with potassium hydroxide, which helps to dissolve the keratin protein and allows the fungal elements to be visualized under a microscope.

A Wood lamp examination (Option A) is used to diagnose certain skin conditions, such as vitiligo or erythrasma, but it is not typically used to diagnose tinea versicolor.

Skin culture (Option B) may be used to diagnose bacterial or fungal infections, but it is not the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis of tinea versicolor.

Skin biopsy (Option D) is an invasive procedure that may be used to diagnose skin conditions, but it is not necessary to diagnose tinea versicolor.

The newborn is then taken for a atrial septostomy to alleviate the condition pending definitive surgical correction. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this newborn's condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Transposition of great vessels.

The symptoms described, such as extreme cyanosis, progressive respiratory failure, and a single loud S2 heart sound, are consistent with transposition of the great vessels. The machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border is also a characteristic finding in this condition. The ""egg-shaped"" heart on radiography is also a classic feature of transposition of the great vessels.

The fact that the newborn underwent an atrial septostomy to alleviate the condition pending definitive surgical correction further supports this diagnosis. Atrial septostomy is a procedure that creates a hole in the atrial septum to allow oxygenated blood to mix with deoxygenated blood, which is often necessary in transposition of the great vessels to improve oxygenation.

Physical exam reveals enlarged nodules that are not tender to palpation. A biopsy is obtained showing a characteristic change in chromosome 18. The regulation of which of the following proteins will be most abnormal in this patient?,B,"The correct answer is D. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with follicular lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The characteristic change in chromosome 18 refers to the t(14;18) translocation, which is a hallmark of follicular lymphoma. This translocation leads to the overexpression of BCL2, an anti-apoptotic protein that inhibits programmed cell death. As a result, the regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) is abnormal in this patient.

The patient's symptoms, including difficulty combing her hair in the morning, stiff neck, and bilateral shoulder tenderness, are consistent with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). The laboratory results, including an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), also support this diagnosis.

Jaw claudication is a symptom that is commonly associated with giant cell arteritis (GCA), which is a related condition that often occurs in conjunction with PMR. Therefore, the patient should be screened for jaw claudication as part of the evaluation for GCA.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis:

A. Uveitis is a symptom of inflammatory eye disease, which is not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

"A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because she has been unable to conceive for 3 years. Analysis of her husband's semen has shown normal sperm counts during this time. The patient also reports episodic pelvic and back pain accompanied by painful diarrhea for 5 years. She has about one such episode on average per month for 4–6 days. She has taken ibuprofen for the pain, which has provided some relief. Menses have occurred at regular 29-day intervals since menarche at the age of 14 years and last for 7 days. She is sexually active with her husband and does not use contraception. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic and bimanual examinations are normal; rectal examination is unremarkable. A hysterosalpingogram 6 months prior showed normal results. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity.

The patient's symptoms, including episodic pelvic and back pain, painful diarrhea, and infertility, are consistent with endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition in which endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus, leading to inflammation, scarring, and adhesions. The patient's regular menstrual cycles and normal hysterosalpingogram results make other options less likely.",Success
"A 55-year-old truck driver is brought to a physician by his wife. She states that her husband developed a fever and began feeling weak 3 days ago, but has refused medical help. He has been unable to go to work because of his symptoms. The patient has been previously hospitalized for a tricuspid valve replacement surgery 1 year ago and takes aspirin daily. The medical history is also relevant for myocardial infarction 3 years ago and hypertension for the past 10 years, for which he takes lisinopril. His blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, the pulse is 82/min, the respirations are 18/minute, and the temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F). On examination, several hemorrhages are noted on the nail beds of several fingers. Which of the following findings would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is A. Thickened valve with multiple small vegetations.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including fever, weakness, and hemorrhages on the nail beds (Osler's nodes), are consistent with infective endocarditis. The presence of multiple small vegetations on the valve, particularly on a prosthetic valve (tricuspid valve replacement), would be a key finding in establishing a diagnosis of infective endocarditis.",Success
A previously healthy 30-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of pain during sexual intercourse for 6 months. She also reports frequent episodes of crampy pelvic pain that starts one day before menses and lasts for 7 days. Her symptoms are not relieved with pain medication. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 days. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with her husband. She uses a combined oral contraceptive pill. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows rectovaginal tenderness. Cervical and urethral swabs are negative. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,C,"The correct answer is C. Laparoscopy.

The patient's symptoms, including dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse) and crampy pelvic pain that starts before menses and lasts for 7 days, are consistent with endometriosis. The physical examination finding of rectovaginal tenderness also supports this diagnosis. Laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis, as it allows for direct visualization of the pelvic cavity and any lesions or adhesions that may be present.

Measuring CA-125 levels (Option A) may be useful in supporting a diagnosis of endometriosis, but it is not a definitive diagnostic test and would not be the next step in management.

Hysterectomy (Option B) is a surgical procedure that would not be indicated at this point, as the patient is 30 years old and has not yet been definitively diagnosed with endometriosis.

Hysteroscopy (Option D) is a procedure that evaluates the inside of the uterus and would not be helpful in diagnosing endometriosis, which affects the pelvic cavity and surrounding tissues.

A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (Option E) would not be useful in diagnosing endometriosis and would likely not show any abnormalities.",Success

Which of the following lab abnormalities in this patient is an indication for treatment?",D,"The correct answer is D. High LDL-cholesterol.

The patient's LDL-cholesterol level of 186 mg/dL is above the recommended level of 130 mg/dL for individuals with a moderate risk of heart disease. This is an indication for treatment, as high LDL-cholesterol is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

The other options are not necessarily indications for treatment:

A. Blood pressure reading: While the patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, it is not yet in the hypertensive range (140/90 mmHg or higher).

B. Patient's weight: Obesity is a risk factor for various health problems, but it is not a lab abnormality that requires treatment in and of itself.

C. High triglyceride levels: While the patient's triglyceride level is elevated, it is not severely so (severe hypertriglyceridemia is typically defined as a level above 500 mg/dL).

E. Serum glucose level: The patient's fasting glucose level of 105 mg/dL is considered impaired fasting glucose, but it is not yet in the diabetic range (126 mg/dL or higher).",Success
"A 26-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was a restrained passenger. On arrival, she is lethargic and incoherent. She has severe facial lacerations and is in respiratory distress. Her pulse is 130/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 90/58 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. Examination shows multiple facial lacerations. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 12.1 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is B. Traumatic bronchial rupture.

The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with a traumatic bronchial rupture. The deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right suggests a rupture of the left mainstem bronchus, which is confirmed by the depression of the left mainstem bronchus on the chest x-ray. The patient's respiratory distress, decreased breath sounds over the left lung base, and low oxygen saturation also support this diagnosis.

While diaphragmatic rupture (option A) is a possible diagnosis, the lack of abdominal contents in the chest cavity and the presence of bowel sounds make it less likely. Thoracic aortic rupture (option C) is also possible, but the widened mediastinum is not specific to this diagnosis, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a bronchial rupture. Cardiac tamponade (option D) is unlikely given the patient's normal hemoglobin concentration and lack of cardiac symptoms. Tension pneumothorax (option E) is also unlikely given the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings.",Success
"A 26-year-old G1P0 woman presents to her primary care physician’s office with feelings of anxiety and trouble with sleep. She finds it difficult initiating sleep, occasionally has palpitations, and feels fatigued. She denies having similar symptoms in the past or starting any new medications or illicit drugs.

On physical exam, the patient is mildly diaphoretic. The skin is warm and the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged with thyroid bruits. Laboratory studies are significant for a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.01 µU/mL (normal is 0.5-5.0 µU/mL) and an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) that is inappropriate for her pregnancy. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Propylthiouracil.

The patient is presenting with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including anxiety, trouble sleeping, palpitations, and fatigue, which are consistent with an overactive thyroid gland. The physical exam findings of a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with thyroid bruits and laboratory results showing a suppressed TSH level and elevated FT4 level confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.

In pregnancy, the treatment of hyperthyroidism is critical to prevent complications for both the mother and the fetus. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the preferred medication for hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, because it is less likely to cross the placenta and affect the fetal thyroid gland compared to methimazole. Radioiodine therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy, and thyroidectomy may be considered in some cases, but it is not the first-line treatment. Observation is not a suitable option, as untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to serious complications.",Success

"A 3-month-old girl is brought to a pediatrician by her parents. She has central cyanosis without signs of respiratory distress or signs of heart failure. An echocardiogram reveals severe pulmonary outflow obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy, a ventricular septal defect, and an overriding of the aorta. An elective primary surgical repair is planned at 4 months of age. Which of the following statements is true about this girl’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Normal hemoglobin in patients with tetralogy of Fallot does not rule out iron deficiency anemia.

The patient's symptoms and echocardiogram results are consistent with tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect characterized by pulmonary outflow obstruction, ventricular septal defect, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta.

Option B is correct because patients with tetralogy of Fallot may have normal hemoglobin levels due to the increased red blood cell production in response to chronic hypoxia, but they can still have iron deficiency anemia.

Option A is incorrect because the pulmonary valve is more commonly affected by bacterial endocarditis in uncorrected tetralogy of Fallot, not the tricuspid valve.

Option C is incorrect because cerebral venous thrombosis is more common than cerebral arterial thrombosis in patients with tetralogy of Fallot.

Option D is incorrect because refractory heart failure is not a common complication of tetralogy of Fallot.

Option E is correct, but it's not the best answer. The most common age of presentation for brain abscess in patients with tetralogy of Fallot is between 6 and 12 months, but this is not directly related to the patient's condition.",Success

Her only current medication is oxycodone for pain. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is distressed and oriented to person but not to place or time. Neurologic examination shows inattentiveness but no focal deficits. Urine dipstick is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her current condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Delirium.

The patient's symptoms, such as agitation, confusion, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and inattentiveness, are consistent with delirium. Delirium is a common complication in elderly patients, especially after surgery, and can be triggered by various factors, including pain, medication, and environmental changes.

The other options are less likely:

A. Dementia is a chronic condition that would not explain the patient's acute onset of symptoms.

B. Alcohol withdrawal is unlikely given the patient's minimal alcohol consumption and lack of symptoms such as tremors, seizures, or autonomic instability.

C. Opioid intoxication could cause sedation and respiratory depression, but it would not explain the patient's agitation, confusion, and fluctuating levels of consciousness.

E. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a possible cause of delirium in elderly patients, but the normal urine dipstick result makes this less likely. Additionally, UTI would not explain the patient's specific symptoms, such as inattentiveness and fluctuating levels of consciousness.",Success

He has no smoking history, drinks alcohol occasionally, and denies any illicit drug use. His father required a kidney transplant in his forties. The physical exam is notable for palpable flank masses bilaterally. Laboratory studies show a creatinine of 2.5. The physician orders a renal ultrasound, and the results are shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate test to screen for additional complications of this patient's condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. MR angiography of the brain.

The patient's bilateral flank masses and poorly controlled hypertension suggest a diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). PKD is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys, which can lead to kidney failure. The patient's family history of kidney disease and the presence of palpable flank masses support this diagnosis.

PKD can also be associated with other complications, including intracranial aneurysms, which can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage. Therefore, the most appropriate test to screen for additional complications of this patient's condition is MR angiography of the brain to evaluate for intracranial aneurysms.

The other options are not directly related to the complications of PKD:

A. Colonoscopy: While PKD can increase the risk of colon cancer, this is not a direct complication of the disease.

B. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy: There is no clear association between PKD and gastrointestinal complications that would warrant esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms has which of the following modes of inheritance?",A,"The correct answer is A. Autosomal dominant.

The patient's symptoms and test results suggest a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, which is being treated with an anticoagulant medication. The fact that the patient is being monitored with a standard blood test, likely aPTT or INR, suggests that the medication is a heparin or warfarin, which are commonly used to treat pulmonary embolism.

The underlying cause of the patient's symptoms is likely a genetic deficiency of antithrombin III, protein C, or protein S, which are all inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. These deficiencies increase the risk of venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism.",Success
"A 26-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with complaints of burning with urination, penile discharge, and intermittent fevers. A urethral smear shows gram negative diplococci within white blood cells. The organism grows well when cultured on Thayer-Martin agar. The patient is prescribed a course of ceftriaxone and the infection resolves without further complication. One year later, the patient returns with the same infection. Which of the following best explains this lack of lasting immunity?",B,"The correct answer is B. Antigenic variation.

The patient's symptoms and the presence of gram-negative diplococci within white blood cells in the urethral smear suggest a diagnosis of gonorrhea, caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The fact that the patient returns with the same infection a year later suggests that there is no lasting immunity to the infection.

Neisseria gonorrhoeae is able to evade the host's immune system through antigenic variation, which is the ability of the bacterium to change its surface antigens, making it difficult for the host to mount an effective immune response. This means that even if the patient has been infected and cleared the infection previously, they can still be re-infected with a different strain of the bacterium.

The other options are not directly related to the lack of lasting immunity to gonorrhea:

A. Exotoxin release is a mechanism used by some bacteria to cause disease, but it is not related to the lack of immunity to gonorrhea.

C. Polysaccharide capsule is a feature of some bacteria, including Neisseria meningitidis, but it is not the primary mechanism of immune evasion in gonorrhea.

D. Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is a genetic disorder that affects the immune system, but it is not directly related to the lack of immunity to gonorrhea.

Which of the following medications is NOT likely to be the cause?",C,"The correct answer is C. Bromocriptine.

Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that is used to treat hyperprolactinemia (elevated prolactin levels) and is not likely to cause galactorrhea (abnormal milk discharge) or decreased libido.

The other options are all antipsychotic medications that can cause hyperprolactinemia as a side effect, leading to galactorrhea and decreased libido:

* Metoclopramide (A) is an antiemetic that can also cause hyperprolactinemia.

Direct 0.3 mg/dL
Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?""",E,"The correct answer is C. Anti-D antibodies.

The patient's symptoms, including jaundice, mildly distended abdomen, and palpable liver and spleen, are consistent with hemolytic disease of the newborn. The laboratory results show a low hemoglobin, elevated reticulocyte count, and a positive anti-Rh antibody titer in the mother, which suggests that the mother has developed antibodies against the Rh antigen on the fetal red blood cells. This is likely due to fetomaternal hemorrhage during pregnancy, which was not detected due to lack of prenatal care. The fact that the mother is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-negative makes it unlikely that the antibodies are directed against the Rh antigen. Instead, the antibodies are likely directed against another antigen, such as the B antigen, which is present on the fetal red blood cells.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with myxedema coma, a life-threatening condition that occurs in patients with severe hypothyroidism. The patient's altered mental status, decorticate posturing, and incomprehensible speech suggest a neurological impairment. The physical examination findings of dry hair, coarse and waxy skin, and non-pitting edema around the face and extremities are also consistent with hypothyroidism. The laboratory results show a significantly elevated TSH level (110.0 µU/mL) and low T4 (1.2 µg/dL) and T3 (70 ng/dL) levels, which confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, particularly with exertion, are consistent with heart failure, which can be caused by aortic regurgitation.
* The physical examination findings are also consistent with aortic regurgitation:
	+ The early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border is characteristic of aortic regurgitation.
	+ The midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border may indicate aortic stenosis, but the presence of aortic regurgitation is more likely given the other findings.
	+ The late diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex is consistent with mitral stenosis, but this is less likely given the other findings.
	+ The S3 heart sound is consistent with heart failure, which can be caused by aortic regurgitation.
	+ The bounding pulses at the radial arteries bilaterally are consistent with aortic regurgitation, which can cause a wide pulse pressure.

While mitral regurgitation (A) and mitral stenosis (B) are possible diagnoses, the physical examination findings are more consistent with aortic regurgitation. Aortic stenosis (D) is less likely given the presence of a diastolic murmur, and mitral prolapse (E) is not supported by the physical examination findings.",Success
"A 28-year-old woman presents following a suicide attempt 2 days ago. She says that her attempt was a result of a fight with her boyfriend and that she slit her wrists in an attempt to keep him from breaking up with her. In the past, she has had many turbulent relationships, both romantic and in her family life. Her family members describe her as being very impulsive and frequently acting to manipulate people’s feelings. Since she was admitted to the hospital, she has spit at several staff members and alternated between sobbing and anger. She has no significant past medical history. The patient denies any history of smoking, alcohol use, or recreational drug use. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Borderline personality disorder.

The patient's behavior and history are consistent with borderline personality disorder, which is characterized by:

* Impulsivity and self-destructive behavior (suicide attempt, wrist-slitting)
* Turbulent relationships and intense emotional dysregulation
* Manipulative behavior towards others (attempting to keep boyfriend from breaking up with her)
* Emotional instability and intense mood swings (sobbing and anger)
* Impulsive and aggressive behavior towards others (spitting at staff members)

While histrionic personality disorder (A) may also involve dramatic and attention-seeking behavior, it does not typically involve self-destructive behavior or intense emotional dysregulation. Dependent personality disorder (C) is characterized by a need for others to take care of one's emotional needs, which is not evident in this patient's behavior. Avoidant personality disorder (D) involves social withdrawal and fear of rejection, which is not consistent with this patient's behavior. Narcissistic personality disorder (E) involves a grandiose sense of self-importance and a need for admiration, which is not evident in this patient's behavior.",Success
"A 50-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor following an inguinal hernia repair. The patient reports no pain in his lower abdomen or groin, no constipation, and states that he enjoys his usual diet. He denies any use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. He has returned to work as a cruise ship attendant. Preoperative workup included chest radiography which demonstrated an opacification in his right middle lobe. The patient agrees to undergo computed tomography (CT) of his chest without contrast for further evaluation. The radiologist reports an 8 mm nodule in the patient's peripheral right middle lobe that has regular margins and appears calcified. One year later, the patient obtains another chest CT without contrast that reports the nodule size as 10 mm with similar characteristics. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is A. CT chest without contrast in 12 months.

The patient has a small, calcified nodule in the right middle lobe that has grown from 8 mm to 10 mm over a year. This growth suggests that the nodule may be malignant, but the calcification and slow growth rate suggest that it may be benign. The most appropriate next step is to continue monitoring the nodule with CT scans to assess for further growth. The Fleischner Society guidelines recommend follow-up CT scans at 12-month intervals for nodules that are 8-10 mm in size and have a low risk of malignancy.",Success
"A 29-year-old man comes in for evaluation of infertility. He has been trying to conceive for over 2 years with his wife and previous evaluation of his wife's fertility revealed no abnormalities. Physical exam reveals a tall man with long extremities, sparse body hair, gynecomastia, and small testes. Laboratory studies reveal increased serum follicle-stimulating hormone concentration and an increased estradiol:testosterone ratio. Genetic studies reveal a cytogenetic abnormality. If this abnormality was inherited from the patient's father, at which stage of spermatogenesis did this error most likely occur?",A,"The correct answer is D. Spermatogonium.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Klinefelter syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome (47, XXY). This occurs when there is a nondisjunction event during meiosis, resulting in an abnormal number of chromosomes.

Since the patient inherited the abnormality from his father, the error most likely occurred during spermatogenesis in the father, specifically during the stage of spermatogonium. Spermatogonia are the diploid stem cells that give rise to spermatozoa. If a nondisjunction event occurs during this stage, it can result in spermatozoa with an abnormal number of chromosomes, which can then fertilize an egg and lead to a child with Klinefelter syndrome.",Success
"A 13-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with severe knee, hip, and groin pain. The patient has a past medical history notable only for obesity and asthma. His temperature is 98°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 124/65 mmHg, pulse is 128/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an inability of the patient to bear weight on his left leg and limited range of motion of the left hip. Which of the following is the best management for this patient?",E,"The correct answer is D. Surgical drainage of the hip.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with a diagnosis of septic arthritis of the hip, which is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment. The patient's inability to bear weight on his left leg and limited range of motion of the left hip suggest a serious infection that requires surgical intervention.

Surgical drainage of the hip is the best management option for this patient, as it allows for the removal of infected fluid and debris from the joint, which can help to reduce the risk of long-term damage to the joint and surrounding tissues.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient:

A. Casting and crutches would not address the underlying infection and could potentially worsen the patient's condition.

B. Immobilization of the hip in a Pavlik harness is typically used for developmental dysplasia of the hip, not septic arthritis.

C. Supportive therapy and observation would not provide adequate treatment for the patient's infection and could lead to further complications.

E. Surgical pinning of the femoral head is not indicated for septic arthritis and would not address the underlying infection.",Success

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""",D,"The correct answer is D. Bacterial translocation.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is a complication of cirrhosis. The presence of fever, abdominal pain, and confusion, along with the physical examination findings of scleral icterus, spider angiomas, and ascites, are consistent with liver disease. The paracentesis results, including a low albumin concentration, high glucose concentration, and a high leukocyte count with a predominance of neutrophils, are also consistent with SBP.

Bacterial translocation, which is the passage of bacteria from the gut into the bloodstream and other organs, is a common complication of cirrhosis and is thought to be the underlying mechanism of SBP. The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.",Success
"An 18-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department because of a cough that her parents are worried about. She has had a runny nose and a low-grade fever for the past 2 days, with some hoarseness and a rough-sounding cough that started this afternoon. This evening she began making some high-pitched sounds when taking breaths, and she seemed to be having some trouble breathing. She is alert and does not appear to be in acute distress. She has a temperature of 38.0°C (100.4 °F), with a respiratory rate of 50/min and O2 saturation of 97%. There is audible inspiratory stridor that worsens when she starts to cry during the examination. She has an occasional barking cough. Her pharynx is mildly erythematous with normal tonsils and no exudate. A frontal X-ray of the upper chest airways is obtained (shown in the image). Which of the following is the best step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Racemic epinephrine and intramuscular corticosteroid therapy.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with croup, a viral infection that causes inflammation of the upper airway. The presence of inspiratory stridor, barking cough, and the X-ray finding of a ""steeple sign"" (narrowing of the trachea) support this diagnosis.

Racemic epinephrine is a medication that can help reduce airway swelling and relieve symptoms. Intramuscular corticosteroid therapy is also effective in reducing inflammation and improving symptoms. This combination is the best step in management for this patient.

Intubation (B) may be necessary in severe cases of croup, but it is not the first step in management. Anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs of the neck (A) may be helpful in ruling out other diagnoses, but they are not necessary in this case. Intravenous antibiotics (D) are not indicated for viral croup. A trial of bronchodilator therapy and oral steroids (E) may be helpful in other respiratory conditions, but they are not the best choice for croup.",Success
"A 43-year-old woman presents with complaints of retrosternal burning associated with eating. It has persisted for the past several years but has been getting worse. Her past medical history is unknown and this is her first time seeing a doctor. She states she is otherwise healthy and review of systems is notable for episodic hand pain that is worse in the winter as well as a chronic and severe cough with dyspnea which she attributes to her smoking. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 174/104 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a young appearing woman with coarse breath sounds. Laboratory studies and urinalysis are ordered and currently pending. Which of the following is the pathophysiology of this patient's chief complaint?",B,"The correct answer is A. Decreased lower esophageal tone.

The patient's symptoms of retrosternal burning associated with eating are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) does not function properly, allowing stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus and cause symptoms. The LES is a ring-like muscle that normally relaxes to allow food to pass into the stomach and then tightens to prevent stomach acid from flowing back up into the esophagus. In GERD, the LES tone is decreased, allowing stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus and cause symptoms.",Success

The patient is prescribed a drug to treat the cause of his current symptoms. The drug's mechanism of action directly involves which of the following signaling pathways?""",D,"The correct answer is D. JAK/STAT.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest anemia, which is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. The patient is likely to be prescribed erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells. EPO works by binding to its receptor on the surface of erythroid progenitor cells, activating the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, which leads to the transcription of genes involved in erythropoiesis.",Success
"A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of muscle cramping, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. He says that these symptoms came on rapidly but does not recall anything that may have triggered the episode. He has never experienced these symptoms before. His past medical history is significant for obesity, sleep apnea, and type 2 diabetes that is well controlled on metformin. He also has gastroesophageal reflux disease for which he occasionally takes antacids. On presentation he is found to have fast, shallow breathing and abdominal pain that is poorly localized. Basic labs as well as an arterial blood gas are obtained and the results are shown below:

Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 106 mEq/L
HCO3-: 11 mEq/L
pH: 7.25
pCO2: 22 mmHg

Which of the following is the most likely cause of the changes seen in this patient's labs?",D,"The correct answer is C. Diarrhea.

The patient's lab results show a metabolic acidosis, characterized by a low pH (7.25) and low bicarbonate level (11 mEq/L). The anion gap, which is calculated by subtracting the chloride and bicarbonate levels from the sodium level, is normal (139 - 106 - 11 = 12), suggesting that the acidosis is not due to an increase in anions such as lactate, ketones, or other organic acids.

The patient's symptoms, including diarrhea, muscle cramping, and abdominal pain, are consistent with a gastrointestinal cause of the acidosis. The diarrhea likely led to a loss of bicarbonate-rich fluids, resulting in a metabolic acidosis.

The other options are not likely causes of the patient's lab results:

A. Antacids would not cause a metabolic acidosis.

B. Anxiety would not cause a metabolic acidosis, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with anxiety.

D. Metformin can cause lactic acidosis, but the patient's lab results do not show an elevated anion gap, making this less likely.

E. Sleep apnea can cause respiratory acidosis, but the patient's lab results show a metabolic acidosis.",Success
"A scientist is studying the properties of myosin-actin interactions in a sample of human muscle tissue. She has identified a drug that selectively inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head. If she gives this drug to a sample of human muscle tissue under physiologic conditions, which of the following steps in cross-bridge cycling will most likely be blocked?",E,"The correct answer is E. Power stroke.

Here's why:

When the myosin head binds to actin, it undergoes a conformational change that releases phosphate and generates force (the power stroke). The release of phosphate is necessary for the power stroke to occur. If the drug selectively inhibits phosphate release, it will prevent the power stroke from occurring, effectively blocking the cross-bridge cycle at this step.

The other options are not directly related to phosphate release:

A. Myosin head release from actin occurs after the power stroke, so it's not directly affected by the drug.

B. Myosin head cocking occurs before phosphate release and the power stroke, so it's not blocked by the drug.

C. Exposure of myosin-binding sites on actin is a step that occurs before myosin head binding, so it's not affected by the drug.

D. Myosin head binding to actin is not directly related to phosphate release, and the drug doesn't prevent binding.",Success

Neurological examination shows decreased strength in the right lower leg with normal strength in the other extremities. Fundoscopic examination shows several multinodular, calcified lesions in the retina bilaterally. A photograph of his skin findings is shown. This patient's condition is most likely due to a mutation in which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is D. TSC1 gene on chromosome 9.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes. The key features that suggest TSC include:

* Seizure disorder and cognitive delay
* Multinodular, calcified lesions in the retina bilaterally (retinal hamartomas)
* Skin findings, likely showing hypopigmented macules (ash leaf spots) or angiofibromas
* Cardiac murmur, possibly due to a cardiac rhabdomyoma
* Neurological examination showing decreased strength in the right lower leg, suggesting a possible cortical tuber or subependymal giant cell astrocytoma

Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's laboratory derangements?",D,"The correct answer is D. Metformin.

The patient's laboratory results show a metabolic acidosis with a low bicarbonate level (11 mEq/L) and an elevated anion gap (calculated anion gap = 141 - 99 - 11 = 31, which is elevated). The patient's creatinine level is also elevated at 3.1 mg/dL, indicating renal impairment.

Metformin, an oral hypoglycemic agent, is known to cause lactic acidosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment. The patient's history of diabetic nephropathy and current creatinine level suggest that he may be at risk for metformin-associated lactic acidosis.

The other options are less likely to be the cause of the patient's laboratory derangements:

A. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication that can cause renal impairment, but it is not typically associated with lactic acidosis.

B. Atorvastatin is a statin medication that can cause mild elevations in creatinine, but it is not typically associated with lactic acidosis.

The pulmonary examination reveals a mildly prolonged expiratory phase, and no wheezing or crackles are auscultated. A pulmonary function test is recommended for the patient, and 2 weeks later he returns with a report that shows an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% and FEV1 of 50% of the predicted value. The lung volumes show a total lung capacity of 110% of predicted value, a residual volume of 115% of predicted value, and a DLCO of 60% of predicted value. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The patient's symptoms, medical history, and pulmonary function test results are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is a former smoker with a significant smoking history, which is a major risk factor for COPD. The pulmonary function test results show an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%, which is below the normal range, indicating airflow obstruction. The FEV1 of 50% of predicted value also suggests significant airflow limitation. The lung volumes show a total lung capacity of 110% of predicted value and a residual volume of 115% of predicted value, which is consistent with hyperinflation, a characteristic feature of COPD. The DLCO of 60% of predicted value suggests some degree of emphysema.

Asbestosis (A) is unlikely given the patient's history of working in a steel mill, but the pulmonary function test results do not show the characteristic restrictive pattern and decreased DLCO seen in asbestosis.

Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (B) is unlikely given the patient's normal oxygen saturation at rest and the absence of other symptoms suggestive of sleep-disordered breathing.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (C) is unlikely given the patient's history of smoking and the pulmonary function test results, which do not show the characteristic restrictive pattern and decreased DLCO seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

Allergies include peanuts, dust, and pollen. Childhood asthma runs in the family. Chest X-ray reveals diffuse haziness in both lower lung fields. A PPD skin test is negative. What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Avoid exposure to birds.

The patient's symptoms, including a dry cough, fever, and chills, are consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a type of lung disease caused by an allergic reaction to inhaled substances. The fact that the symptoms occur at the end of the workday and last a few hours suggests that the patient is being exposed to the allergen at work. The patient's job as a zookeeper, particularly his exposure to birds, is the likely source of the allergen.

Avoiding exposure to birds is the most appropriate treatment for this patient. This may involve removing the patient from his job or taking steps to minimize his exposure to bird dust and feathers. Other treatments, such as corticosteroids, may also be necessary to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms.

Thoracocentesis (A) is a procedure to drain fluid from the chest cavity and is not indicated in this case. Inhaled beclomethasone (B) may be used to treat asthma, but it is not the primary treatment for hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Isoniazid (D) is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis, which is not suspected in this case based on the negative PPD skin test.

"A 60-year-old female presents to her gynecologist with vaginal bleeding. She underwent menopause ten years prior. She has a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. On physical examination, her uterus is uniformly enlarged. Ultrasound reveals a thickened endometrial stripe and tissue biopsy reveals neoplastic endometrial cells. A workup for metastatic disease is negative and the gynecologist recommends a laparoscopic hysterectomy. During the procedure, the surgeon ligates multiple vessels in order to remove the entire uterus. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient develops left-sided flank pain and oliguria. Serum creatinine is found to be 1.4 mg/dl whereas it was 1.0 mg/dl prior to the operation. Renal ultrasound is normal. Urinalysis is notable for hematuria. Ligation of which of the following vessels most likely contributed to this patient’s condition?",D,"The correct answer is B. Ovarian artery.

The patient's symptoms of left-sided flank pain, oliguria, and hematuria suggest a diagnosis of ureteral injury or obstruction. The fact that the renal ultrasound is normal suggests that the problem is not related to the kidney itself, but rather to the ureter.

During a laparoscopic hysterectomy, the ovarian arteries are ligated to control bleeding from the uterus. However, the ovarian arteries are in close proximity to the ureters, and ligation of the ovarian artery can sometimes inadvertently damage or ligate the ureter, leading to obstruction or injury.

The other options are not directly related to the ureter and are less likely to cause the patient's symptoms:

A. The artery of Sampson is a small artery that supplies the round ligament of the uterus and is not related to the ureter.

C. The superior vesical artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery that supplies the bladder, but it is not typically ligated during a hysterectomy.

D. The uterine artery is ligated during a hysterectomy, but it is not in close proximity to the ureter and is less likely to cause ureteral injury.

Laboratory evaluation confirms the diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Which of the following viral infections is most likely to have played a role in the pathogenesis of this patient’s malignancy?",B,"The correct answer is B. Epstein-Barr virus.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's lymphoma, particularly in the mixed cellularity subtype. EBV infection can lead to the transformation of B cells, which can then give rise to Hodgkin's lymphoma. Studies have shown that EBV DNA is present in the tumor cells of many patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, and that EBV infection can trigger the development of the disease.

A week prior to her symptoms, she had traveled to Brazil where she spent most of the evenings hiking. She did not use any mosquito repellents. There is no personal or family history of chronic or congenital diseases. Medications include iron supplementation and a multivitamin. She received all of the recommended childhood vaccinations. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. The IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis were negative. Which of the following is the most likely etiologic agent?",E,"The correct answer is E. Zika virus.

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash, are consistent with Zika virus infection. The fact that she traveled to Brazil, where Zika virus is endemic, and did not use mosquito repellents, increases the likelihood of Zika virus infection. The ultrasound finding of fetal microcephaly is also consistent with congenital Zika virus infection. The negative toxoplasmosis titers rule out option D. While dengue virus can cause similar symptoms, it is not typically associated with fetal microcephaly. Rubella virus can cause congenital infections, but the patient's symptoms and travel history are more consistent with Zika virus.

 A non-contrast CT of the head is performed and shown in the picture. Which of the following would be the next best diagnostic step in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Mixing study.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). The non-contrast CT of the head shows a hyperdense signal in the superior sagittal sinus, which is consistent with CVST.

A mixing study is the next best diagnostic step in this patient because it can help diagnose a coagulation disorder, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or a lupus anticoagulant, which can cause CVST. A mixing study involves mixing the patient's plasma with normal plasma and measuring the clotting times. If the clotting times correct with the addition of normal plasma, it suggests a coagulation factor deficiency. If the clotting times do not correct, it suggests the presence of an inhibitor, such as a lupus anticoagulant.

The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis of CVST or a coagulation disorder:

B. INR (International Normalized Ratio) is a measure of warfarin anticoagulation and is not relevant in this scenario.

"A obstetrician is working in a developing country to help promote maternal health and fetal well being. While there, he delivers a baby who he suspects has congenital hypothyroidism, most likely caused by inadequate maternal iodine intake. Which of the following signs and symptoms would NOT be expected to be observed in this child?",B,"The correct answer is B. Diarrhea.

Congenital hypothyroidism is typically associated with symptoms such as hypotonia (A), umbilical hernia (C), mild jaundice (D), and macroglossia (E). However, diarrhea is not a typical symptom of congenital hypothyroidism. In fact, constipation is more commonly seen in hypothyroidism due to decreased gut motility.",Success
"A 33-year-old nurse is referred to an infectious disease specialist after she exhibited a PPD skin test with 17 mm of induration. She denies any cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, weight loss, fatigue, fevers, or night sweats over the last several months. Her temperature is 97.0°F (36.1°C), blood pressure is 120/81 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. An initial chest radiograph is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Isoniazid.

The patient has a positive PPD skin test with 17 mm of induration, indicating latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Since she is a healthcare worker and has no symptoms or radiographic evidence of active tuberculosis, the most appropriate management is to treat her with isoniazid (INH) for 9 months to prevent the development of active tuberculosis. This is a standard recommendation for individuals with LTBI who are at high risk of developing active tuberculosis, such as healthcare workers.",Success
"An 81-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room by her son after witnessing the patient fall and hit her head. The son reports that the patient was in her usual state of health until she complained of chest palpitations. This startled her while she was climbing down the stairs and lead to a fall. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Medications are lisinopril, metoprolol, and warfarin. Temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 152/96 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 12/min, and pulse oximetry is 98% on room air. On physical examination, she is disoriented and at times difficult to arouse, the left pupil is 6 mm and non-reactive to light, and the right pupil is 2 mm and reactive to light. A right-sided visual field defect is appreciated on visual field testing. There is 1/5 strength on the right upper and lower extremity; as well as 5/5 strength in the left upper and lower extremity. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head is shown. Which of the following most likely explains this patient’s symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Herniation of the uncus.

The patient's symptoms, including disorientation, unequal pupils, and a right-sided visual field defect, suggest a compressive lesion affecting the left side of the brain. The CT scan shows a left-sided subdural hematoma, which is likely causing the symptoms.

The unequal pupils, with the left pupil being 6 mm and non-reactive to light, suggest compression of the left oculomotor nerve, which is consistent with uncal herniation. Uncal herniation occurs when the medial part of the temporal lobe (the uncus) herniates through the tentorial notch, compressing the brainstem and cranial nerves.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings:

B. Herniation of the cingulate gyrus would not cause the described symptoms.

C. Occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery would cause symptoms related to the medial aspect of the frontal and parietal lobes, not the temporal lobe.

D. Occlusion of the basilar artery would cause brainstem symptoms, not unilateral symptoms like the patient is experiencing.

E. Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery would cause spinal cord symptoms, not brain symptoms like the patient is experiencing.",Success
"A 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after the results of serum protein electrophoresis showed monoclonal gammopathy. A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Which of the following best describes this class of immune cells?",D,"The correct answer is D. Natural killer cells.

Natural killer (NK) cells are a type of immune cell that can recognize and lyse abnormal cells, such as tumor cells or virally infected cells, without the need for prior activation or antigen presentation. They are able to do this through the recognition of certain surface molecules, such as MHC class I, which are often downregulated on abnormal cells.

In this scenario, the monoclonal plasma cells have downregulated MHC class I molecules, making them susceptible to recognition and lysis by NK cells. NK cells play an important role in immune surveillance and can help to prevent the proliferation of abnormal cells, including cancer cells.

The other options are not correct because:

A. CD8+ T lymphocytes require antigen presentation and activation before they can lyse target cells.

B. Bone marrow-derived macrophages are involved in phagocytosis and antigen presentation, but they do not lyse abnormal cells without prior activation.

C. CD4+ T lymphocytes are involved in helper functions and activation of other immune cells, but they do not directly lyse abnormal cells.

E. Band neutrophils are immature neutrophils that are not involved in immune surveillance or lysis of abnormal cells.",Success
"A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive muscle weakness for five months. She feels that the muscles in her shoulders and hips have been getting weaker and sometimes feel sore. She now has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. She has also noticed new difficulty with swallowing solid foods, but has no trouble with liquids. She has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia controlled with fluvastatin. Her maternal uncle died at age 26 from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and her mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurologic examination shows moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 13.7 g/dL
Leukocytes 11,200/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 33 mm/h
Serum
Creatine kinase 212 U/L
Lactate dehydrogenase 164 U/L
AST 34 U/L
ALT 35 U/L
Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""",A,"The correct answer is C. Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of dermatomyositis, a type of inflammatory myopathy. The presence of muscle weakness, particularly in the shoulder and hip muscles, and difficulty with swallowing solid foods are consistent with this diagnosis. The elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels also support this diagnosis.

Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy is a characteristic finding in dermatomyositis, and would confirm the diagnosis.

Option A is incorrect because intrafascicular infiltration is more characteristic of neurogenic disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Option B is incorrect because inflammation of synovial spaces is more characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis or other joint disorders.

Option D is incorrect because positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies are more characteristic of myasthenia gravis, a disorder of the neuromuscular junction.

Option E is incorrect because dystrophin gene mutation is more characteristic of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, which is a genetic disorder that affects muscle function.",Success
"A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency room with sudden onset of blurry vision one hour ago. He states that he was resting at home when he noticed he had difficulty reading. Currently, he is also starting to see double, and is seeing two images on top of each other. Earlier today, he felt ill with nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, which he attributed to food he had eaten at a picnic the day before. When asked which foods he ate, he lists potato salad, a hamburger, deviled eggs, and pickles made by his neighbor. He also heard that his friend who went to the picnic with him has developed similar symptoms and was seen in another hospital earlier. While in the emergency room, the patient’s temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), pulse is 75/min, blood pressure is 122/84 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Cranial nerve exam is notable for fixed pupillary dilation, and difficulty depressing both eyes. The remainder of his exam is normal. Which of the following is the pathogenesis of this patient’s presentation?",A,"The correct answer is A. Decreased acetylcholine release.

The patient's symptoms, including blurry vision, diplopia (double vision), and fixed pupillary dilation, suggest a cholinergic crisis, which is consistent with botulism poisoning. Botulinum toxin, produced by Clostridium botulinum, inhibits the release of acetylcholine from nerve terminals, leading to a decrease in acetylcholine release. This results in a range of neurological symptoms, including cranial nerve palsies, pupillary dilation, and muscle weakness.

The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of botulism:

B. Overactivation of adenylate cyclase is associated with cholera toxin, not botulinum toxin.

C. Release of interferon-gamma is an immune response to viral infections, not related to botulism.

D. Degradation of phospholipids is not a known mechanism of botulism.

E. Inhibition of GABA release is associated with certain neurological disorders, but not botulism.

The patient's history of eating food from a picnic, particularly the homemade pickles, suggests a possible source of botulinum toxin. The fact that his friend who attended the same picnic has similar symptoms further supports this diagnosis.",Success
"A 4-week-old female newborn is brought to the physician because of increasing yellowing of her eyes and skin for 2 weeks. The mother has noticed that the girl's stools have become pale over the past week. She was breastfed since birth but her parents switched her to formula feeds recently after reading on the internet that breastfeeding could be the cause of her current symptoms. The patient was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is at the 50th percentile for length and at the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum studies show:
Bilirubin

Direct 12.3 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase 2007 U/L
AST 53 U/L
ALT 45 U/L
γ-glutamyl transferase 154 U/L
Blood group A positive
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Biliary atresia.

The patient's symptoms, such as increasing jaundice, pale stools, and elevated direct bilirubin, suggest a diagnosis of biliary atresia. The elevated alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transferase levels also support this diagnosis. Biliary atresia is a congenital disorder characterized by the absence or closure of the bile ducts, leading to jaundice, pale stools, and liver damage.

Galactosemia (A) is a metabolic disorder that can cause jaundice, but it is less likely given the patient's normal AST and ALT levels. Crigler-Najjar syndrome (C) is a rare genetic disorder that affects bilirubin metabolism, but it typically presents with indirect hyperbilirubinemia, not direct hyperbilirubinemia like in this case. Breast milk jaundice (D) is a common cause of jaundice in newborns, but it typically resolves on its own and is not associated with pale stools or elevated liver enzymes. Dubin-Johnson syndrome (E) is a rare genetic disorder that affects bilirubin excretion, but it typically presents with a more gradual onset of jaundice and is not associated with pale stools or elevated liver enzymes.",Success
"A 43-year-old man comes to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and progressive perioral numbness for the past 24 hours. 3 days ago, he underwent a total thyroidectomy for treatment of papillary thyroid cancer. His only medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes a spasm in the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck. Which of the following ECG findings are most likely in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. QT prolongation.

The patient's symptoms, such as nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and perioral numbness, are consistent with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels). The hand spasm observed by the nurse is also a classic sign of hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia is a common complication of total thyroidectomy, particularly if the parathyroid glands are inadvertently removed or damaged during surgery.

On an electrocardiogram (ECG), hypocalcemia can cause QT prolongation, which is a lengthening of the QT interval. This is because calcium plays a crucial role in cardiac electrophysiology, and low calcium levels can disrupt the normal functioning of the heart's electrical conduction system.

The other options are not directly related to hypocalcemia:

A. Torsade de pointes is a type of ventricular tachycardia that can be caused by QT prolongation, but it is not a direct result of hypocalcemia.

C. U waves are typically seen in hypokalemia (low potassium levels), not hypocalcemia.

D. Peaked T waves are seen in hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), not hypocalcemia.

"A 68-year-old woman presents with left lower quadrant pain that worsens with defecation. She describes the pain as 'crampy'. She also says she has suffered from mild constipation for the past few years. The patient denies any recent weight change or urinary symptoms. Her last menstrual period was 16 years ago. Her body temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 102/min, respiratory rate is 16/min, and blood pressure is 133/87 mm Hg. On physical examination, tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant is present. The laboratory studies are presented as follows:
Hemoglobin 13.2 mg/dL
Hematocrit 48%
Leukocyte count 16,000/mm³
Neutrophils 89%
Bands 5%
Eosinophils 0%
Basophils 0%
Lymphocytes 11%
Monocytes 0%
Platelet count 380,000/mm³
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Diverticulitis.

The patient's symptoms of left lower quadrant pain that worsens with defecation, along with the physical examination finding of tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant, are consistent with diverticulitis. The laboratory studies also support this diagnosis, as the patient has a leukocytosis with a left shift (increased neutrophils and bands), which is indicative of an inflammatory response. The patient's age and history of mild constipation also increase the likelihood of diverticulitis.

The other options are less likely:

B. Hypothyroidism is unlikely given the patient's normal body temperature and lack of other symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism.

C. Adenocarcinoma of the colon is possible, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory studies are more consistent with an inflammatory process such as diverticulitis rather than a malignant process.

D. Chronic inflammatory bowel disease is unlikely given the patient's lack of symptoms consistent with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, or other systemic symptoms.

He also endorses deep and burning buttock and hip pain when walking, which is relieved by rest. The patient states that he does not have erections at night or in the morning. His past medical history is notable for diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypertension, and he has a 40 pack-year smoking history. Physical exam is notable for weak lower extremity and femoral pulses. Which of the following is the most specific etiology of this patient’s symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Aortoiliac atherosclerosis.

The patient's symptoms of erectile dysfunction, buttock and hip pain when walking (relieved by rest), and weak lower extremity and femoral pulses are consistent with aortoiliac atherosclerosis, also known as Leriche syndrome. This condition is a type of peripheral artery disease that affects the aortoiliac segment, leading to reduced blood flow to the lower extremities and pelvis, resulting in erectile dysfunction and claudication symptoms.

While anxiety (A) may contribute to erectile dysfunction, it is not the most specific etiology in this case. Diabetic neuropathy (C) may cause erectile dysfunction, but it would not typically cause the buttock and hip pain or weak pulses seen in this patient. Spinal stenosis (D) may cause back and leg pain, but it would not typically cause erectile dysfunction or weak pulses. Vascular claudication (E) is a symptom of peripheral artery disease, but it is not a specific etiology.",Success
A 55-year-old man with a history of chronic glomerulonephritis due to IgA nephropathy presents to your office with bone pain. Which of the following laboratory findings would you most expect upon analysis of this patient's serum?,A,"The correct answer is A. Increased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, decreased calcitriol.

This patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to IgA nephropathy, which can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. The kidneys play a crucial role in vitamin D metabolism and phosphate excretion. In CKD, the kidneys are unable to activate vitamin D, leading to decreased calcitriol levels. This, in turn, leads to hypocalcemia (decreased calcium levels), which stimulates the parathyroid glands to produce more parathyroid hormone (PTH). The increased PTH levels then stimulate the release of phosphate from bones, leading to hyperphosphatemia (increased phosphate levels).",Success
"A medical researcher is studying the physiology of the immune system in order to better understand the effects of HIV on patients. He isolates a group of cells that are shown by flow cytometry to be positive for the cell surface marker CD8. He then mixes this cell population with a group of infected cells, crosslinks extracellular interactions, and immunoprecipitates the CD8 protein. He identifies a protein bound to CD8 that is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell. Which of the following best describes the primary function of the protein that was most likely identified?",C,"The correct answer is C. Binds endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel.

The researcher isolated CD8+ cells, which are cytotoxic T cells. CD8 is a co-receptor that helps T cells recognize and bind to antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that display peptides on their surface via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules.

The protein bound to CD8 that is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell is likely MHC class I. MHC class I molecules present endogenous peptides (derived from proteins produced within the cell) to CD8+ T cells. These peptides are transported to the endoplasmic reticulum by the TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) channel, where they are loaded onto MHC class I molecules.

Therefore, the primary function of the protein identified is to bind endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel.",Success
"A 61-year-old Caucasian male presents to your office with chest pain. He states that he is worried about his heart, as his father died at age 62 from a heart attack. He reports that his chest pain worsens with large meals and spicy foods and improves with calcium carbonate. He denies dyspnea on exertion and an ECG is normal. What is the most likely cause of this patient's pain?",D,"The correct answer is D. Gastroesophageal junction incompetence.

The patient's symptoms, such as chest pain that worsens with large meals and spicy foods and improves with calcium carbonate, are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The fact that the ECG is normal suggests that the pain is not related to cardiac ischemia. The patient's family history of heart disease is a red herring, and the other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms.",Success
"A 36-year-old woman comes to the clinic because of tearing and a foreign body sensation in her eyes bilaterally, which has gradually worsened over the last several weeks. She also notes having occasional palpitations, nervousness, sweating, and heat intolerance. Her past medical history is unremarkable. She reports a 20-pack-year smoking history and is currently a daily smoker. Physical examination shows an anxious, trembling woman. She has eyelid retraction bilaterally, with an inability to fully close her eyes. Her extraocular motility is limited on upgaze. There is no thyromegaly, and no thyroid nodules are noted. Laboratory studies reveal a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.1 μU/mL and total T4 of 42 μg/dL. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin is positive. CT scan of the orbits shows proptosis and marked enlargement of the extraocular muscle with sparing of the tendons. Which of the following would most likely transiently worsen this patient’s eye symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is E. Treatment with radioactive iodine.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism. The eye symptoms, including tearing, foreign body sensation, eyelid retraction, and limited extraocular motility, are due to thyroid-associated orbitopathy (TAO).

Radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment is often used to treat hyperthyroidism, but it can transiently worsen TAO symptoms in some patients. This is because RAI can cause a release of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland, leading to a temporary increase in inflammation and swelling in the orbits.

The other options are not likely to worsen the patient's eye symptoms:

A. External orbital radiation may be used to treat TAO, but it is not expected to worsen symptoms.

B. Selenium supplementation has been shown to improve TAO symptoms in some studies.

C. Smoking cessation may actually improve TAO symptoms, as smoking is a risk factor for the development and progression of TAO.

D. Systemic corticosteroids may be used to treat TAO, and they are likely to improve symptoms rather than worsen them.",Success

His neurologic and abdominal examinations are completely normal. His laboratory investigations are as follows:
Urine-specific gravity (first-morning sample) 1.035
Urine red blood cells Absent
Urine pus cells Absent
Urine culture Negative
Which of the following is the next step in the management of this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Reassuring the parents and use of an enuresis alarm.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with nocturnal enuresis, also known as bedwetting. The fact that he has never been dry at night continuously for 1 week suggests that this is a primary nocturnal enuresis, rather than a secondary enuresis that occurs after a period of dryness.

The laboratory investigations rule out any underlying urinary tract infection or kidney disease. The normal physical examination and laboratory results suggest that there is no underlying neurological or anatomical abnormality.

The next step in management would be to reassure the parents and the child that nocturnal enuresis is a common and treatable condition. An enuresis alarm is a device that is worn on the child's underwear and sounds an alarm when it detects moisture, helping the child to wake up and go to the bathroom. This is a non-invasive and effective treatment for nocturnal enuresis.

Serum adrenocorticotropin-releasing hormone (ACTH) 2 pg/mL (> 5 pg/mL)

A 48-hour high dose dexamethasone suppression trial shows that her serum cortisol levels do not decrease. What is the best next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. MRI of the adrenal glands.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Cushing's syndrome, a hormonal disorder caused by excessive levels of cortisol in the body. The 24-hour urinary cortisol level is elevated, and the serum cortisol level is also high. The low ACTH level suggests that the cortisol excess is not driven by ACTH, which points to an adrenal source.

The lack of suppression of cortisol levels with high-dose dexamethasone suggests that the cortisol production is autonomous and not regulated by the pituitary gland. This, combined with the low ACTH level, suggests an adrenal tumor or hyperplasia as the likely cause of the Cushing's syndrome.

Therefore, the next step in management would be to image the adrenal glands to look for a tumor or hyperplasia, which is best done with an MRI of the adrenal glands (Option A).",Success
A 67-year-woman with non-Hodgkin lymphoma comes to the physician because of progressively increasing numbness and tingling in her fingers and toes. Her last cycle of chemotherapy with vincristine was 1 week ago. Physical examination shows decreased sensation to light touch in all distal extremities. Knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes are decreased. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s peripheral neuropathy?,A,"The correct answer is A. Inhibition of beta-tubulin polymerization.

Vincristine, a chemotherapeutic agent, is known to cause peripheral neuropathy as a side effect. The mechanism of this neuropathy is due to the inhibition of beta-tubulin polymerization, which disrupts the formation of microtubules in neurons. This leads to axonal degeneration and damage to the peripheral nerves, resulting in numbness, tingling, and decreased sensation.

The other options are not directly related to vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy:

B. Creation of free radicals that unwind DNA is a mechanism of action for some chemotherapeutic agents, but not vincristine.

C. Inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase is a mechanism of action for methotrexate, a different chemotherapeutic agent.

D. Formation of cross-links between strands of DNA is a mechanism of action for alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide.

She is at the 2ndpercentile for height and 35th percentile for weight. Breast development is Tanner stage 2. Pubic and axillary hair is absent. An x-ray of the left hand and wrist shows a bone age of 11 years. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Reassurance and follow-up.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a normal variant short stature, which is a common condition where a child's height is below average but still within the normal range. The patient's father had a similar growth pattern, and the patient's bone age is consistent with her chronological age. The patient is also developing normally, with breast development at Tanner stage 2.

There is no indication for genetic karyotyping (A) as the patient's symptoms do not suggest a chromosomal abnormality. Pelvic ultrasound (B) is not necessary as the patient is not showing any signs of precocious puberty. Measuring serum dehydroepiandrosterone levels (C) is not relevant to the patient's short stature. An MRI of the brain (E) is not indicated as there is no suspicion of a brain tumor or other central nervous system disorder affecting growth.

The renal biopsy would likely show minimal changes or normal light microscopy findings, which is a hallmark of minimal change disease, a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children.",Success
"A 60-year-old man is referred to a dermatologist by his family physician for management of a rare case of dermatitis that has not responded to standard therapy with corticosteroids. The patient’s medical history is unremarkable, and he is currently working reduced hours at his job as an accountant. Physical examination reveals confluent scaly patches, plaques, and generalized erythroderma along the torso and lower extremities (see image). There is also a solid skin lesion with a diameter greater than 1 cm. The dermatologist suspects a malignancy and orders a biopsy. Which of the following is the most accurate description of this condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Tumor arising from cutaneous T cells.

The description of the patient's symptoms, including confluent scaly patches, plaques, and generalized erythroderma, along with the presence of a solid skin lesion, is consistent with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). CTCL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the skin and is characterized by the proliferation of malignant T cells in the skin. The most common subtype of CTCL is mycosis fungoides, which often presents with scaly patches, plaques, and tumors on the skin.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because she has been feeling very stressed over the past several months. During this period, she has found it difficult to relax. She states that her head is full of worries. She works at an accountant's office and reports difficulty in concentrating on her work. She has been working longer shifts because one of her coworkers is on vacation and reports feeling more tired than usual. She is married and frequently fights with her husband. The patient states that in order to deal with her stress, she goes shopping. While shopping, she steals small trivial items and feels immediately relieved thereafter. She discards the objects she steals and has feelings of shame and guilt about her actions. Her husband is concerned about her behavior, but she is unable to stop shoplifting. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person, place, and time. She reports feeling anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Cognitive behavioral therapy.

The patient's symptoms and behavior are consistent with kleptomania, a disorder characterized by recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal objects that are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value. The patient's feelings of anxiety, stress, and guilt, as well as her inability to stop shoplifting despite her husband's concerns, are all indicative of kleptomania.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that is effective in treating kleptomania. CBT helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to their symptoms. In this case, CBT would help the patient identify the triggers for her shoplifting behavior, such as stress and anxiety, and develop alternative coping mechanisms to manage these feelings.

While psychodynamic psychotherapy (option C) may also be helpful in exploring the underlying causes of the patient's behavior, CBT is a more targeted and effective approach for treating kleptomania. Interpersonal therapy (option B) is not specifically indicated for kleptomania, and motivational interviewing (option E) is typically used for substance abuse disorders. Lithium (option A) is a medication used to treat bipolar disorder and is not indicated for kleptomania.",Success
"A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a change in his behavior over the past few months. Initially, the patient was noted to be behaving inappropriately including using foul language and grabbing people unexpectedly. This has progressed to a worsening of his memory and trouble caring for himself. His temperature is 98.1°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 162/103 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an elderly man who laughs inappropriately at times and who is a poor historian. When he is engaged in conversation, he exhibits word finding difficulty and is rather inattentive. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Frontotemporal dementia.

The patient's symptoms, such as inappropriate behavior, language disturbances, and lack of empathy, are consistent with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). FTD is a group of disorders that affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, leading to changes in personality, behavior, and language. The patient's symptoms, including the use of foul language, grabbing people unexpectedly, and laughing inappropriately, are characteristic of the behavioral variant of FTD.

Alzheimer dementia (A) typically presents with memory impairment and cognitive decline, but not the same level of behavioral changes seen in this patient. Kluver-Bucy syndrome (C) is a rare condition that results from damage to the temporal lobes, leading to hypersexuality, hypermetamorphosis, and other symptoms not seen in this patient. Lewy body dementia (D) is characterized by fluctuations in cognition, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonian symptoms, which are not prominent in this patient. Vascular dementia (E) is caused by cerebrovascular disease and typically presents with a stepwise decline in cognitive function, which is not consistent with this patient's symptoms.",Success
"An 11-month-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother for a rash on his trunk, which he has had for the past 2 days. She notes that he is eating less and is more cranky than usual. His birth history is insignificant, and his immunizations are up to date. Vital signs include: temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 98/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. The rash features thin-walled, fluid-filled blisters that rupture easily. Fluid samples from the lesions are sent for analysis to a microbiology lab. The results reveal an infection by the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is diagnosed with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Which of the following is involved with the primary defense in response to the bacteria and toxins produced by this organism?",E,"The correct answer is D. Immunoglobulin- IgA.

Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a toxin-mediated disease caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The primary defense against this organism and its toxins is the mucosal immune system, which involves IgA antibodies. IgA is the primary immunoglobulin found in mucosal surfaces, such as the skin and respiratory tract, and plays a key role in neutralizing toxins and preventing bacterial colonization.

IgG (Option A) is involved in the secondary immune response and provides long-term immunity against infections. IgE (Option B) is involved in allergic reactions and is not primarily involved in defense against bacterial infections. IgD (Option C) is found on the surface of mature B cells and helps activate the immune response, but it is not directly involved in defense against S. aureus. IgM (Option E) is the first antibody produced in response to an infection, but it is not the primary defense against S. aureus toxins.",Success

An x-ray of the chest shows patchy infiltrates in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?""",A,"The correct answer is A. Levofloxacin.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease, a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila. The patient's symptoms include dry cough, shortness of breath, low-grade fever, and diarrhea, which are consistent with Legionnaires' disease. The laboratory results show hyponatremia (low sodium levels), which is a common finding in Legionnaires' disease. The chest x-ray shows patchy infiltrates in both lungs, which is also consistent with the diagnosis.

Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is effective against Legionella pneumophila and is a recommended treatment for Legionnaires' disease. The other options are not as likely to be effective against Legionella pneumophila:

* Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (B) is effective against Pneumocystis jirovecii, which causes pneumocystis pneumonia, but not against Legionella pneumophila.
* Amoxicillin (C) is a beta-lactam antibiotic that is not effective against Legionella pneumophila.
* Oseltamivir (D) is an antiviral medication that is effective against influenza, but not against bacterial infections like Legionnaires' disease.

Theca lutein cysts.

The description of the ovarian findings, specifically the presence of multiple thin-walled, septated cysts with clear content, is consistent with theca lutein cysts. These cysts are a common finding in molar pregnancies, which is supported by the ultrasound findings of an intrauterine heteroechoic mass with numerous anechoic spaces and no identifiable fetus or amniotic fluid. Theca lutein cysts are thought to be caused by the high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) produced by the molar pregnancy, which stimulate the ovaries to produce multiple cysts.",Success
"A 75-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her son because of a 2-day history of fever, headache, malaise, and dry cough.

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the son being free of symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Serum antibodies against hemagglutinin.

The virus described in the question is likely influenza, which has a helical capsid and a segmented genome. The son's lack of symptoms suggests that he may have been previously exposed to the virus and has developed immunity. The most likely explanation for this is that he has serum antibodies against the hemagglutinin protein, which is a major antigenic component of the influenza virus. These antibodies would provide protection against infection.",Success

After the examination, the patient starts screaming and tries to bite the physician. Urine toxicology screening is positive for ethyl glucuronide. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?""",E,"The correct answer is E. Synthetic cathinone intoxication.

The patient's symptoms, including agitation, paranoia, dilated pupils, hyperreflexia, and cold extremities, are consistent with synthetic cathinone (bath salts) intoxication. The patient's history of attending a party and the presence of ethyl glucuronide in the urine (a metabolite of ethanol) suggest that he may have used substances at the party, including synthetic cathinones.

Brief psychotic disorder (A) is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a toxic or substance-induced psychosis. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (B) is also unlikely, as the patient is not taking neuroleptic medications and does not have a fever or muscle rigidity. Anticholinergic toxicity (C) is possible, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a sympathomimetic toxidrome, such as synthetic cathinone intoxication. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) intoxication (D) is also possible, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with synthetic cathinone intoxication.",Success

Upon further questioning, he reports that he took more medication four hours ago because he was hearing voices. Which of the following should most likely be administered to this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Benztropine.

The patient's symptoms, including neck stiffness, inability to move his neck, and contraction of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, are consistent with acute dystonic reaction, a known side effect of antipsychotic medications. The patient's history of schizophrenia and taking an unknown medication suggests that he may be taking an antipsychotic. Benztropine is an anticholinergic medication that is commonly used to treat acute dystonic reactions. It can help relieve the muscle spasms and stiffness associated with this condition.",Success
"A 13-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. Physical examination shows hepatosplenomegaly. A venous blood sample obtained for routine screening tests is milky. After refrigeration, a creamy supernatant layer appears on top of the sample. Genetic analysis shows a mutation in the apolipoprotein C-II gene (APOC2) on chromosome 19. This patient is at greatest risk for developing which of the following complications?",A,"The correct answer is A. Acute pancreatitis.

The patient's symptoms, including hepatosplenomegaly and a milky venous blood sample that forms a creamy supernatant layer after refrigeration, are consistent with chylomicronemia syndrome, a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of lipoprotein lipase or its cofactor, apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2). This deficiency leads to the accumulation of chylomicrons in the blood, causing hypertriglyceridemia.

One of the major complications of chylomicronemia syndrome is acute pancreatitis, which occurs in up to 20% of patients. The high levels of triglycerides in the blood can cause inflammation of the pancreas, leading to pancreatitis.

The other options are not directly related to chylomicronemia syndrome:

B. Myocardial infarction: While high triglyceride levels may contribute to cardiovascular disease, it is not a direct complication of chylomicronemia syndrome.

C. Corneal arci: This is a sign of hyperlipidemia, but it is not a specific complication of chylomicronemia syndrome.

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient?""",D,"The correct answer is D. Administer calcium gluconate.

The patient's symptoms, including perioral numbness, upper-extremity muscle cramping, and spasm of the hand, are consistent with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels). The patient's recent total thyroidectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery increase the risk of hypocalcemia due to parathyroid gland injury or malabsorption of calcium. The patient's parathyroid hormone level is elevated, indicating that the parathyroid glands are responding to low calcium levels, but are unable to normalize them.

Administering calcium gluconate is the most appropriate initial step in managing this patient's symptoms. Rehydration therapy (option C) may be necessary, but it is not the primary concern. Abdominal CT (option A) is not indicated, as the patient's abdominal symptoms are likely related to the hypocalcemia rather than an underlying abdominal pathology. Observation only (option B) is not sufficient, as the patient's symptoms require prompt treatment. Vitamin D supplementation (option E) may be necessary in the long term, but it will not immediately address the patient's acute symptoms.",Success

Plasma renin activity 10 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5–3.3 ng/mL/hr)
Plasma aldosterone concentration 20 ng/dL (normal, 2–9 ng/dL)
What is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Bartter's syndrome.

The patient's symptoms, such as generalized weakness, increased urination, and increased thirst, are consistent with a diagnosis of Bartter's syndrome. The presence of frequent episodes of constipation since birth and the patient's preference for salty foods also support this diagnosis.

The laboratory results, including the low potassium level, elevated plasma renin activity, and elevated plasma aldosterone concentration, are also consistent with Bartter's syndrome. The elevated urinary calcium excretion is another characteristic feature of this condition.

Bartter's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the kidneys and leads to excessive loss of potassium and sodium in the urine. It is characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and elevated plasma renin and aldosterone levels.

Primary hyperaldosteronism (option B) is unlikely because it typically presents with hypertension, which is not seen in this patient. Renal artery stenosis (option A) is also unlikely because it typically presents with hypertension and would not explain the patient's hypokalemia and elevated plasma renin and aldosterone levels. Pheochromocytoma (option D) is unlikely because it typically presents with hypertension, tachycardia, and other symptoms not seen in this patient.

Physical examination reveals slight jaundice and pale conjunctiva. The spleen is tender and easily palpable. After a complete blood count with differential and an abdominal ultrasound, the patient is found to have sickle-cell disease with splenic infarct. A partial splenectomy is performed. After the operation, the physician provides vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The picture shows a slide obtained from the resected portion of the patient’s spleen. Dysfunction of the zone marked with which number predisposes the patient to the aforementioned infections?",D,"The correct answer is D. 1 and 2.

The image shows a slide of the spleen, and the zones marked are:

1. White pulp (lymphoid tissue)
2. Red pulp (filtration beds)

The white pulp (zone 1) contains immune cells that help fight infections, and the red pulp (zone 2) is responsible for filtering the blood and removing pathogens.

In this case, the patient has sickle-cell disease, which leads to splenic dysfunction, particularly in the red pulp (zone 2). The spleen's inability to filter the blood properly increases the risk of infections, especially with encapsulated bacteria like Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The white pulp (zone 1) is also affected, as it is responsible for mounting an immune response to infections. The dysfunction of both zones 1 and 2 predisposes the patient to these infections, which is why the physician provides vaccines against these specific pathogens.

Zone 3 is not directly related to the patient's increased risk of infections.",Success

He has smoked 20–30 cigarettes daily for the past 26 years. Anti-glomerular basement membrane serologies are positive. Which of the following is a specific feature for this patient’s condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Linear IgG staining on immunofluorescence.

The patient's symptoms and positive anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) serologies suggest a diagnosis of Goodpasture's syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the production of antibodies against the GBM. A specific feature of Goodpasture's syndrome is the linear deposition of IgG along the GBM, which can be seen on immunofluorescence microscopy.

The other options are not specific to Goodpasture's syndrome:

A. Granulomatous inflammation and necrotizing vasculitis are features of Wegener's granulomatosis, a different autoimmune disease.

The pathogen isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be cultured on Sabouraud agar. Further evaluation of this patient's CSF is most likely to show which of the following additional findings?",A,"The correct answer is A. Positive latex agglutination test.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with meningitis, and the isolation of a pathogen that can be cultured on Sabouraud agar suggests that the causative agent is Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus that commonly causes meningitis in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV infection. The latex agglutination test is a diagnostic test that detects the presence of cryptococcal antigen in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which would be positive in this case.

The other options are not correct because:

B. HSV-2 is a virus that causes genital herpes, not meningitis.

C. Tachyzoites are a stage in the life cycle of Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite that can cause toxoplasmosis, but it is not typically associated with meningitis in HIV-infected individuals.

Examination shows a long erythematous rash covered with multiple clear vesicles and crusty lesions extending from her back to below her right breast. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of the disease?",A,"The correct answer is A. Viral reactivation in dorsal root ganglia.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with shingles (herpes zoster), which is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus in the dorsal root ganglia.

"A type of fatal adrenal cancer has an average survival rate of 3 years after the onset of clinically significant symptoms. It is determined that patients have a 4-year asymptomatic period prior to developing clinical symptoms from this adrenal cancer. A new screening test is developed, and the cancer can now be detected 2 years prior to developing clinical symptoms. A new observational case-control study of screened and unscreened patients measures the median 5-year survival of patients who decline medical and surgical treatment. The screened population has statistically better outcomes. Which step should be undertaken to prevent bias in these conclusions?",B,"The correct answer is B. Using mortality rates in the analysis.

The study is prone to lead-time bias, which occurs when a screening test detects a disease earlier than it would have been diagnosed clinically, but does not change the natural course of the disease. In this case, the screening test detects the cancer 2 years prior to developing clinical symptoms, which may artificially inflate the survival rate of the screened population.

To prevent this bias, the study should use mortality rates instead of survival rates. Mortality rates are less susceptible to lead-time bias, as they measure the proportion of patients who die from the disease, rather than the time from diagnosis to death. By using mortality rates, the study can get a more accurate estimate of the effect of screening on patient outcomes.",Success

"A 43-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her brother for severe chest pain. The patient recently lost her husband in a car accident and is still extremely shocked by the event. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 105/67 mm Hg, the heart rate is 96/min and regular, breathing rate is 23/min, and the pulse oximetry is 96%. An S3 heart sound and rales in the lower right and left lung lobes are heard. A 12-lead ECG shows no significant findings. Echocardiography shows an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium. The patient is stabilized and informed about the diagnosis and possible treatment options. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as severe chest pain, S3 heart sound, and rales in the lung lobes, suggest a cardiac condition. The echocardiography results showing an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium are also consistent with a cardiac diagnosis.

The patient's recent emotional trauma, specifically the loss of her husband, is a key factor in the diagnosis. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as broken heart syndrome, is a condition in which intense emotional stress can cause reversible left ventricular dysfunction. It is often seen in postmenopausal women and can present with symptoms similar to a myocardial infarction, such as chest pain and electrocardiographic changes. The other options do not fit the patient's presentation and diagnosis as well as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.",Success

On physical exam, the unconscious man is covered in bloody vomit with small clots and food particles. He smells of alcohol. A digital exam reveals black tarry stool in the rectal vault. The patient is given oxygen, IV fluids, and an NG-tube is placed and set to intermittent suction. Labs are sent and the patient is prepared for a procedure. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in his management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Undergo upper GI endoscopy.

The patient's symptoms, including bloody vomit, black tarry stool, and a history of alcoholism, suggest upper gastrointestinal bleeding, likely from a peptic ulcer. Upper GI endoscopy is the most appropriate next step to visualize the upper GI tract, identify the source of bleeding, and potentially perform therapeutic interventions such as cauterization or clipping to control the bleeding.",Success
"An 8-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of hematuria. Two weeks ago, she had a sore throat that resolved without treatment. Physical examination shows 1+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Urinalysis shows numerous RBCs and 3+ proteinuria. Her antistreptolysin O titer is elevated. Formation of which of the following is most likely involved in the underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Antigen-antibody complexes.

The patient's symptoms, including hematuria, proteinuria, and edema, are consistent with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). PSGN is an immune complex-mediated disease that occurs after a streptococcal infection, such as the sore throat the patient had two weeks prior. The elevated antistreptolysin O titer suggests that the patient had a recent streptococcal infection.

In PSGN, the immune system produces antibodies against the streptococcal antigens, and these antibodies form immune complexes with the antigens. These immune complexes then deposit in the glomeruli of the kidneys, causing inflammation and damage, which leads to the symptoms seen in the patient.

The other options are not directly related to the underlying mechanism of PSGN:

A. Antigen-specific IgE binding to mast cells is involved in allergic reactions, not PSGN.

B. Tissue-specific antibodies are involved in autoimmune diseases, not PSGN.

C. Presensitized CD4+ helper T-cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, not PSGN.

E. Presensitized CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells are involved in cell-mediated immunity, not PSGN.",Success
"A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. He was found down in the middle of the street. His past medical history is unknown. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 104/64 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 5/min, and oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. The patient is being resuscitated in the trauma bay. Which of the following was most likely to be found on exam?",C,"The correct answer is C. Miosis.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the altered mental status and slow respiratory rate, suggest opioid overdose. Opioids can cause respiratory depression, which can lead to altered mental status. The patient's vital signs, including a normal temperature, blood pressure, and pulse, also support this diagnosis.

On physical examination, opioid overdose is often associated with miosis (pinpoint pupils), which is a classic sign of opioid toxicity. The other options are not typically associated with opioid overdose:

A. Ataxia is a symptom of cerebellar dysfunction, which is not typically seen in opioid overdose.

B. Conjunctival injection is a sign of eye irritation or inflammation, which is not related to opioid overdose.

D. Mydriasis (dilated pupils) is the opposite of miosis and is not typically seen in opioid overdose.

E. Nystagmus is a sign of vestibular dysfunction, which is not typically seen in opioid overdose.

"A 38-year-old G4P3 presents to her obstetrician’s office for her 20-week anatomy ultrasound. She reports that she feels well and has not experienced any contractions or vaginal bleeding. She also reports good fetal movement. The patient declined prenatal screening earlier in the pregnancy for religious reasons but would now like an anatomy ultrasound to ensure the fetus is growing appropriately. The patient’s previous pregnancies were uncomplicated, and she delivered three healthy babies at full term. On the ultrasound, the technician observes a male fetus with likely intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). She also notes microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, and clenched fists with overlapping fingers. The technician further notes a medium-sized ventricular septal defect (VSD). The amniotic fluid index (AFI) is 26 cm.

Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be observed in this fetus?",D,"The correct answer is D. Prominent occiput.

The ultrasound findings described, including microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and ventricular septal defect (VSD), are consistent with a diagnosis of trisomy 21, also known as Down syndrome.

"An 83-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with fever, weakness, and decreased responsiveness. He is diagnosed with urosepsis based on urinalysis and culture and started on ceftriaxone and intravenous fluids. By hospital day 3, he is clinically improving. During the evening, the patient becomes irritable. He is talking to someone despite nobody being present in the room. He is easily agitated and attempts to strike a nurse with a remote control to his TV. Subsequently, the patient keeps getting out of bed and trying to walk away despite being a fall risk. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Olanzapine.

The patient is exhibiting symptoms of delirium, a common complication in hospitalized elderly patients. The symptoms include irritability, agitation, hallucinations, and disorientation. Olanzapine is an antipsychotic medication that is often used to treat delirium in hospitalized patients. It can help to reduce agitation, aggression, and hallucinations.

Diphenhydramine (A) is an antihistamine that can cause sedation, but it is not typically used to treat delirium. Lorazepam (B) is a benzodiazepine that can be used to treat anxiety or seizures, but it can worsen delirium in elderly patients. Phenobarbital (D) is a barbiturate that can be used to treat seizures, but it is not typically used to treat delirium.

"A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, weight loss, and muscle aches during the past 2 months. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. Her only medication is a multivitamin. A metyrapone stimulation test is performed and the results rule out a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Which of the following changes in laboratory findings are most likely to have been observed in this patient following the administration of the drug?",A,"The correct answer is A. Increase in serum ACTH.

Metyrapone is a medication that inhibits the enzyme 11β-hydroxylase, which is necessary for the production of cortisol in the adrenal glands. When metyrapone is administered, it blocks the production of cortisol, leading to an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion from the pituitary gland. This is because the pituitary gland senses the decrease in cortisol levels and responds by increasing ACTH production to stimulate the adrenal glands to produce more cortisol.

The other options are not correct:

B. Urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids would actually increase, not decrease, because metyrapone shunts the production of cortisol towards the 17-hydroxycorticosteroid pathway.

C. Serum 11-deoxycortisol would increase, not decrease, because metyrapone blocks the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol.

D. Serum cortisol would decrease, not increase, because metyrapone inhibits cortisol production.

E. Urine metanephrines are not directly related to the effects of metyrapone on cortisol production.",Success
An investigator conducts a study to determine whether earlier detection of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in patients increases survival time. One subset of study participants consists of asymptomatic individuals who were diagnosed with GBM after undergoing a screening MRI of the brain. The other subset of study participants was diagnosed with GBM only after they developed symptoms. Results from the study show that the asymptomatic patients who were diagnosed with screening MRI had an average survival time that was 6 weeks longer than that of the patients who were diagnosed after symptom onset. Which of the following statistical biases is most likely to have occurred as a result of the endpoint selected for this study?,E,"The correct answer is E. Lead-time bias.

Lead-time bias occurs when a screening test detects a disease earlier than it would have been diagnosed clinically, but does not actually change the course of the disease or improve outcomes. In this study, the asymptomatic patients who were diagnosed with screening MRI had an average survival time that was 6 weeks longer than that of the patients who were diagnosed after symptom onset. This apparent increase in survival time may be due to the fact that the screening MRI detected the disease earlier, rather than any actual improvement in survival. This is an example of lead-time bias.",Success
"A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 25 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which he was the restrained driver. On questioning by the paramedics, he reported severe chest pain and mild dyspnea. On arrival, he is confused and unable to provide a history.

He is able to move his extremities in response to commands. He opens his eyes spontaneously. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Examination shows multiple bruises over the trunk and extremities. There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) wound at the left fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. There is jugular venous distention. Decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance on percussion are noted on the left. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Needle decompression.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a tension pneumothorax, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment. The signs of tension pneumothorax include jugular venous distention, decreased breath sounds, and hyperresonance on percussion on the affected side (in this case, the left side). The patient's hypotension and tachypnea also support this diagnosis.

Needle decompression is the most appropriate next step in management, as it can quickly relieve the tension in the chest cavity and improve the patient's respiratory and cardiovascular status. This should be followed by insertion of a chest tube to drain the pneumothorax and prevent recurrence.

The other options are not correct because:

A. CT scan of the chest would take too long and is not necessary to diagnose a tension pneumothorax.

B. Bronchoscopy is not indicated in this scenario and would not address the patient's immediate life-threatening condition.

C. Emergency thoracotomy may be necessary if the patient's condition deteriorates further, but it is not the initial step in management.

E. X-ray of the chest may show the pneumothorax, but it would not provide immediate relief and would delay treatment.",Success
"A novel type of PET radiotracer is being developed to evaluate patients with Parkinson’s disease. A clinical research study has enrolled 1,200 patients, half of whom have the disease. The scan is found to be positive in 590 of the 600 patients with known PD, and positive in 20 of the 600 patients without PD. What is the test’s overall specificity?",E,"The correct answer is E. 580 / (580 + 20).

To calculate the specificity of the test, you need to know the number of true negatives (patients without PD who test negative) and the number of false positives (patients without PD who test positive).

In this case, there are 600 patients without PD, and 20 of them test positive, so there are 600 - 20 = 580 true negatives.

The specificity is then calculated as the number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives:

Specificity = 580 / (580 + 20) = 580 / 600 = 0.967 or 96.7%

So, the correct answer is E. 580 / (580 + 20).",Success

The patient’s knees are enlarged, bilaterally, and he has pain and crepitus on passive range of motion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Osteoarthritis.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with osteoarthritis:

* Bilateral wrist and knee pain, which are common joints affected by osteoarthritis
* Morning stiffness lasting around 50 minutes, which is a common feature of osteoarthritis
* Non-tender nodules on the distal interphalangeal joints, which are likely Heberden's nodes, a characteristic feature of osteoarthritis
* Tenderness at the base of both thumbs, which could indicate osteoarthritis of the first carpometacarpal joints
* Enlarged knees with pain and crepitus on passive range of motion, which suggests osteoarthritis of the knees

The other options are less likely:

* Ankylosing spondylitis (A) typically affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, and is less likely to cause bilateral wrist and knee pain.
* Rheumatoid arthritis (B) often causes joint swelling, morning stiffness lasting longer than 1 hour, and systemic symptoms, which are not present in this patient.
* Gout (C) typically causes acute, severe joint pain and swelling, often in a single joint, which is not consistent with this patient's symptoms.

What other finding will most likely be seen in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is A. Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion.

The patient has a left C5 hemicord lesion, which means that the lesion is affecting the left side of the spinal cord at the C5 level. This type of lesion typically causes a Brown-Sequard syndrome, which is characterized by:

* Ipsilateral (same side) weakness and spasticity at the level of the lesion (in this case, left-sided weakness)
* Ipsilateral loss of proprioception and vibration below the level of the lesion
* Contralateral (opposite side) loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of the lesion

He is sexually active with one female partner and does not use condoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a tender right testicle; lifting it provides relief. The penis appears normal, with no discharge at the meatus. Laboratory studies show a normal complete blood count; urinalysis shows 3 WBC/hpf. A Gram stain of a urethral swab shows polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no organisms. Testicular ultrasound shows increased blood flow to the right testicle compared to the left. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Chlamydia trachomatis infection.

The patient's symptoms, including right-sided scrotal pain, burning sensation on urination, and increased urinary frequency, are consistent with epididymitis, which is an inflammation of the epididymis, a tube-like structure behind the testicle that stores sperm. The physical examination findings, including a tender right testicle and relief of pain with elevation, also support this diagnosis.

The laboratory studies, including a normal complete blood count and urinalysis with 3 WBC/hpf, suggest an inflammatory process rather than an infectious one. The Gram stain of a urethral swab showing polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no organisms is also consistent with epididymitis.

The testicular ultrasound showing increased blood flow to the right testicle compared to the left suggests inflammation and rules out testicular torsion, which would show decreased blood flow.

Chlamydia trachomatis is a common cause of epididymitis in sexually active young men, and the patient's history of being sexually active with one female partner and not using condoms makes this diagnosis likely. Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection (Option A) is also a possible cause of epididymitis, but the Gram stain would likely show gram-negative diplococci. Treponema pallidum infection (Option C) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Testicular tumor (Option B) is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, and varicocele (Option E) is a condition characterized by abnormal dilation of the veins in the scrotum, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.",Success

The blood smear shows hypochromia, poikilocytosis, and large platelets, while a platelet aggregation test with ristocetin is normal. The overall bleeding time is increased. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is D. Bernard-Soulier disease.

The patient's symptoms, including nose bleeding, bruising, and petechiae, suggest a bleeding disorder. The complete blood count shows a normal platelet count, but the blood smear reveals large platelets, which is a characteristic feature of Bernard-Soulier disease. The platelet aggregation test with ristocetin is normal, which rules out von Willebrand disease. The increased bleeding time and normal coagulation test results suggest a platelet function disorder rather than a coagulation disorder. Glanzmann's thrombasthenia is also a possibility, but the presence of large platelets on the blood smear makes Bernard-Soulier disease more likely.

A genetic workup reveals that she has an inherited condition. What is the most likely pathophysiology of this patient’s condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Resistance to clotting factor degradation.

The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest a diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and the genetic workup reveals an inherited condition. The most likely pathophysiology is resistance to activated protein C (APC), which is a clotting factor degradation disorder. This is a common inherited thrombophilia, also known as factor V Leiden mutation. It leads to an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, as seen in this patient.

"A previously healthy 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for evaluation of an abdominal mass noticed a few days ago. He appears markedly pale and lethargic. Examination shows a 6-cm, nonmobile mass in the left upper quadrant that crosses the midline. 24-hour urine collection shows elevated homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid. Further evaluation including biopsy confirms the diagnosis of intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. The physician recommends the established standard treatment, which is initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, the likelihood of unresectability without neoadjuvant treatment, and the prognosis without it, the patient's parents steadily refuse chemotherapy because they do not want their son to suffer the side effects. They prefer to take their son home for supportive care only. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?",D,"The correct answer is D. Seek a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

In this scenario, the parents are refusing a life-saving treatment for their child, which is a serious and potentially fatal condition. The physician has a duty to act in the best interests of the child, and chemotherapy is the established standard treatment for intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. The parents' refusal of chemotherapy puts the child at risk of significant harm or even death.

While it is important to respect the parents' autonomy and involve them in the decision-making process, the physician's primary responsibility is to the child's well-being. In this case, seeking a court order to ensure the child receives necessary medical treatment is the most appropriate action.

On exam, she appears well-nourished with a BMI of 21 kg/m^2, but you note that she has enlarged cheeks bilaterally and has calluses on the dorsum of her hands. She says that she has been very stressed with school and has recently been binge eating. What other finding do you expect to see in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Erosion of tooth enamel.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with bulimia nervosa, a eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging or compensatory behaviors. The calluses on the dorsum of her hands are likely due to self-induced vomiting, and the enlarged cheeks are likely due to swelling of the salivary glands. Erosion of tooth enamel is a common finding in patients with bulimia nervosa due to the frequent exposure to stomach acid during vomiting.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings:

A. Malar rash is a butterfly-shaped rash on the face that is often seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.

B. Increased blood glucose level may be seen in patients with diabetes, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings.

D. Enlarged thyroid may be seen in patients with hyperthyroidism, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings.

E. Elevated estrogen levels may be seen in patients with certain hormonal imbalances, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings.",Success
"A 23-year-old college student presents to the clinic with a history of intermittent chest discomfort. He reports that, about once per month for the past 8 or 9 months, he's had episodes of ""feeling like my chest is going to explode."" During these episodes, he also feels shortness of breath, feels shakiness throughout his arms and legs, and sweats so heavily that he needs to change his shirt. He is unsure of any clear precipitating factors but thinks they may occur more often around important exams or when big school projects are due. He shares that, as these episodes continue to recur, he has had mounting anxiety about having one when he is in class or at a restaurant. As a result, he is leaving the house less and less. He has no past medical history; the physical exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is the best medication for the long-term management of this patient's condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Citalopram.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with panic disorder, which is characterized by recurrent panic attacks, anxiety about having future attacks, and avoidance of situations where attacks may occur. The patient's physical symptoms, such as chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and shakiness, are typical of panic attacks. The fact that the episodes seem to occur more frequently around stressful events, such as exams or projects, also supports this diagnosis.

Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is commonly used to treat panic disorder. It has been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of panic attacks, as well as alleviating anxiety and depression.

Lorazepam (C) is a benzodiazepine that can be used to treat panic disorder, but it is not a good choice for long-term management due to its potential for dependence and withdrawal symptoms.

Propranolol (D) is a beta blocker that can be used to treat performance anxiety, but it is not typically used to treat panic disorder.

Quetiapine (E) is an antipsychotic medication that is not typically used to treat panic disorder.

Lithium (B) is a mood stabilizer that is not typically used to treat panic disorder.

Therefore, the best medication for the long-term management of this patient's condition is citalopram (A).",Success

"Please refer to the summary above to answer this question
The authors of the study have decided to conduct a follow-up analysis on their data. They decide to stratify their results by CD4+T-lymphocyte count at the time of diagnosis. Among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, cART adherence was a significant predictor of DLBCL risk (RR = 0.52, p = 0.01). However, among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3, no relationship was found between DLBCL risk and cART adherence (RR = 0.96, p = 0.36). Which of the following explains for the difference observed between the two strata?""",E,"The correct answer is E. Effect modification.

The difference in the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk between the two strata (CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3 and above 200/mm3) suggests that the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk is modified by the CD4+ cell count at the time of diagnosis. In other words, the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk is different depending on the level of CD4+ cell count. This is an example of effect modification, where the effect of an exposure (cART adherence) on an outcome (DLBCL risk) is influenced by a third variable (CD4+ cell count).",Success
"During a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, Th1 cells secrete a factor capable of stimulating phagosome-lysosome fusion within macrophages. In addition, the secreted factors help activate macrophages to produce mediators such as NO, which are capable of destroying the invading pathogen. Furthermore, activation of the macrophages by the secreted factor eventually leads to the formation of a tubercle. Which of the following factors is secreted by Th1 cells and responsible for these actions?",C,"The correct answer is C. IFN-gamma.

Th1 cells secrete IFN-gamma, which plays a crucial role in the immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. IFN-gamma stimulates phagosome-lysosome fusion within macrophages, allowing for the destruction of the bacteria. It also activates macrophages to produce mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), which is toxic to the bacteria. Additionally, IFN-gamma helps to form granulomas, also known as tubercles, which are characteristic of tuberculosis infections.

The other options are not correct:

A. IL-4 is a cytokine secreted by Th2 cells, which is involved in the immune response against parasites and in allergic reactions.

B. TNF-alpha is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that can be secreted by various immune cells, including macrophages and T cells. While it does play a role in the immune response against M. tuberculosis, it is not the primary factor responsible for the actions described.

D. Histamine is a mediator released by mast cells and basophils during allergic reactions, and is not involved in the immune response against M. tuberculosis.

E. IL-17 is a cytokine secreted by Th17 cells, which is involved in the immune response against extracellular bacteria and fungi. While it does play a role in the immune response against certain pathogens, it is not the primary factor responsible for the actions described in the context of M. tuberculosis infection.",Success
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician because of abdominal pain and constipation for 3 weeks. His mother says he has been increasingly irritable recently. His vocabulary consists of 50 words and he does not use sentences. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae and abdominal tenderness. He refers to himself by name but is unable to name body parts or count to three. Peripheral blood smear shows small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling. Which of the following processes is most likely impaired in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest lead poisoning, which is supported by the presence of basophilic stippling on the peripheral blood smear. Basophilic stippling is a characteristic feature of lead poisoning and is caused by the inhibition of the enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), which is necessary for the conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen in the heme biosynthetic pathway. This inhibition leads to the accumulation of aminolevulinic acid and the formation of basophilic stippling in red blood cells.",Success
"A group of researchers conducted a study to determine whether there is an association between folic acid supplementation before pregnancy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. The researchers retrospectively surveyed 200 mothers with children diagnosed with ASD during the first 4 years of life and 200 mothers with healthy children. All participants were interviewed about their prenatal consumption of folic acid using standardized questionnaires. A 94% response rate was obtained from the surveys. The study ultimately found that folic acid supplementation was associated with lower rates of ASD in offspring (OR = 0.3, p < 0.01). Which of the following type of bias is most likely to have influenced these results?",C,"The correct answer is C. Recall bias.

The study is a retrospective study, where mothers are asked to recall their prenatal consumption of folic acid using standardized questionnaires. This type of study design is prone to recall bias, which occurs when participants' memories of past events or exposures are inaccurate or incomplete. In this case, mothers of children with ASD may be more likely to remember or report not taking folic acid supplements during pregnancy, while mothers of healthy children may be more likely to remember or report taking folic acid supplements. This bias could lead to an overestimation of the association between folic acid supplementation and lower rates of ASD.",Success
"A student studying pharmacology is a member of a team that is conducting research related to the elimination of multiple anticoagulant medications. His duty as a member of the team is to collect serum samples of the subjects every 4 hours and send them for analysis of serum drug levels. He is also supposed to collect, document and analyze the data. For one of the subjects, he notices that the subject is eliminating 0.5 mg of the drug every 4 hours. Which of the following anticoagulants did this patient most likely consume?",A,"The correct answer is C. Dabigatran.

Dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor that has a predictable pharmacokinetic profile, with a half-life of around 12-14 hours. It is eliminated primarily through renal excretion, with approximately 80% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the urine.

The fact that the subject is eliminating 0.5 mg of the drug every 4 hours suggests a first-order elimination process, which is consistent with dabigatran's pharmacokinetics.

Warfarin (A) is a vitamin K antagonist that has a longer half-life (around 36-48 hours) and is eliminated through a different mechanism.

Enoxaparin (B) and fondaparinux (D) are low-molecular-weight heparins that are eliminated primarily through renal excretion, but they have shorter half-lives (around 4-6 hours) and are not typically associated with a predictable elimination rate of 0.5 mg every 4 hours.

Apixaban (E) is a direct factor Xa inhibitor that has a half-life of around 12 hours, but its elimination profile is not consistent with the described pattern.

Therefore, based on the elimination pattern, dabigatran (C) is the most likely anticoagulant consumed by the subject.",Success

Ca2+: 9.0 mg/dL

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Chronic kidney failure.

The patient's laboratory results show a progressive increase in BUN and creatinine levels over the past 4 months, indicating a chronic decline in kidney function. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are also low, suggesting anemia, which is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. The potassium level is elevated, which is also consistent with chronic kidney disease.

There is no evidence of acute kidney injury, such as a sudden increase in creatinine or BUN, to support option A. The patient denies urinary issues, making option B, ascending pyelonephritis, less likely. There is no indication of obstructive uropathy, such as a kidney stone or tumor, to support option D.

"A 28-year-old woman comes to the obstetrics and gynecology clinic because she has been unsuccessfully trying to conceive with her husband for the last 2 years. He has had 2 children from a previous marriage and has been tested for causes of male infertility. She has had prior abdominal surgery as well as a family history of endocrine abnormalities. Based on this history, a panel of tests are obtained and treatment is started. This treatment will be administered intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle. If the most likely drug prescribed in this case was administered in a different manner, which of the following conditions may also be treated by this drug?",E,"The correct answer is C. Polycystic ovarian syndrome.

The scenario described suggests that the woman is being treated for infertility, and the treatment is being administered one week before her normal menstrual cycle. This is consistent with the use of clomiphene citrate, a medication commonly used to stimulate ovulation in women with infertility.

If clomiphene citrate were administered in a different manner, it could also be used to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder that can cause infertility, irregular periods, and other symptoms. Clomiphene citrate is sometimes used to induce ovulation in women with PCOS.

The other options are not directly related to the treatment of infertility or PCOS:

A. Diabetes is a metabolic disorder that is not typically treated with clomiphene citrate.

B. Parkinson disease is a neurological disorder that is not related to clomiphene citrate.

A 2-year-old girl with recurrent urinary tract infections is brought to the physician for a follow-up examination. Renal ultrasound shows bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis. A voiding cystourethrography shows retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition. Histologic examination of a kidney biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?,D,"The correct answer is D. Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy.

The patient's symptoms and test results suggest a diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), which is a condition in which urine flows backward from the bladder into the kidneys, causing damage to the kidneys over time. The renal ultrasound shows bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis, which is consistent with VUR. The voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) shows retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition, which is a hallmark of VUR.

On histologic examination, the kidney biopsy specimen would likely show cortical thinning with tubular atrophy, which is a characteristic finding in chronic reflux nephropathy. This is because the repeated episodes of reflux cause scarring and damage to the kidneys, leading to a decrease in renal function and cortical thinning.

The other options are not directly related to VUR or reflux nephropathy:

A. Diffuse interstitial infiltration with T lymphocytes is more consistent with an acute interstitial nephritis.

B. Glomerular crescents with macrophages are more consistent with a glomerulonephritis, such as post-infectious glomerulonephritis.

C. Matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation is more consistent with a glomerular disease, such as IgA nephropathy.

A 10-year-old Caucasian female with Turner's syndrome underwent an abdominal imaging study and was discovered that the poles of her kidneys were fused inferiorly. Normal ascension of kidney during embryological development would be prevented by which of the following anatomical structures?,C,"The correct answer is B. Superior mesenteric artery.

During embryological development, the kidneys ascend from the pelvis to their normal position in the lumbar region. The superior mesenteric artery, which arises from the abdominal aorta, can prevent the normal ascension of the kidneys by blocking their upward migration. This can result in a horseshoe kidney, where the poles of the kidneys are fused inferiorly.

Which of the following is most likely to result from the action of drug X on the Rb gene?",C,"The correct answer is C. Initiation of S phase.

Here's why:

* Drug X activates cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), which is a key regulator of the cell cycle.
* CDK4 phosphorylates and inactivates the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, a tumor suppressor that normally inhibits cell cycle progression.
* When Rb is inactivated, the cell cycle is allowed to progress from the G1 phase to the S phase, where DNA replication occurs.
* Therefore, the administration of drug X would likely lead to an increase in the number of cells in the S phase, as the cells are able to overcome the G1/S checkpoint and enter the S phase.

* A. G1 phase arrest would occur if the Rb protein were activated, not inactivated.
* B. Prophase I arrest is not related to the Rb gene or CDK4.
* D. Completion of G2 phase is not directly related to the action of drug X on the Rb gene.

"In order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?",E,"The correct answer is A. Lack of a comparison group.

The editor suggested that the study should be submitted as a case series instead of a cohort study because it lacks a comparison group. A cohort study typically involves comparing a group of patients who receive a particular treatment or intervention (in this case, cerclage wiring) to a control group that does not receive the treatment. The study in question only followed a single group of patients who received the treatment, without a control group for comparison. This lack of a comparison group is a key characteristic of a case series, which is a descriptive study that reports on a series of patients with a particular condition or treatment, without comparing them to a control group.",Success
"A 67-year-old woman presents from home hospice with a change in her mental status. She has seemed more confused lately and is unable to verbalize her symptoms. Her temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 117/65 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a right upper quadrant mass that elicits discomfort when palpated. Ultrasound is notable for pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder wall thickening without any gallstones. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Acalculous cholecystitis.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, including a right upper quadrant mass that is tender to palpation, are consistent with acute cholecystitis. The ultrasound findings of pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder wall thickening without gallstones support this diagnosis. Acalculous cholecystitis is a type of acute cholecystitis that occurs in the absence of gallstones, and it is more common in critically ill patients, such as those in hospice care.",Success
A 35-year-old female is brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious. The patient is found to have a blood glucose level of 35 mg/dL. Hgb A1c was found to be 5.1%. C-peptide level was found to be decreased. The patient returned to her baseline after glucose replacement. She states that she has never had an episode like this before. She has no significant past medical history but reports a family history of diabetes in her mother. She states that she has been undergoing a difficult divorce over the past few months. What is the likely cause of this patient's condition?,B,"The correct answer is B. Factitious disorder.

The patient's presentation with hypoglycemia, decreased C-peptide level, and no history of diabetes or other medical conditions suggests that the hypoglycemia is not due to a medical condition. The patient's history of a difficult divorce and the fact that she returned to her baseline after glucose replacement suggests that the hypoglycemia may be self-induced, which is consistent with a factitious disorder. Factitious disorder, also known as Munchausen syndrome, is a psychological disorder in which a person intentionally produces or feigns symptoms of illness in order to gain attention and sympathy. In this case, the patient may have intentionally taken insulin or another hypoglycemic agent to induce hypoglycemia.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to the physician with complaints of increased urinary frequency and decreasing volumes for the past 2 months. He does not complain of any pain during urination. He is frustrated that he has to wake up 2 or 3 times per night to urinate even though he tried reducing the amount of water he consumes before bed and made some other dietary changes without any improvement. He has no family history of prostate disease. Physical examination is negative for any suprapubic mass or tenderness, and there is no costovertebral angle tenderness. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?",D,"The correct answer is A. Urinalysis and serum creatinine.

The patient's symptoms of increased urinary frequency and decreasing volumes suggest a possible underlying urinary tract issue. The first step in evaluating this patient would be to rule out any underlying infection or kidney damage. A urinalysis would help identify any signs of infection, such as bacteria, white blood cells, or protein in the urine. A serum creatinine level would help assess kidney function. This is a more appropriate next step than the other options, which may be important in the evaluation of the patient's symptoms, but are not the best initial step.",Success
"A 48-year-old woman with chronic tension headaches comes to the physician because of several episodes of bilateral flank pain and reddish urine within the past month. Current medications include aspirin, which she takes almost daily for headaches. Her temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F) and her blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg.

There are no casts or dysmorphic RBCs visualized on microscopic analysis of the urine. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's hematuria?""",E,"The correct answer is D. Lipid peroxidation within tubular cells.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest acute kidney injury (AKI) with hematuria, likely caused by analgesic nephropathy. The patient's daily use of aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is the most likely underlying cause of her condition. NSAIDs can cause oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation within tubular cells, leading to tubular damage and AKI. The absence of casts or dysmorphic RBCs on urine microscopy makes glomerular disease (option B) less likely. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest tubular lumen obstruction by protein casts (option A), bacterial infection of the renal parenchyma (option C), or vasoconstriction of the medullary vessels (option E).",Success
"A 37-year-old primigravid woman at 12 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and dull suprapubic pain for 3 hours.

Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 89/65 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a dilated cervical os and a uterus consistent in size with an 11-week gestation. Ultrasonography shows an embryo of 4 cm in crown-rump length and no fetal cardiac activity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Dilation and curettage.

The patient is experiencing vaginal bleeding and suprapubic pain, and the ultrasound shows an embryo with no fetal cardiac activity, indicating a missed abortion. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform a dilation and curettage (D&C) to evacuate the nonviable pregnancy tissue from the uterus. This will help to prevent further bleeding and infection, and allow the patient to physically and emotionally recover from the pregnancy loss.

Misoprostol therapy (Option A) is not indicated in this scenario, as it is typically used to induce labor or treat postpartum hemorrhage, not to manage a missed abortion.

Follow-up ultrasonography (Option B) may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but it is not the next step in management.

Methotrexate therapy (Option C) is used to treat ectopic pregnancies, not missed abortions.

Complete bed rest (Option E) is not a necessary or effective treatment for a missed abortion, and may not prevent further bleeding or complications.",Success
"A 17-year-old female accidentally eats a granola bar manufactured on equipment that processes peanuts. She develops type I hypersensitivity-mediated histamine release, resulting in pruritic wheals on the skin. Which of the following layers of this patient's skin would demonstrate histologic changes on biopsy of her lesions?",E,"The correct answer is E. Dermis.

In type I hypersensitivity reactions, such as the one described, histamine release from mast cells leads to increased permeability of blood vessels and leakage of fluid into the tissues. This results in edema and inflammation in the dermis, which is the layer of skin beneath the epidermis.

The epidermis, which consists of the stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale, is not directly affected by the histamine release and would not show significant histologic changes on biopsy.

The dermis, on the other hand, would show evidence of inflammation, such as edema, vasodilation, and infiltration of immune cells, which would be visible on biopsy.",Success

A small nasal polyp is also present on inspection. Which of the following is the most likely cause for the girl’s symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Dysfunction in a transmembrane regulator.

The symptoms described, including persistent cough, fever, vomiting, and recurrent pneumonia, are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). The presence of a nasal polyp and foul-smelling stools also support this diagnosis. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a dysfunction in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which regulates the transport of salt and water in and out of cells. This leads to thick, sticky mucus that clogs the airways and digestive tract, causing the symptoms described.",Success

He is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. He denies any use of illicit drugs. The vital signs are as follows: heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.6°C (99.68°F), and blood pressure 132/70 mm Hg. The physical examination is significant for inspiratory crackles over the lung bases. An echocardiogram shows a normal ejection fraction. A chest radiograph is performed and shown below. Which of the following findings will most likely be noted on spirometry?",D,"The correct answer is D. Decreased FEV1 and FVC with normal FEV1/FVC ratio.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest interstitial lung disease, which is a known side effect of amiodarone therapy. The chest radiograph shows bilateral infiltrates and a ""ground-glass"" appearance, consistent with interstitial lung disease.

Spirometry in interstitial lung disease typically shows a restrictive pattern, characterized by decreased forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), with a normal or near-normal FEV1/FVC ratio. This is because the primary abnormality is in lung volume, rather than airflow. Therefore, option D is the most likely finding on spirometry.",Success
"A 2,300 g (5 lb) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this infant?",A,"The correct answer is A. Administer zidovudine.

The infant is at risk of vertical transmission of HIV from the mother, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that all infants born to HIV-infected mothers receive antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent transmission. Zidovudine is the recommended medication for this purpose. The infant should receive zidovudine as soon as possible after birth, and it should be continued for 6 weeks.

HIV antibody testing (Option B) is not useful in this scenario because the infant will have maternal antibodies, which can persist for up to 18 months. HIV DNA or RNA testing (Options C and D) may be used to diagnose HIV infection in the infant, but they are not the next step in management.

She says that the shortness of breath is worse on exertion and improves with rest. While she could previously walk to the nearby store for her groceries, she now has to drive because she gets ''winded'' on the way. The patient was diagnosed with diabetes 5 years ago and is compliant with her medications. The medical history is otherwise unremarkable. The physical examination reveals gross ascites and visibly engorged periumbilical veins. Bilateral pitting edema is noted around the ankles. The finger-prick blood glucose level is 100 mg/dL. What is the mechanism of action of the anti-diabetic medication this patient is most likely taking?",D,"The correct answer is D. Increased gene expression of GLUT-4.

The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath and abdominal distension, suggest the presence of heart failure, which is a common comorbidity with diabetes. The physical examination findings of gross ascites, engorged periumbilical veins, and bilateral pitting edema are also consistent with heart failure.

Given the patient's history of diabetes and the presence of heart failure, it is likely that the patient is taking a medication that improves insulin sensitivity, such as a thiazolidinedione (TZD). TZDs work by increasing the expression of GLUT-4, a glucose transporter, in adipose tissue and muscle, which enhances glucose uptake and improves insulin sensitivity.",Success

She is sexually active with two male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandin.

The patient's symptoms, including pelvic pain radiating to her back and thighs, occurring a few hours before her menstrual period and lasting for 2 days, are consistent with dysmenorrhea, which is caused by endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandin. This is a common condition in menstruating women, especially in those who are sexually active. The patient's use of ibuprofen, which has provided some relief, also supports this diagnosis, as ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can help reduce prostaglandin production and alleviate dysmenorrhea symptoms.",Success

Autopsy of brain tissue suggests a viral infection. The likely causal virus spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) in the following manner:",C,"The correct answer is C. Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons.

The patient's symptoms and history suggest rabies, which is a viral infection that affects the central nervous system (CNS). Rabies virus spreads to the CNS through retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons, typically after an animal bite or other exposure to the virus.

A 19-year-old Caucasian male presents to your office with hypopigmented skin. He undergoes a skin biopsy and is found to have an absence of melanocytes in the epidermis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,C,"The correct answer is C. Vitiligo.

Vitiligo is a condition characterized by the destruction of melanocytes, resulting in patches of hypopigmented skin. The absence of melanocytes in the epidermis, as found in the skin biopsy, is a hallmark of vitiligo.

Tinea versicolor (A) is a fungal infection that causes hypopigmented patches, but it does not involve the destruction of melanocytes.

Albinism (B) is a genetic disorder characterized by a complete lack of melanin production, resulting in a complete absence of pigmentation. While albinism can cause hypopigmentation, it is not typically associated with an absence of melanocytes in the epidermis.

Solar lentigo (D) is a benign lesion caused by sun exposure, resulting in hyperpigmentation, not hypopigmentation.

On physical examination, there is palpable, firm, non-tender cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy bilaterally. He also has moderate splenomegaly, which, when palpated, elicits pain. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient’s most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Fludarabine.

The patient's initial diagnosis is likely chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), based on the peripheral blood smear and differential showing 92% small normocytic lymphocytes. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings at the 3-year follow-up visit, including swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, and splenomegaly, suggest that the disease has progressed.

Fludarabine is a chemotherapy medication that is commonly used to treat CLL, particularly in patients who have progressed to a more advanced stage. It is often used in combination with other medications, such as rituximab, to achieve a better response.

The patient's laboratory results show a metabolic acidosis (low pH and low bicarbonate levels) with a normal anion gap, suggesting a non-anion gap acidosis. The urine pH is 7.0, which is inappropriately high in the setting of metabolic acidosis, indicating that the kidneys are not able to acidify the urine properly. This is consistent with a type 1 (distal) renal tubular acidosis (RTA).

Amphotericin B is a medication that can cause type 1 RTA by damaging the distal tubules and impairing their ability to acidify the urine. The other options do not typically cause this type of acid-base disorder.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (A) can cause a type 3 RTA, but it is less likely to cause a type 1 RTA.

Acetazolamide (B) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that can cause a metabolic acidosis, but it would not typically cause a type 1 RTA.

The patient's laboratory results show a low free T3 level (0.1 ng/dL) and a low-normal free T4 level (0.9 ng/dL), indicating hypothyroidism. The normal TSH level (1.8 µU/mL) suggests that the hypothyroidism is not due to primary thyroid failure, but rather due to a non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), also known as sick euthyroid syndrome. This is a common condition seen in critically ill patients, where the thyroid hormone levels are decreased due to the illness itself, rather than a primary thyroid problem.

In this case, the patient's hypotension and septic shock are likely contributing to the NTIS. Treatment with levothyroxine (B) is indicated to support the patient's thyroid function and potentially improve her hemodynamic status.

The other options are not correct:

Examination shows a tender, swollen left knee joint; range of motion is limited by pain. Analysis of the synovial fluid confirms septic arthritis, and the prosthesis is removed. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?",A,"The correct answer is A. Staphylococcus epidermidis.

Staphylococcus epidermidis is a common cause of prosthetic joint infections, particularly in the early post-operative period (within 3-6 months). It is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus that is commonly found on the skin and can contaminate the surgical site during implantation of the prosthesis. It is known to form biofilms, which can make it difficult to treat infections.

While Staphylococcus aureus (option C) can also cause prosthetic joint infections, it is more commonly associated with acute infections, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a subacute presentation.

Escherichia coli (option B) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (option D) are more commonly associated with urinary tract infections and pneumonia, respectively, and are less likely to cause prosthetic joint infections.

Abdominal ultrasonography is shown. Stool is negative for Entamoeba histolytica antigen. Which of the following is the best initial step in management of this patient condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Antibiotics and drainage.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a diagnosis of liver abscess, which is supported by the abdominal ultrasonography findings. The patient's history of diabetes mellitus and the presence of a tender liver edge that is palpable below the right costal margin are consistent with this diagnosis.

The best initial step in management is to administer antibiotics and perform drainage of the abscess. This is because liver abscesses are typically polymicrobial, and antibiotics can help to control the infection. Drainage of the abscess is also necessary to remove the infected material and promote healing.

Metronidazole and paromomycin (Option A) are not the best initial step, as they are typically used to treat amebic liver abscesses, which is not the likely diagnosis in this case given the negative stool test for Entamoeba histolytica antigen.

Antifungal therapy (Option B) is not indicated, as there is no evidence to suggest a fungal infection.

Cholecystectomy (Option C) is not necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a liver abscess than with gallbladder disease.

A lymph node biopsy shows granuloma formation and large CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's laboratory findings?",D,"The correct answer is E. Production of PTH-related peptide by malignant cells.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with lymphoma, specifically Hodgkin lymphoma, given the presence of CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei. The elevated serum calcium concentration and normal PTH level suggest that the hypercalcemia is not due to primary hyperparathyroidism. The most likely explanation is that the malignant cells are producing parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), which is a hormone that can cause hypercalcemia by stimulating bone resorption and increasing calcium reabsorption in the kidneys.",Success
"A 32-year-old man comes to the physician for a pre-employment examination. He recently traveled to Guatemala. He feels well but has not seen a physician in several years, and his immunization records are unavailable. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:
Anti-HAV IgM Positive
Anti-HAV IgG Negative
HBsAg Negative
Anti-HBs Positive
HBcAg Negative
Anti-HBc Negative
HBeAg Negative
Anti-HBe Negative
Anti-HCV Negative
Which of the following best explains this patient's laboratory findings?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Active hepatitis A infection.

Here's why:

* Anti-HAV IgM is positive, which indicates a recent or active hepatitis A infection. IgM antibodies are typically produced early in the course of an infection.
* Anti-HAV IgG is negative, which suggests that the patient has not had a previous hepatitis A infection.
* The other laboratory results are negative for hepatitis B and C, which rules out active or chronic infections with those viruses.

Therefore, the patient's laboratory findings are consistent with an active hepatitis A infection, which is likely related to his recent travel to Guatemala.",Success
"A 7-month-old male infant is brought to the pediatrician by his mother. She reports that the child develops severe sunburns every time the infant is exposed to sunlight. She has applied copious amounts of sunscreen to the infant but this has not helped the problem. On examination, there are multiple areas of reddened skin primarily in sun exposed areas. The child’s corneas appear irritated and erythematous. Which of the following processes is likely impaired in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Nucleotide excision repair.

The symptoms described in the question, such as severe sunburns, reddened skin, and irritated corneas, are consistent with a diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a rare genetic disorder. XP is characterized by a defect in nucleotide excision repair, a process that repairs DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light. This defect leads to an inability to repair DNA damage, resulting in the severe sun sensitivity and skin problems described in the question.",Success
"A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a neck mass. He first noticed a firm mass on the anterior aspect of his neck approximately 4 months ago. The mass is painless and has not increased in size since then. He has also noticed occasional fatigue and has gained 10 pounds in the past 4 months despite no change in his diet or exercise frequency. His past medical history is notable for gout for which he takes allopurinol. He denies any prior thyroid disorder. He runs 4 times per week and eats a balanced diet of mostly fruits and vegetables. He does not smoke and drinks a glass of wine with dinner. His family history is notable for medullary thyroid cancer in his maternal uncle. His temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 127/72 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 19/min. On exam, he has a firm, symmetric, and stone-firm thyroid. A biopsy of this patient's lesion would most likely demonstrate which of the following findings?",B,"The correct answer is E. Stromal amyloid deposition.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). The presence of a firm, symmetric, and stone-hard thyroid gland, along with a family history of MTC, suggests this diagnosis. MTC is a type of thyroid cancer that arises from the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland and is often associated with amyloid deposition in the stroma. A biopsy of the lesion would likely demonstrate stromal amyloid deposition, which is a characteristic feature of MTC.",Success
"A group of researchers decided to explore whether the estimates of incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were influenced by the number of years it took to examine administrative data. These estimates were not only based on hospital discharges, but also on physician billing codes. For study purposes, the researchers labeled incident cases at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases were those that were coded as harboring SLE at any time, with patients maintaining their diagnosis until death. Which statement is true regarding the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study?",B,"The correct answer is C. The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.

Here's why:

* Incidence rates measure the number of new cases of a disease (in this case, SLE) that occur within a specific time period. Prevalence rates, on the other hand, measure the total number of existing cases of a disease within a specific time period.
* When examining shorter time periods, the prevalence of SLE will be overestimated because it will include cases that may have been diagnosed in previous time periods, but are still active. This means that the prevalence rate will be artificially inflated.
* As the time period increases, the prevalence rate will become more accurate, as it will capture a more complete picture of all existing cases of SLE.

The other options are not correct:

* A. Examining successively longer time periods will result in higher prevalence estimates, not lower ones.
* B. Incidence rates are not necessarily higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.
* D. Attack rates are not relevant to this study, and their inclusion would not increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.
* E. Attack rates are not relevant to this study, and their inclusion would not decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.",Success
"A 48-year-old Caucasian female presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of progressive weakness and shortness of breath. She has had progressive shortness of breath over the last year with an intermittent non-productive cough. In addition, she complains of difficulty raising her arms to brush her hair. Her temperature is 99.6°F (37.6°C), pulse is 80/min, blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Neurologic exam shows 4/5 strength in the deltoid muscles bilaterally. Diffuse dry crackles are heard on lung auscultation. A faint erythematous rash is noted on the malar cheeks, periorbital areas, lateral proximal thighs, and the elbows. Which of the following tests is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is D. Serum ANA titer.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of dermatomyositis, an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the skin and muscles. The presence of a rash on the malar cheeks, periorbital areas, lateral proximal thighs, and elbows, along with muscle weakness and shortness of breath, suggests this diagnosis.

A serum ANA (antinuclear antibody) titer is a common test used to confirm the diagnosis of dermatomyositis. ANA is a type of autoantibody that is often present in the blood of patients with autoimmune diseases, including dermatomyositis. A positive ANA titer would support the diagnosis of dermatomyositis.

While muscle biopsy (A) may also be useful in diagnosing dermatomyositis, it is a more invasive procedure and may not be necessary if the ANA titer is positive. A CT scan (B) may be useful in evaluating the patient's lung disease, but it would not confirm the diagnosis of dermatomyositis. Pulmonary function tests (C) may be useful in assessing the patient's lung function, but they would not be diagnostic for dermatomyositis. A skin biopsy (E) may be useful in evaluating the patient's rash, but it would not be as specific for dermatomyositis as a positive ANA titer.",Success

"A 41-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with abdominal pain. He says that the pain “comes and goes” throughout the day and usually lasts 20-30 minutes per episode. He can point to the spot 1-2 inches above the umbilicus where he feels the pain. He denies any feeling of regurgitation or nighttime cough but endorses nausea. He reports that he used to eat three large meals per day but has found that eating more frequently improves his pain. He tried a couple pills of ibuprofen with food over the past couple days and thinks it helped. He has gained four pounds since his past appointment three months ago. The patient denies any diarrhea or change in his stools. He has no past medical history. He drinks 5-6 beers on the weekend and has a 20 pack-year smoking history. He denies any family history of cancer. On physical exam, he is tender to palpation above the umbilicus. Bowel sounds are present. A stool guaiac test is positive. The patient undergoes endoscopy with biopsy to diagnose his condition.

Which of the following is most likely to be found on histology?",B,"The correct answer is A. Mucosal defect in the stomach.

The patient's symptoms, such as abdominal pain that improves with eating, nausea, and tenderness to palpation above the umbilicus, are consistent with peptic ulcer disease. The positive stool guaiac test suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, which is also consistent with a peptic ulcer. The endoscopy with biopsy is likely to show a mucosal defect in the stomach, which is the characteristic histological finding in peptic ulcer disease.",Success
"A 5-year-old female presents to the pediatrician for a routine office visit. The patient is in kindergarten and doing well in school. She is learning to read and is able to write her first name. Her teacher has no concerns. The patient’s mother is concerned that the patient is a picky eater and often returns home from school with most of her packed lunch uneaten. The patient’s past medical history is significant for moderate persistent asthma, which has required three separate week-long courses of prednisone over the last year and recently diagnosed myopia. The patient’s mother is 5’7”, and the patient’s father is 5’10”. The patient’s weight and height are in the 55th and 5th percentile, respectively, which is consistent with her growth curve. On physical exam, the patient has a low hairline and a broad chest. Her lungs are clear with a mild expiratory wheeze. The patient’s abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. She has Tanner stage I breast development and pubic hair.

This patient is most likely to have which of the following additional findings?",A,"The correct answer is C. Elevated serum TSH level.

The patient's physical exam findings, such as a low hairline and a broad chest, are consistent with Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females and is characterized by short stature, ovarian dysgenesis, and a range of physical features. One of the common endocrine abnormalities associated with Turner syndrome is hypothyroidism, which would result in an elevated serum TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's presentation:

A. Absent Barr bodies on buccal smear would suggest Klinefelter syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects males.

B. Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level could be related to various conditions, such as bone disorders or liver disease, but is not specifically related to the patient's presentation.

The decision is made to stop the statin and return to the clinic in 2 weeks to assess any changes in symptoms. After stopping the statin, his muscular symptoms resolve. What is the next best course of action to take regarding his LDL control?",A,"The correct answer is C. Initiate a different statin.

The patient experienced muscle pain and weakness, which are common side effects of statins, particularly at high doses. Since the symptoms resolved after stopping the rosuvastatin, it is likely that the statin was the cause of the symptoms. Instead of restarting the same statin at a lower dose, it would be better to try a different statin, as the patient may tolerate it better. This approach allows the patient to continue receiving the benefits of statin therapy for LDL control while minimizing the risk of muscle-related side effects.",Success
An unidentified surgical specimen is received for histopathologic analysis. A portion of the specimen is cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The remainder is analyzed and is found to contains type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate. Which of the following structures is most likely the origin of this surgical specimen?,E,"The correct answer is E. Larynx.

The presence of type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate in the surgical specimen suggests that it is derived from cartilage. The larynx (voice box) is a structure that contains cartilage, making it the most likely origin of the specimen.

Blood cultures grow acid-fast organisms. A PPD skin test shows 4 mm of induration. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Azithromycin and ethambutol.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. The growth of acid-fast organisms in blood cultures and the patient's low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count support this diagnosis.

Azithromycin and ethambutol are the recommended treatment for disseminated MAC infection in patients with AIDS. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is effective against MAC, and ethambutol is an antimycobacterial agent that is often used in combination with azithromycin to treat MAC infection.

"A 49-year-old woman comes to the physician for a scheduled colposcopy. Two weeks ago, she had a routine Pap smear that showed atypical squamous cells. Colposcopy shows an area of white discoloration of the cervix with application of acetic acid solution. Biopsy of this area shows carcinoma-in-situ. Activation of which of the following best explains the pathogenesis of this condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. E2F transcription factors.

Carcinoma-in-situ, a precursor to cervical cancer, is often caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV proteins E6 and E7 interact with and inactivate the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and Rb, respectively. This leads to the activation of E2F transcription factors, which promote cell proliferation and contribute to the development of cervical cancer.

"A research group has developed a low-cost diagnostic retinal imaging device for cytomegalovirus retinitis in a population of HIV-infected patients. In a pilot study of 50 patients, the imaging test detected the presence of CMV retinitis in 50% of the patients. An ophthalmologist slit lamp examination, which was performed for each patient to serve as the gold standard for diagnosis, confirmed a diagnosis of CMV retinitis in 20 patients that were found to be positive through imaging, as well as 1 patient who tested negative with the device. If the prevalence of CMV retinitis in the population decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, how will positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the diagnostic test be affected?",B,"The correct answer is B. PPV decreases, NPV increases.

When the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases, the number of true positives (patients with the disease who test positive) will decrease, while the number of false positives (patients without the disease who test positive) will remain relatively constant. This will decrease the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the proportion of patients with a positive test result who actually have the disease.

On the other hand, the number of true negatives (patients without the disease who test negative) will increase, while the number of false negatives (patients with the disease who test negative) will remain relatively constant. This will increase the negative predictive value (NPV), which is the proportion of patients with a negative test result who do not have the disease.

She vaguely explains that the necklace is to mask her scent from the moles tracking her. She has no past psychiatric history and she denies hearing voices or seeing objects. No significant past medical history. Although she has lived in the same community for years, she says she usually keeps to herself and does not have many friends. She holds a regular job at the local hardware store and lives alone. Which of the following is the best initial course of treatment for this patient?",A,"The correct answer is D. A brief trial of antipsychotic therapy.

The patient's behavior and beliefs, such as setting up bear traps to protect herself from ""mole people"" and wearing a garlic necklace to mask her scent, suggest a delusional disorder. Delusional disorders are characterized by the presence of non-bizarre delusions that are not better explained by another mental disorder, such as schizophrenia. In this case, the patient's delusions are not accompanied by hallucinations or other symptoms that would suggest a different diagnosis.

A brief trial of antipsychotic therapy is a reasonable initial course of treatment for this patient. Antipsychotic medications, such as risperidone or olanzapine, can help to reduce the severity of delusions and improve the patient's functioning.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may also be helpful in addressing the patient's delusions and improving her coping skills, but it is not the best initial course of treatment. The patient does not require electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) at this point, and referring her to outpatient group therapy may not be sufficient to address her delusional beliefs.

His past medical history is noncontributory. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. The primary care provider recommends keeping a sleep journal and provides a questionnaire for the patient’s wife. The patient returns one month later to report no changes to his condition. The sleep journal reveals that the patient is getting sufficient sleep and wakes up rested. The questionnaire reveals that the patient does not snore nor does he stop breathing during his sleep. A sleep study reveals mean sleep latency of 6 minutes. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Methylphenidate.

The patient's symptoms, including excessive daytime sleepiness and falling asleep during meetings, suggest a diagnosis of narcolepsy. The sleep study result of a mean sleep latency of 6 minutes supports this diagnosis, as it indicates that the patient falls asleep quickly during the day.

Methylphenidate is a stimulant medication that is commonly used to treat narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness. It helps to increase alertness and wakefulness during the day.

Option B, sodium oxybate, is also used to treat narcolepsy, but it is typically reserved for cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness) and excessive daytime sleepiness that is not adequately controlled with other medications.

Option C, imipramine, is an antidepressant that is not typically used to treat narcolepsy.

Physical examination shows a 10-cm, soft, cystic, nontender right scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?",D,"The correct answer is D. Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a hydrocele, which is a fluid-filled sac surrounding the testicle. The fact that the mass is soft, cystic, and transilluminates suggests that it is filled with fluid. The ability to palpate normal tissue above the mass and the lack of bowel sounds or reduction in size when the patient is in a supine position rule out an inguinal hernia. The normal examination of the testis makes testicular cancer or torsion unlikely.

A hydrocele is caused by an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis, a layer of tissue that surrounds the testicle. This can occur due to various reasons, including inflammation, trauma, or tumor. In this case, the patient's family history of seminoma may be a contributing factor, but it is not the direct cause of the hydrocele.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination:

A. Patent processus vaginalis would suggest an inguinal hernia, which is not consistent with the physical examination findings.

B. Dilation of the pampiniform plexus would suggest a varicocele, which is a dilation of the veins in the scrotum, but this is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination.

C. Twisting of the spermatic cord would suggest testicular torsion, which is a surgical emergency that would present with severe pain and a high-riding testicle, neither of which is present in this patient.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Actinic keratosis.

The image shows a small, rough, scaly patch on the scalp, which is consistent with actinic keratosis. Actinic keratoses are small, rough, scaly patches that develop on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, ears, and scalp. They are caused by long-term exposure to the sun and are more common in older adults, especially those who have fair skin and live in sunny areas.

"A routine newborn screening test for phenylketonuria in a male neonate shows a serum phenylalanine concentration of 44 mg/dL (N < 20). He is started on a special diet and the hyperphenylalaninemia resolves. At a routine well-child examination 4 months later, the physician notices that he has persistent head lag. On examination, he has blue eyes, pale skin, blonde hair, and generalized hypotonia. His serum prolactin level is markedly elevated. Supplementation of which of the following substances is most likely to prevent further complications of this patient's condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Tetrahydrobiopterin.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a deficiency of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor necessary for the production of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. The elevated serum prolactin level is a clue to this diagnosis, as BH4 is also necessary for the regulation of prolactin secretion.

The patient's initial hyperphenylalaninemia was likely due to a defect in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is also dependent on BH4 as a cofactor. The resolution of the hyperphenylalaninemia with dietary restriction of phenylalanine suggests that the patient has a defect in BH4 synthesis or recycling, rather than a defect in the phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme itself.

Supplementation with BH4 is likely to prevent further complications of this patient's condition, such as developmental delay, seizures, and movement disorders.",Success
"A 36-year-old nursing home worker presents to the clinic with the complaints of breathlessness, cough, and night sweats for the past 2 months. She further expresses her concerns about the possibility of contracting tuberculosis as one of the patients under her care is being treated for tuberculosis. A PPD skin test is done and reads 11 mm on day 3. Chest X-ray demonstrates a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe. The standard anti-tuberculosis medication regimen is started. At a follow-up appointment 3 months later the patient presents with fatigue. She has also been experiencing occasional dizziness, weakness, and numbness in her feet. Physical exam is positive for conjunctival pallor. Lab work is significant for a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume of 68 fl. What is the most likely cause of her current symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is A. Decreased methionine synthesis.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, weakness, and numbness in her feet, along with conjunctival pallor and a low hemoglobin level (10 g/dL) and mean corpuscular volume (68 fl), suggest anemia. The most likely cause of this anemia is a deficiency of vitamin B12, which is a common side effect of isoniazid (INH) therapy, one of the medications used to treat tuberculosis.

Isoniazid inhibits the enzyme methionine synthase, which is necessary for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. This leads to a deficiency of vitamin B12, which is required for the production of red blood cells. The resulting anemia is characterized by small, pale red blood cells (microcytic anemia).

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and the side effects of isoniazid therapy:

B. Inhibition of ferrochelatase is related to lead poisoning, not isoniazid therapy.

C. Increased homocysteine degradation is not a known side effect of isoniazid therapy.

D. Increased GABA production is related to the mechanism of action of isoniazid as an antidepressant, but it is not related to the patient's symptoms.

E. Decreased ALA synthesis is related to the metabolism of heme, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and the side effects of isoniazid therapy.",Success
"A 23-year-old woman is referred to a genetic counselor. She is feeling well but is concerned because her brother was recently diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis. All first-degree relatives were encouraged to undergo genetic screening for any mutations associated with the disease. Today, she denies fever, chills, joint pain, or skin hyperpigmentation. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 123/78 mm Hg. Her physical examination is normal. Her serum iron, hemoglobin, ferritin, and AST and ALT concentrations are normal. Gene screening will involve a blood specimen. Which of the following genes would suggest hereditary hemochromatosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. HFE gene.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder characterized by excessive iron absorption and accumulation in the body. The HFE gene is responsible for regulating iron absorption, and mutations in this gene are the most common cause of hereditary hemochromatosis. The HFE gene is located on chromosome 6 and encodes a protein that helps regulate iron absorption in the small intestine.

The other options are not correct because:

A. BCR-ABL gene is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia.

B. BRCA gene is associated with breast and ovarian cancer.

C. FA gene is associated with Fanconi anemia, a rare genetic disorder.

E. WAS gene is associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system.",Success
"A 16-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with constant abdominal pain over the past 8 hours. The pain is in her right lower quadrant (RLQ), which is also where it began. She has had no nausea or vomiting despite eating a snack 2 hours ago. She had a similar episode last month which resolved on its own. Her menstrual cycles are 28–30 days apart with 3–5 days of vaginal bleeding. Her last menses ended 9 days ago. Her blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 78/min, the respirations are 15/min, and the temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F). Abdominal examination shows moderate pain on direct pressure over the RLQ which decreases with the release of pressure. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 12.5 mg/dL
Leukocyte count 6000/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 55%
Lymphocytes 39%
Platelet count 260,000/mm3
Serum  
C-reactive protein 5 mg/L (N < 8 mg/L)
Urine  
RBC 1-2 phf
WBC None
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Reassurance.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with mittelschmerz, a benign condition characterized by mid-cycle abdominal pain due to ovulation. The pain is typically mild to moderate, localized to the lower abdomen, and resolves on its own. The patient's normal laboratory studies, including a normal white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, support this diagnosis.

Reassurance and observation are the most appropriate next steps in management, as mittelschmerz is a self-limiting condition that does not require specific treatment. The other options are not indicated in this scenario:

A. Methotrexate is a medication used to treat ectopic pregnancy, which is not suspected in this case.

B. Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections, which is not supported by the patient's urine analysis.

D. Referral for surgery is not necessary, as the patient's symptoms are not suggestive of a surgical emergency.

"A 30-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a complaint of abdominal pain. The patient states he was at a barbecue around noon. Lunch was arranged as a buffet without refrigeration. Within 2 to 3 hours, he had abdominal pain with 3 episodes of watery diarrhea. On exam, vital signs are T 99.1, HR 103, BP 110/55, RR 14. Abdominal exam is significant for pain to deep palpation without any rebounding or guarding. There is no blood on fecal occult testing (FOBT). What is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?",C,"The correct answer is C. Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain and watery diarrhea, are consistent with a foodborne illness. The fact that the symptoms occurred within 2-3 hours of eating at a buffet without refrigeration suggests a toxin-mediated illness, which is characteristic of Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning. S. aureus produces a heat-stable toxin that can cause symptoms within 1-6 hours of ingestion. The lack of blood on fecal occult testing (FOBT) also supports this diagnosis, as S. aureus typically does not cause bloody diarrhea.",Success
"A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by staff of the group home where he resides because of worsening confusion for the past week. He has a history of major depressive disorder and had an ischemic stroke 4 months ago. Current medications are aspirin and sertraline. He is lethargic and disoriented. His pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 135/88 mm Hg. Physical examination shows moist oral mucosa, normal skin turgor, and no peripheral edema. While in the waiting room, he has a generalized, tonic-clonic seizure. Laboratory studies show a serum sodium of 119 mEq/L and an elevated serum antidiuretic hormone concentration. Which of the following sets of additional laboratory findings is most likely in this patient?
 $$$ Serum osmolality %%% Urine sodium %%% Serum aldosterone $$$",E,"The correct answer is D. ↓ ↑ ↑.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. SIADH is a condition in which the body produces too much antidiuretic hormone (ADH), leading to excessive water retention and dilutional hyponatremia.

In SIADH, the following laboratory findings are typically seen:

* Serum sodium: decreased (↓)
* Serum osmolality: decreased (↓)
* Urine sodium: increased (↑), as the kidneys are unable to dilute the urine properly
* Serum aldosterone: increased (↑), as the body tries to compensate for the excessive water retention

"A 35-year-old woman presents with severe fear reactions to seeing dogs after moving into a new suburban neighborhood. She states that she has always had an irrational and excessive fear of dogs but has been able to avoid it for most of her life while living in the city. When she sees her neighbors walking their dogs outside, she is terrified and begins to feel short of breath. Recently, she has stopped picking up her children from the bus stop and no longer plays outside with her children in order to avoid seeing any dogs. Which of the following would be the best definitive treatment for this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Systematic desensitization.

The patient is experiencing a specific phobia, in this case, cynophobia (fear of dogs). Systematic desensitization is a type of behavioral therapy that is specifically designed to treat phobias. It involves gradually exposing the patient to the feared object (in this case, dogs) in a controlled and safe environment, while teaching them relaxation techniques to manage their anxiety response. This approach helps the patient to gradually become comfortable with the presence of dogs and eventually overcome their phobia.

While SSRIs (A) and benzodiazepines (B) may be used to treat anxiety disorders, they are not the most effective treatment for specific phobias like cynophobia. Cognitive behavioral therapy (D) is a broader type of therapy that can be effective for anxiety disorders, but it may not specifically target the phobia in the same way that systematic desensitization does. Dialectical behavioral therapy (E) is a type of therapy that is typically used to treat borderline personality disorder, and is not typically used to treat specific phobias.",Success
"A 45-year-old man arrives by ambulance to the emergency room after being involved in a very severe construction accident. The patient was found unconscious with a large metal spike protruding from his abdomen by a coworker who was unable to estimate the amount of time the patient went without medical aid. Upon arrival to the ER, the patient was unconscious and unresponsive. His vital signs are BP: 80/40, HR: 120 bpm, RR: 25 bpm, Temperature: 97.1 degrees, and SPO2: 99%.He is taken to the operating room to remove the foreign body and control the bleeding. Although both objectives were accomplished, the patient had an acute drop in his blood pressure during the surgery at which time ST elevations were noted in multiple leads. This resolved with adequate fluid resuscitation and numerous blood transfusions. The patient remained sedated after surgery and continued to have relatively stable vital signs until his third day in the intensive care unit, when he experiences an oxygen desaturation of 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute. On auscultation air entry is present bilaterally with the presence of crackles. A 2/6 systolic murmur is heard. Readings from a Swan-Ganz catheter display the following: central venous pressure (CVP): 4 mmHg, right ventricular pressure (RVP) 20/5 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP): 20/5 mmHg. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP): 5 mm Hg. A chest x-ray is shown as Image A. The patient dies soon after this episode. What is the most likely direct cause of his death?",A,"The correct answer is A. Diffuse alveolar damage.

The patient's symptoms and test results suggest acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by diffuse alveolar damage. The patient experienced oxygen desaturation despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen, and auscultation revealed crackles bilaterally, indicating lung injury. The chest x-ray (Image A) likely shows bilateral infiltrates or opacities, consistent with ARDS. The Swan-Ganz catheter readings show a low CVP and PCWP, indicating hypovolemia, and elevated RVP and PAP, indicating pulmonary hypertension, which is consistent with ARDS.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and test results:

B. Ventricular septal defect is a congenital heart defect that would not cause the patient's acute respiratory distress.

C. Myocardial free wall rupture is a complication of myocardial infarction, but the patient's ECG showed ST elevations that resolved with fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions, and there is no evidence of cardiac tamponade.

D. Papillary muscle rupture is a complication of myocardial infarction, but there is no evidence of mitral regurgitation or cardiac failure.

E. Myocardial reinfarction is possible, but the patient's symptoms and test results suggest a pulmonary rather than cardiac cause of death.",Success

Chest radiograph shows increased bronchovascular markings, reticular parenchymal opacities, and multiple pleural plaques. Labs are unremarkable except for a slight anemia. Which of the following is the most likely finding on this patient's chest CT?",E,"The correct answer is B. Honeycombing.

The patient's symptoms, medical history, and chest radiograph findings are consistent with asbestosis, a lung disease caused by asbestos exposure. The presence of pleural plaques on the chest radiograph is a strong indicator of asbestos exposure. Asbestosis is characterized by interstitial fibrosis, which would appear as honeycombing on a chest CT.",Success
"A 60-year-old man presents with a 2-day history of increasing difficulty in breathing with a productive cough. He reports having shortness of breath over the last 6 months, but he has felt worse since he contracted a cold that has been traveling around his office. Today, he reports body aches, headache, and fever along with this chronic cough. His past medical history is significant for prediabetes, which he controls with exercise and diet. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history. His blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse rate is 90/min, temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), and respiratory rate is 18/min. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilateral, a barrel-shaped chest, and measured breathing through pursed lips. A chest X-ray reveals a flattened diaphragm and no signs of consolidation. Pulmonary function testing reveals FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%. Arterial blood gases (ABG) of this patient are most likely to reveal which of the following?",B,"The correct answer is B. Primary respiratory acidosis.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The chest X-ray and pulmonary function testing (PFT) results support this diagnosis. The FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% indicates airflow obstruction, which is a hallmark of COPD.

Given the patient's respiratory symptoms and PFT results, it is likely that the arterial blood gases (ABG) will reveal a primary respiratory acidosis. This means that the patient's pH will be low (acidotic) due to an increase in PaCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide). This is because the patient's lungs are not able to effectively expel CO2, leading to a buildup of this gas in the blood.

The other options are not correct:

A. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis would be characterized by a low pH and a normal anion gap, which is not consistent with the patient's respiratory symptoms and PFT results.

C. Primary respiratory alkalosis would be characterized by a high pH and a low PaCO2, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and PFT results.

D. Compensatory respiratory acidosis would imply that the patient's body is compensating for a metabolic alkalosis by increasing ventilation and blowing off CO2, which is not the case here.

E. Anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis is not a likely combination given the patient's symptoms and PFT results.",Success
A 34-year-old male suffers from inherited hemophilia A. He and his wife have three unaffected daughters. What is the probability that the second daughter is a carrier of the disease?,E,"The correct answer is C. 66.67% (not among the options, but closest to C. 50%).

Since the father has hemophilia A, he is hemizygous for the mutated gene (Xh). The mother is normal, so she is homozygous for the normal gene (XX). All three daughters are unaffected, which means they inherited the normal X chromosome from their mother.

The probability that each daughter is a carrier (Xh) is 2/3 or approximately 66.67%, since they have a 2/3 chance of inheriting the mutated X chromosome from their father and a 1/3 chance of inheriting the normal X chromosome from their mother.

So, the probability that the second daughter is a carrier of the disease is approximately 66.67%, which is closest to option C. 50%.",Success
"A 76-year-old man is brought to his physician's office by his wife due to progressively worsening hearing loss. The patient reports that he noticed a decrease in his hearing approximately 10 years ago. His wife says that he watches television at an elevated volume and appears to have trouble understanding what is being said to him, especially when there is background noise. He states that he also experiences constant ear ringing and episodes of unsteadiness. On physical examination, the outer ears are normal and otoscopic findings are unremarkable. The patient is unable to repeat the sentence said to him on whisper testing. When a vibrating tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, it is heard equally on both ears. When the vibrating tuning fork is placed by the ear and then on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Which of the following structures is most likely impaired in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Cochlea.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest sensorineural hearing loss, which is a type of hearing loss that occurs due to damage to the inner ear or the auditory nerve. The cochlea is the structure responsible for converting sound vibrations into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain, and damage to the cochlea can cause sensorineural hearing loss.

The patient's symptoms, such as progressive hearing loss, difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments, and constant ear ringing (tinnitus), are all consistent with cochlear damage. The physical examination findings, including the inability to repeat a sentence on whisper testing and the results of the tuning fork test, also support a diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss.

The other options are not likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms. The tympanic membrane (A) and the ossicles (B and C) are involved in conductive hearing loss, which is a different type of hearing loss that occurs due to problems with the middle ear. The stapes (D) is one of the ossicles, and damage to the stapes would also cause conductive hearing loss.",Success

If a lumbar puncture is performed in this patient, which of the following would most likely be found in cerebrospinal fluid analysis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Oligoclonal IgG bands on electrophoresis.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The MRI study likely shows lesions in the brain and spinal cord, which is also consistent with MS.

In MS, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis often shows oligoclonal IgG bands on electrophoresis, which indicates the presence of antibodies produced within the central nervous system. This is a characteristic finding in MS and helps to support the diagnosis.

The other options are not consistent with MS:

A. 14-3-3 protein is a marker for prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

The patient's concern is about the 1+ glucose result on a home dipstick test, which suggests possible glucosuria (glucose in the urine). To determine the cause of this result, a urinalysis is indicated to assess for other signs of urinary tract infection, kidney damage, or other conditions that may be contributing to the glucosuria. The patient's fasting glucose level is within normal limits, and there is no indication for an oral glucose tolerance test or HbA1c measurement at this time.

No murmurs are noted. An exercise stress test is performed to further evaluate the patient’s pain. Which of the following substances is released locally to increase coronary blood flow during exertion?",A,"The correct answer is A. Adenosine.

During exertion, the heart requires more oxygen to meet the increased demand. To increase coronary blood flow, adenosine is released locally as a vasodilator. Adenosine binds to A2A receptors on coronary artery smooth muscle cells, causing relaxation and dilation of the vessels, which increases blood flow to the heart. This helps to match oxygen delivery to the increased oxygen demand of the heart during exercise.

Physical exam reveals bilateral wheezes and poor air movement. His oxygen saturation is 80%. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. BiPAP.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with an exacerbation of COPD, and the patient is not responding to initial treatment with bronchodilators and oxygen. The next step in management would be to provide non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) with BiPAP, which can help improve lung expansion, reduce work of breathing, and increase oxygenation. BiPAP is often used in patients with COPD exacerbations who are not responding to initial treatment and can help avoid the need for intubation.

A chest radiograph (option B) may be useful in evaluating for other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as pneumonia, but it is not the best next step in management.

Chest tube placement (option C) is not indicated in this scenario, as there is no evidence of a pneumothorax.

Intubation (option D) may be necessary if the patient's respiratory status continues to deteriorate, but it is not the best next step in management at this point.

Needle decompression (option E) is used to treat a tension pneumothorax, which is not suspected in this scenario.",Success
"A 76-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of low back pain and weakness for the past 4 weeks. He says that the pain is sharp, radiates to his left side, and has a burning quality. He has had a cough occasionally productive of blood-streaked sputum for the past 2 months. He has had 3.2-kg (7.0-lb) weight loss in that time. He is now unable to walk without assistance and has had constipation and difficulty urinating for the past 2 weeks. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 60 years. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. He is oriented to person, place, and time. Neurologic examination shows 3/5 strength of the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are hyperreflexive. Babinski sign is present bilaterally. Sensory examination shows decreased sensation to pinprick below the T4 dermatome. He is unable to lie recumbent due to severe pain. An x-ray of the chest shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest spinal cord compression, likely due to metastatic cancer. The presence of multiple round opacities in both lungs on chest x-ray suggests lung cancer, which is a common cause of spinal cord compression. The patient's severe back pain, weakness, and difficulty walking are consistent with spinal cord compression.

Intravenous dexamethasone therapy is the most appropriate next step in management to reduce spinal cord edema and relieve symptoms. Radiation therapy (Option A) may be necessary later, but it is not the immediate next step. Intravenous acyclovir therapy (Option C) is not indicated, as there is no evidence of herpes infection. Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy (Option D) may be necessary if there is concern for pneumonia, but it is not the primary concern in this case. Oral ibuprofen therapy (Option E) would not be sufficient to manage the patient's severe symptoms.",Success
"A 32-year-old man arrives to his primary care physician to discuss his fear of flying. The patient reports that he has had a fear of flying since being a teenager. He went on a family vacation 15 years ago, and during the flight there was turbulence and a “rough landing”. Since then he has avoided flying. He did not go to his cousin’s wedding because it was out of the country. He also was unable to visit his grandmother for her 80th birthday. The last time his job asked him to meet a client out of state, he drove 18 hours instead of flying. Two years ago he promised his fiancé they could fly to Florida. Upon arrival at the airport, he began to feel dizzy, lightheaded, and refused to go through security. During the clinic visit, the patient appears anxious and distressed. He recognizes that his fear is irrational. He is upset that it is affecting his relationship with his wife. Additionally, his current job may soon require employees in his sales position to fly to meet potential clients. He is embarrassed to have a conversation with his manager about his fear of flying. Which of the following is the best therapy for the patient’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Cognitive behavioral therapy.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with a specific phobia, specifically aviophobia (fear of flying). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a highly effective treatment for specific phobias, including aviophobia. CBT helps the patient identify and challenge negative thoughts and behaviors associated with the phobia, and learn coping skills to manage anxiety in the presence of the feared stimulus (in this case, flying).

Alprazolam (A) is a benzodiazepine that may provide short-term relief from anxiety, but it is not a long-term solution and can be habit-forming. Fluoxetine (C) is an antidepressant that may be used to treat anxiety disorders, but it is not specifically indicated for phobias. Psychodynamic psychotherapy (D) may help the patient understand the underlying causes of their phobia, but it is not as effective as CBT in reducing symptoms. Zolpidem (E) is a sedative-hypnotic that is not indicated for the treatment of phobias or anxiety disorders.",Success
"A 75-year-old man presents to a medical clinic for evaluation of a large, tense, pruritic bulla on his inner thighs, abdomen, and lower abdomen. A skin biopsy is performed, which shows an epidermal basement membrane with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and linear immunofluorescence. Which of the following is the most likely cell junction to which the antibodies bind?",D,"The correct answer is D. Hemidesmosomes.

The patient's symptoms and the skin biopsy results are consistent with bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune skin disease characterized by the formation of bullae (blisters) on the skin. The linear immunofluorescence pattern on the skin biopsy suggests that the antibodies are binding to the epidermal basement membrane zone.

In bullous pemphigoid, the autoantibodies bind to the hemidesmosomes, which are specialized cell junctions that anchor the epidermis to the dermis. Specifically, the antibodies target the BP180 and BP230 proteins, which are components of the hemidesmosomes. This binding leads to the separation of the epidermis from the dermis, resulting in the formation of bullae.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Adherens junctions are involved in cell-cell adhesion, but they are not typically involved in bullous pemphigoid.

B. Desmosomes are also involved in cell-cell adhesion, but they are not the primary target of autoantibodies in bullous pemphigoid.

C. Gap junctions are involved in cell-cell communication, but they are not related to the pathogenesis of bullous pemphigoid.

E. Tight junctions are involved in the formation of a barrier between cells, but they are not typically involved in bullous pemphigoid.",Success
"A 16-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her father because of concerns about her behavior during the past 2 years. She does not have friends and spends most of the time reading by herself. Her father says that she comes up with excuses to avoid family dinners and other social events. She states that she likes reading and feels more comfortable on her own. On mental status examination, her thought process is organized and logical. Her affect is flat. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Schizoid personality disorder.

The patient's symptoms, such as preferring to be alone, avoiding social interactions, and having a flat affect, are consistent with schizoid personality disorder. People with schizoid personality disorder often have difficulty forming and maintaining relationships, and may prefer to spend time alone, engaging in solitary activities such as reading. They may also have a restricted range of emotions, which can manifest as a flat affect.

Schizotypal personality disorder (option B) is also a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's organized and logical thought process. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by disorganized thinking, odd beliefs, and eccentric behavior, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.

Antisocial personality disorder (option C) is not a good fit, as it is characterized by a disregard for others' rights and a lack of empathy, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.

Schizophreniform disorder (option D) is a psychotic disorder that is characterized by a brief episode of psychosis, which is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.

Autism spectrum disorder (option E) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behaviors. While the patient's avoidance of social interactions and preference for solitary activities may be similar to those seen in autism spectrum disorder, the patient's organized and logical thought process and lack of repetitive behaviors make this diagnosis less likely.",Success
"Twelve hours after admission to the hospital because of a high-grade fever for 3 days, a 15-year-old boy has shortness of breath. During this period, he has had generalized malaise and a cough productive of moderate amounts of green sputum. For the past 10 days, he has had fever, a sore throat, and generalized aches; these symptoms initially improved, but worsened again over the past 5 days. His temperature is 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse is 109/min, respirations are 27/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. There are decreased breath sounds and crackles heard over the upper right lung field. His hemoglobin concentration is 13.3 g/dL, leukocyte count is 15,000/mm3, and platelet count is 289,000/mm3. An x-ray of the chest shows a right upper-lobe infiltrate. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is B. Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

The patient's symptoms, such as a high-grade fever, cough, and shortness of breath, are consistent with pneumonia. The fact that the patient's symptoms initially improved but then worsened again over the past 5 days suggests a possible atypical pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of atypical pneumonia in adolescents and young adults, and it is known to cause a prolonged illness with a biphasic course, which fits with the patient's history.

The chest x-ray showing a right upper-lobe infiltrate also supports this diagnosis. While Streptococcus pneumoniae (option A) can cause pneumonia, it is more likely to cause a lobar pneumonia with a more sudden onset, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with an atypical pneumonia. Staphylococcus aureus (option C) is a possible cause of pneumonia, but it is less likely in this case given the patient's age and the lack of other symptoms suggestive of a staphylococcal infection. Chlamydophila pneumoniae (option D) is another possible cause of atypical pneumonia, but it is less common than Mycoplasma pneumoniae in this age group. Haemophilus influenzae (option E) is a possible cause of pneumonia, but it is more likely to cause a lobar pneumonia with a more sudden onset, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with an atypical pneumonia.",Success
"An elderly man presents to his physician with complaints of difficulty breathing, easy fatigability, and bilateral leg swelling which began 2 months ago. His breathlessness worsens while walking, climbing the stairs, and lying flat on his back. He also finds it difficult to sleep well at night, as he often wakes up to catch his breath. His pulse is 98/min and blood pressure is 114/90 mm Hg. On examination, he has mild respiratory distress, distended neck veins, and bilateral pitting edema is evident on the lower third of his legs. His respiratory rate is 33/min, SpO2 is 93% in room air, and coarse crepitations are heard over the lung bases. On auscultation, the P2 component of his second heart sound is heard loudest at the second left intercostal space, and an S3 gallop rhythm is heard at the apex. Medication is prescribed for his symptoms which changes his cardiac physiology as depicted with the dashed line recorded post-medication. What is the mechanism of action of the prescribed medication?",B,"The correct answer is E. Reduction in myocardial contractility.

The graph shows a decrease in the left ventricular pressure and an increase in the left ventricular volume, indicating a decrease in myocardial contractility. This is consistent with the mechanism of action of medications such as beta blockers, which reduce the contractility of the heart and decrease the workload on the heart. This can help to alleviate symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath and fatigue, by reducing the heart's oxygen demand and improving cardiac output.",Success
"A 30-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of excessive fatigue and weakness for the last several weeks. He also complains of abdominal pain and constipation for the same duration. On further questioning, he reports that he has lost 8 pounds in the last 2 weeks. Past medical history and family history are insignificant. His temperature is 37.3° C (99.2° F), respirations are 21/min, pulse is 63/min, and blood pressure is 99/70 mm Hg. On physical examination, he is a tired-appearing, thin male. He has a bronze discoloration to his skin, but he denies being outside in the sun or any history of laying in tanning beds. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?",D,"The correct answer is E. Order an ACTH stimulation test.

The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, and weight loss, are consistent with adrenal insufficiency. The bronze discoloration of the skin, also known as hyperpigmentation, is a classic sign of Addison's disease, a type of primary adrenal insufficiency. The next step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis with an ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) stimulation test, which measures the response of the adrenal glands to ACTH. This test will help determine if the patient has primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) or secondary adrenal insufficiency (due to pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction).

The other options are not correct because:

A. Administering intravenous hydrocortisone without a confirmed diagnosis may mask the underlying condition and make it more difficult to diagnose.

B. Fludrocortisone is a mineralocorticoid that is used to treat adrenal insufficiency, but it should not be administered without a confirmed diagnosis.

C. Androgen replacement therapy is not indicated in this scenario.

D. Starting both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy without a confirmed diagnosis is premature and may lead to unnecessary treatment.",Success
A 27-year-old HIV positive female gave birth to a 7lb 2oz (3.2 kg) baby girl. The obstetrician is worried that the child may have been infected due to the mother's haphazard use of her anti-retroviral medications. Which of the following assays would a hospital use detect the genetic material of HIV if the child had been infected?,D,"The correct answer is D. Polymerase chain reaction.

The reason is that the child may have acquired maternal antibodies to HIV, which would make serologic tests (such as ELISA, Western blot, and rapid HIV antibody test) unreliable for diagnosing HIV infection in the child. These tests would detect the maternal antibodies, not the child's own infection.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a molecular diagnostic test that can detect the genetic material of HIV (viral RNA or DNA) in the child's blood. This test can diagnose HIV infection in the child as early as a few days after birth, and is the preferred method for diagnosing HIV infection in infants.

Southern blot is a laboratory technique used to detect specific DNA sequences, but it is not typically used for diagnosing HIV infection in infants.",Success
"A 53-year-old man presents to his physician’s office with a persistent cough which he has had over the last few months. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the previous year and since then has been on a short-acting β-agonist to help alleviate his symptoms. Since his diagnosis, he has quit smoking, a habit which he had developed about 30 years ago. He used to smoke about 2 packs of cigarettes daily. Today, he has come in with an increase in his symptoms. He tells his physician that he has been having a fever for the past 3 days, ranging between 37.8°–39°C (100°F–102.2°F). Along with this, he has a persistent cough with copious amounts of greenish-yellow sputum. He has also been having difficulty breathing. On examination, his temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), the respirations are 22/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 115/min. Slight crackles and respiratory wheezes are prominent in the lower lung fields. His FEV1 is 57% of his normal predicted value. He is started on oxygen and a dose of oral prednisone. At this time, which of the following should also be considered as a treatment option?",A,"The correct answer is B. Ciprofloxacin.

The patient's symptoms, including a fever, cough with greenish-yellow sputum, and difficulty breathing, suggest an exacerbation of COPD, likely due to a bacterial infection. The patient's history of COPD, smoking, and recent increase in symptoms support this diagnosis.

Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is commonly used to treat bacterial exacerbations of COPD. It has good coverage against common pathogens that cause COPD exacerbations, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Doxycycline (Option A) is a tetracycline antibiotic that may also be used to treat COPD exacerbations, but it is not as commonly used as ciprofloxacin.

Erythromycin (Option C) is a macrolide antibiotic that is not typically used to treat COPD exacerbations.

Piperacillin (Option D) is a penicillin antibiotic that is often used to treat more severe infections, such as pneumonia, but it may not be the best choice for this patient's symptoms.

Option E, ""Antibiotics would not be appropriate at this time,"" is incorrect because the patient's symptoms suggest a bacterial infection, and antibiotics are a common treatment for COPD exacerbations.",Success

One month ago, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of fever, irritability, and neck rigidity, and he was successfully treated with antibiotics. His temperature today is 37.5°C (98.5°F). An MRI of the brain shows bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space. Which of the following is the most likely explanation of the patient's condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations.

The patient's symptoms, such as morning headaches, nausea, and vomiting, are consistent with increased intracranial pressure. The MRI findings of bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space suggest hydrocephalus. Given the patient's recent history of meningitis, it is likely that the infection caused scarring and obstruction of the arachnoid granulations, which are responsible for reabsorbing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the bloodstream. This would lead to impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations, resulting in hydrocephalus.",Success

There is an ill-defined, nontender mass in the upper right abdomen. He undergoes surgical resection of the tumor. Histopathologic examination of this mass is most likely to show which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is D. Small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil.

The symptoms described, such as unsteady gait, frequent falls, and twitching of the extremities, are consistent with a neurological disorder. The presence of an abdominal mass and the histopathologic features described in the question are characteristic of a neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that arises from neural crest cells.

Statistical analysis reports a p-value of 0.052. Which of the following best describes the meaning of this p-value?",B,"The correct answer is B. There is a 5.2% chance that A is more effective than B is due to chance.

The p-value represents the probability of observing the difference between the two groups (or a more extreme difference) assuming that there is no real difference between the two statins (i.e., the null hypothesis is true). In this case, the p-value is 0.052, which means that there is a 5.2% chance of observing the 11 mg/dL difference (or a more extreme difference) between the two groups due to chance, rather than a real effect of statin A being more effective than statin B.",Success
"A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department because she has a cord-like rash on her left calf that is red and painful to touch. She says that she has had multiple such lesions previously. Other medical history reveals that she has had 3 past spontaneous abortions at < 10 weeks of gestational age but has never been diagnosed with any diseases. She drinks socially but has never smoked or used drugs. She has never taken any medications except for over the counter analgesics and antipyretics. Physical exam shows that the cord-like lesion is tender, thick, and hardened on palpation. In addition, she has a lacy mottled violaceous rash on multiple extremities. Which of the following antibodies would most likely be found in this patient's blood?",A,"The correct answer is A. Anti-cardiolipin.

The patient's symptoms, including the cord-like rash on her calf (consistent with livedo reticularis) and the lacy mottled violaceous rash on her extremities, are suggestive of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The patient's history of multiple spontaneous abortions also supports this diagnosis. Anti-cardiolipin antibodies are a type of antiphospholipid antibody that are commonly found in the blood of patients with APS.

Anti-centromere antibodies (option B) are typically found in patients with limited systemic sclerosis (CREST syndrome), which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Anti-helicase antibodies (option C) are not a recognized type of autoantibody associated with a specific disease or syndrome.

On physical examination, the patient has severe edema over her face and an audible stridor in both lungs. Of the following options, which is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. IM epinephrine.

The patient is presenting with symptoms of anaphylaxis, a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction, likely due to the peanut allergy. The symptoms include respiratory distress, facial edema, and a skin rash. The patient has a history of asthma and severe peanut allergy, and she forgot to bring her EpiPen.

The most appropriate next step in management is to administer intramuscular (IM) epinephrine, which is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis.

"An investigator is studying the cell morphologies of the respiratory tract. He obtains a biopsy from the mainstem bronchus of a patient. On microscopic examination, the biopsy sample shows uniform squamous cells in layers. Which of the following best describes the histologic finding seen in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Metaplasia.

The description of the biopsy sample showing uniform squamous cells in layers suggests that the normal columnar or ciliated epithelium of the mainstem bronchus has been replaced by squamous epithelium, which is not typical of this location. This is an example of metaplasia, a process in which one type of differentiated cell is replaced by another type of differentiated cell, often in response to chronic irritation or injury.

A CT scan of the head shows an unchanged right-sided subdural hematoma. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",D,"The correct answer is D. Fluid restriction.

The patient's laboratory results indicate hyponatremia (Na+ 130 mEq/L), which is likely due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. This is supported by the low serum sodium, high urine osmolality, and high urine sodium levels. SIADH is a common complication of head trauma, and it can lead to hyponatremia.

The most appropriate next step in management is fluid restriction (option D) to help correct the hyponatremia. Fluid restriction will help reduce the amount of free water in the body, which will help increase the serum sodium levels.

A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital for treatment of unstable angina. Cardiac catheterization shows occlusion that has caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery. Resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased by what factor relative to a vessel with no occlusion?,B,"The correct answer is B. 16.

The resistance to blood flow in a vessel is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the vessel (Poiseuille's law). Since the diameter of the vessel has been reduced by 50%, the radius has been reduced by 50% as well.

Let's call the original radius ""r"". The new radius is 0.5r.

The original resistance is proportional to 1/r^4. The new resistance is proportional to 1/(0.5r)^4 = 1/(0.0625r^4) = 16/r^4.

The inferior gluteal nerve, which is responsible for extending the hip, is not affected, as the child is able to stand on the right leg.

The superior gluteal nerve is located in the inferolateral quadrant of the buttock. Therefore, the most likely location of the vaccine injection that caused the symptoms is the inferolateral quadrant of the right buttock.",Success
"A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of decreased appetite and abdominal pain for the last several weeks. Physical examination shows a well-appearing toddler with a palpable left-sided abdominal mass that does not cross the midline. A CT of the abdomen shows a large, necrotic tumor on the left kidney. Histological examination of the kidney mass shows primitive blastemal cells and immature tubules and glomeruli. This tissue is most likely derived from the same embryological structure as which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is B. Adrenal medulla.

The tumor described in the question is a Wilms' tumor, which is a type of kidney cancer that occurs in children. Wilms' tumors are derived from the metanephric blastema, which is the embryological structure that gives rise to the kidneys and adrenal glands. The adrenal medulla, which is the inner part of the adrenal gland, develops from the same embryological structure as the kidneys.",Success
"A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an increasing difficulty in hearing over the past several months. His mother says they have to speak at a higher volume for him to understand them. He also complains of having difficulty reading his favorite books because he is not able to see the words clearly. His father received a renal transplant in his 20s. The vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Serum
Urea nitrogen 15 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL
Urine
Blood 1+
Protein 1+
RBC 15–17/hpf
WBC 1–2/hpf
The audiometry shows bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. The ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus. Which of the following best explains these findings?",A,"The correct answer is A. Alport syndrome.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Alport syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, ears, and eyes. The key findings that support this diagnosis are:

* Bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which is a characteristic feature of Alport syndrome
* Anterior lenticonus, a conical deformation of the lens of the eye, which is also a hallmark of the disease
* Hematuria (blood in the urine) and proteinuria (excess protein in the urine), which indicate kidney damage
* Family history of kidney disease, as the patient's father received a renal transplant in his 20s

Alport syndrome is caused by mutations in the COL4A3, COL4A4, or COL4A5 genes, which code for type IV collagen, a protein essential for the structure and function of basement membranes in the kidneys, ears, and eyes. The disease typically affects males, and females can be carriers of the mutated gene.",Success
"A 16-year-old female presents to her primary care physician due to lack of menstruation. She has never had a period and is anxious that she is not “keeping up” with her friends. She states that her breasts began developing when she was 13, and she had a growth spurt around the same time. Review of systems reveals that she has also been getting headaches every few months over the last year with some photosensitivity and nausea each time. Ibuprofen relieves her symptoms. The patient is a competitive ice skater and has never been sexually active. Her mother has a history of migraine headaches, and her older sister has a history of bipolar disorder. Both underwent menarche at age 15. At this visit, the patient’s temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 118/65 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Her body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Both breasts are Tanner IV with no expressable discharge. Pelvic and axillary hair growth is also Tanner IV. The patient is unable to tolerate a full pelvic exam, but the part of the vaginal canal that is examined is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are ordered and are below:

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
K+: 4.1 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL

Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH): 16.2 mIU/mL (4.7-21.5 mIU/ml)
Estrogen: 240 pg/mL (64-357 pg/mL)

Abdominal ultrasound is performed and shows a normal uterus and ovaries. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is E. Normal development.

The patient's physical examination and laboratory results are consistent with normal pubertal development. She has Tanner IV breast and pubic hair development, indicating that she is in the late stages of puberty. Her estrogen levels are within the normal range, and her FSH levels are slightly elevated but still within the normal range. The abdominal ultrasound shows a normal uterus and ovaries.

The patient's symptoms of headaches, photosensitivity, and nausea are likely related to migraines, which are common in adolescents and have a family history in this case.

There is no evidence to suggest hypothalamic amenorrhea (A), which would be characterized by low FSH and estrogen levels. Hyperprolactinemia (B) would cause galactorrhea (spontaneous milk production) and low estrogen levels, which are not present in this patient. Imperforate hymen (C) and vaginal septum (D) would cause primary amenorrhea with a normal uterus and ovaries, but the patient's pelvic exam and ultrasound do not suggest any anatomical abnormalities.",Success
"A 35-year-old man presents to the emergency room due to shortness of breath that started an hour ago while playing football with some friends. He has had similar episodes in the past when he also had to be rushed to the hospital. Physical examination shows body temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse rate is 100/min, respiratory rate is 28/min and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Also, it shows decreased breath sounds on both sides, the peak expiratory flow rate is 200 L/min and SpO2 is 89% on room air. The man is given an initial treatment with nebulization using an inhaled short-acting β-agonist. An arterial blood gas analysis shows the following:
pH 7.48
PaO2 59 mm Hg
PaCO2 26 mm Hg
HCO3- 26 mEq/L
After administering oxygen by mask, the man’s PaO2 increases to 75 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Asthma attack.

The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath, decreased breath sounds, and low peak expiratory flow rate, are consistent with an asthma attack. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a normal pH, low PaCO2, and low PaO2, which is also consistent with asthma. The patient's response to oxygen therapy, with an increase in PaO2, further supports this diagnosis.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

B. Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning would not cause decreased breath sounds or a low peak expiratory flow rate.

C. Atelectasis would typically cause a more localized decrease in breath sounds, rather than bilateral decreased breath sounds.

D. Neuromuscular disease would not typically cause a low peak expiratory flow rate or respond to oxygen therapy.

E. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) would typically cause a more severe hypoxemia and would not respond as well to oxygen therapy.",Success
"A 48-year-old homeless male is brought to the emergency department, by the police, for altered mental status. Past medical records are unavailable. A physical exam on admission reveals scleral icterus and a flapping tremor of the wrists during extension. The patient is admitted to the hospital and his treatment is started after appropriate investigation. The next morning on rounds, he complains of eleven episodes of diarrhea and near-constant flatulence overnight. His mental status has improved and his hand tremor has resolved. Which of the following medications did this patient most likely receive after admission?",B,"The correct answer is B. Lactulose.

The patient's symptoms of altered mental status, scleral icterus, and flapping tremor of the wrists are consistent with hepatic encephalopathy. The treatment for hepatic encephalopathy often includes lactulose, which is a non-absorbable disaccharide that helps to reduce the production of ammonia in the gut and promote its excretion. The side effects of lactulose include diarrhea and flatulence, which the patient is experiencing. The improvement in the patient's mental status and resolution of the hand tremor also support the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy and the use of lactulose as a treatment.",Success
"A 61-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of abdominal pain and constipation. He reports a 4-day history of steady right lower quadrant pain. He has had one small bowel movement in 4 days. Normally he has a bowel movement once a day. His medical history is notable for poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, and atorvastatin. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history and drinks 3-4 beers per day. His diet consists primarily of fast food. His temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 16/min. A review of the patient’s medical record reveals colonoscopy results from 1 year ago. Relevant findings included multiple small, pedunculated polyps which were removed, multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings, and no other masses. This patient’s condition is most strongly associated with which of the following disorders?",C,"The correct answer is C. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and constipation, along with the presence of multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings (diverticula) found on colonoscopy, suggest a diagnosis of diverticulitis. The presence of multiple small, pedunculated polyps is also consistent with this diagnosis.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by defects in collagen synthesis, leading to tissue fragility and hyperextensibility. It is associated with an increased risk of developing diverticulosis and diverticulitis, as well as other gastrointestinal complications.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and condition:

A. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that can cause liver and lung disease.

B. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disorder is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys and liver.

"A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with sudden onset of slurred speech. The patient’s eldest daughter says that he couldn’t move his arm during the episode. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and a hemorrhagic stroke 6 years ago, which was treated surgically. After admission, the patient gets increasingly worse and loses consciousness. A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain. The patient’s daughter is asked to consent to a non-emergent, life-saving operation since the patient is in a comatose state. She does not consent to the operation even though the physician stresses it would be life-saving. Upon further discussion, the physician finds out that the patient was abusive and neglectful to his children, and the daughter wants “to live in peace.” The patient has no written advanced directive. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?",C,"The correct answer is A. Follow the daughter's wishes to withhold the operation.

In this scenario, the patient is in a comatose state and has no written advanced directive. The daughter, as the next of kin, has the authority to make medical decisions on behalf of the patient. Although the physician believes the operation is life-saving, the daughter has the right to refuse consent based on her own reasons, even if they may seem unconventional or motivated by personal feelings.

The other options are not appropriate:

B. Referring the case to the court would be unnecessary and may delay the decision-making process.

C. Contacting another family member for consent may not be feasible or appropriate, especially if the daughter is the primary caregiver or has a close relationship with the patient.

D. Performing the surgery without consent would be unethical and violate the patient's autonomy.

E. Reporting the daughter to the police is not relevant to the medical decision-making process and would not be an appropriate response.",Success
A 50-year-old man with congestive heart failure (CHF) was started on an experimental analog of atrial natriuretic peptide. Which of the following would he expect to experience?,C,"The correct answer is C. Increased glomerular filtration rate, restricted aldosterone release, vascular smooth muscle dilation.

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a hormone produced by the heart that helps to regulate blood pressure and fluid balance. It has several effects on the body, including:

* Increasing glomerular filtration rate, which helps to remove excess fluid from the body
* Restricting aldosterone release, which reduces sodium reabsorption in the kidneys and promotes sodium excretion
* Causing vascular smooth muscle dilation, which decreases blood pressure

Therefore, a patient taking an experimental analog of ANP would expect to experience increased glomerular filtration rate, restricted aldosterone release, and vascular smooth muscle dilation.",Success

Preparations are made for an emergency needle thoracostomy to be performed to treat this patient’s likely tension pneumothorax. Which one of the following is the best choice to provide informed consent for this procedure?",D,"The correct answer is D. Informed consent is not needed in this case.

In this scenario, the patient is unconscious and has a life-threatening condition (tension pneumothorax) that requires immediate treatment. Informed consent is not necessary in emergency situations where the patient is unable to provide consent and delaying treatment could result in harm or death. The healthcare team can proceed with the emergency needle thoracostomy without obtaining informed consent from the patient or their relatives.",Success
A group of researchers wants to evaluate how often the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is related to high-risk behaviors in female sex workers from their country. An additional aim is to evaluate the association between HIV acquisition and certain sociodemographic factors. The researchers collect data through interviewer-administered questionnaires (for behavioral and sociodemographic data) as well as through clinical and serological evaluation/screening methods for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Which of the following could be the main outcome measure of their study?,B,"The correct answer is B. Prevalence.

The study is evaluating the relationship between HIV and high-risk behaviors, as well as sociodemographic factors, in a group of female sex workers. The researchers are collecting data through questionnaires and clinical/serological evaluations, which suggests that they are measuring the proportion of female sex workers who have HIV at a particular point in time. This is a measure of prevalence, which is the number of cases of a disease or condition present in a population at a specific point in time.

Incidence (A) would refer to the number of new cases of HIV occurring in a population over a specific period of time, which is not the focus of this study. Hazard rate (C) is a measure of the rate at which events occur over time, and is not directly applicable to this study. Relative risk (D) and attributable risk (E) are measures of association between a risk factor and an outcome, but they are not the main outcome measure of this study.",Success
A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of multiple episodes of small amounts of blood in his stools. Examination shows pale conjunctivae. His hemoglobin concentration is 8.3 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume is 72μm3. Colonoscopy shows a 2.3-cm polypoid mass in the ascending colon. A photomicrograph of a biopsy specimen of the lesion is shown. Which of the following processes is most likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?,D,"The correct answer is D. Impaired degradation of β-catenin.

The photomicrograph shows a colonic adenoma, which is a precursor lesion to colon cancer. The pathogenesis of colonic adenomas and carcinomas is often associated with impaired degradation of β-catenin, a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway. This leads to the accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus, where it activates transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation.

The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of colonic adenomas or carcinomas:

A. Underexpression of COX-2 is not a known mechanism in the development of colonic neoplasms.

B. Increased activity of c-KIT is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).

C. Increased phosphorylation of serine and threonine is a general mechanism involved in many cellular processes, but it is not specific to the development of colonic neoplasms.

E. Abnormal transfer of phosphate to cellular proteins is not a known mechanism in the development of colonic neoplasms.",Success
"A 68-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with a 7-month history of fatigue and low back pain. Her pain is not improved by over the counter analgesics. Laboratory analysis is notable for a calcium level of 11.5 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen level of 30 mg/dL. Large eosinophilic casts are seen on renal biopsy. Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen on peripheral blood smear?",B,"The correct answer is D. Leukocytosis with abundant mature myeloid cells.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest multiple myeloma, a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow and can cause anemia, bone pain, and kidney damage. The presence of large eosinophilic casts on renal biopsy is also consistent with multiple myeloma.

On peripheral blood smear, multiple myeloma is often associated with leukocytosis (an elevated white blood cell count) with an abundance of mature myeloid cells, such as neutrophils and monocytes. This is because the cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow can stimulate the production of these cells.

The other options are not directly related to multiple myeloma:

A. Abundant reticulocytes would be seen in response to anemia, but it is not a specific finding in multiple myeloma.

B. Linear aggregations of red blood cells are seen in rouleaux formation, which can be a nonspecific finding in various conditions.

C. Schistocytes are fragmented red blood cells that are seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which is not typically associated with multiple myeloma.

"A 95-year-old woman who is a resident at a long term care facility, got up from her chair, tripped on a rug, and fell on her right knee. She could not get up without assistance and complained of severe pain in her right hip and buttock. The nurse who evaluated her tried to stand her up, but when the patient tried to stand on her right leg, she dropped her left hip and lost her balance. The nurse then recognized that her patient had a foreshortened right leg fixed in the adducted position and a large swelling in her right buttock. At the receiving hospital, the patient was confused and, though she knew her name, she couldn’t remember the date and insists to leave the hospital immediately to see her family. Past medical history includes diabetes, congestive heart failure, and incontinence. She is currently taking metformin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and oxybutynin. Physical exam confirmed the nurse’s findings. Radiographs proved the presence of a right posterior hip dislocation without fractures. What medication is most likely associated with this patient’s confusion?",B,"The correct answer is B. Oxybutynin.

Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic medication, which can cause confusion, especially in elderly patients. The patient's symptoms of confusion, disorientation, and agitation are consistent with anticholinergic toxicity. The other options are not typically associated with confusion as a side effect.",Success
"A 26-year-old woman comes to the clinic for an annual wellness examination. She is healthy with no prior history of significant illness.

When asked if anything is bothering her, she reports that she has been having recurring episodes of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes for the past year. She denies any fever, sick contacts, cough, headaches, chest pain, urinary symptoms, or constipation/diarrhea during these episodes. She is told to take a medication to alleviate her symptoms as needed. What is the likely mechanism of action of the medication in question?",A,"The correct answer is C. Disruption of disulfide bonds.

The patient's symptoms of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes suggest an allergic reaction, likely allergic rhinitis. The medication prescribed to alleviate her symptoms is likely an antihistamine, which works by disrupting the disulfide bonds of histamine, a chemical released during an allergic response. This prevents histamine from binding to its receptors, thereby reducing the allergic symptoms.",Success
"A 27-year-old woman was referred to a dermatology clinic due to a changing discoloration of her fingers from white to red to blue. Although she has not had any recent changes in her daily routines, she also complains of increasing fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight loss. She has a blood pressure of 126/77 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 14/min, and heart rate of 88/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. Anti-U1 RNP antibodies and increased creatinine kinase were found in her serum. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Mixed connective tissue disease.

The patient's symptoms, including the changing discoloration of her fingers (Raynaud's phenomenon), fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight loss, are consistent with a connective tissue disorder. The presence of anti-U1 RNP antibodies in her serum is a key diagnostic feature of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). MCTD is a rare autoimmune disorder that combines features of lupus, scleroderma, and polymyositis.

While the patient's symptoms could also be consistent with other connective tissue disorders, the presence of anti-U1 RNP antibodies makes MCTD the most likely diagnosis. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is possible, but the presence of anti-U1 RNP antibodies is more specific to MCTD. Polymyositis is also possible, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a multisystem disorder like MCTD. Systemic sclerosis is less likely given the absence of skin thickening or other characteristic features of this disorder. Rheumatoid arthritis is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.",Success

At that time, she would repeatedly engage in binge eating and purging behavior, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Her physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should be avoided in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Bupropion.

The patient has a history of binge eating and purging behavior, which suggests a history of bulimia nervosa. Bupropion is contraindicated in patients with a history of eating disorders, particularly bulimia nervosa, as it can increase the risk of seizures in these individuals.

The other options are all selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or a tetracyclic antidepressant, which are commonly used to treat depression and are not contraindicated in patients with a history of eating disorders.",Success

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's improved vision?",B,"The correct answer is A. Decreased susceptibility to glare.

The patient's improved vision is likely due to a decrease in the progression of cataracts, which is a common complication of diabetes. The hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic medication, may have contributed to the improvement in vision by reducing the glucose levels in the lens, thereby decreasing the formation of sorbitol, a sugar that can contribute to cataract formation. As a result, the patient's vision has improved, and he no longer needs glasses while driving.",Success
A 21-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with right arm pain and limited range of motion. She does not recall trauma to the arm. She also complains of diarrhea and nausea. She is sexually active with one male partner and admits to having pain during intercourse. There is vague and diffuse tenderness to palpation in all four abdominal quadrants. No erythema or edema is noted on the right arm. The fecal occult test is negative. Past records show that this patient has been in the ER 7 times in the past year with similar symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,C,"The correct answer is C. Somatization disorder.

The patient's symptoms, including right arm pain, limited range of motion, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal tenderness, are vague and diffuse, and there is no clear underlying medical cause. The fact that she has presented to the ER 7 times in the past year with similar symptoms suggests a pattern of excessive and repeated seeking of medical care for unexplained symptoms. This is consistent with somatization disorder, which is a psychiatric condition characterized by the presence of multiple, recurring, and unexplained physical symptoms that are not intentionally produced or feigned.

Somatization disorder is distinct from somatoform pain disorder (option D), which is characterized by pain as the primary symptom. Conversion disorder (option E) involves the sudden onset of neurological symptoms, such as paralysis or blindness, in response to psychological stress. Illness anxiety disorder (option B) involves excessive worry about having or acquiring a serious illness, but the patient's symptoms are not necessarily unexplained. Ulcerative colitis (option A) is a gastrointestinal condition that would likely have more specific and objective findings on examination and diagnostic testing.",Success

The patient admits to spending $2,000 of his parent’s money, without asking, on a down payment for a motorcycle. The episode resolved after 5 days, at which point the patient felt guilty and upset. The patient’s medical history is notable for multiple month-long episodes in the past 2 years of feeling sad, sleeping more than usual, being uninterested in his hobbies, and feeling constantly tired and guilty. The patient has a history of severe meningoencephalitis at the age of 17 requiring four days in the intensive care unit. During that episode, he reported seeing monkeys in his hospital room. On exam, he is a well-appearing, cooperative male in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented with a normal affect. He states that he feels sad and guilty about what happens. He denies suicidal ideation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is C. Cyclothymic disorder.

Here's why:

* The patient has a history of mood fluctuations, with episodes of elevated mood (5-day episode of minimal sleep and unusual levels of energy) and depressive episodes (multiple month-long episodes of feeling sad, sleeping more than usual, being uninterested in his hobbies, and feeling constantly tired and guilty).
* The patient's symptoms do not meet the criteria for a full-blown manic episode (which would require a 7-day duration or hospitalization), but rather a hypomanic episode (which can last for at least 4 days).
* The patient's history of severe meningoencephalitis at the age of 17, which included psychotic symptoms (seeing monkeys in his hospital room), suggests that he may have a underlying vulnerability to mood instability.
* Cyclothymic disorder is a chronic mood disorder characterized by frequent episodes of hypomania and depression that do not meet the full criteria for a major depressive episode or a manic episode.

Bipolar I disorder (A) is unlikely because the patient's elevated mood episode was not severe enough to require hospitalization or last for at least 7 days. Bipolar II disorder (B) is also unlikely because the patient's depressive episodes are not severe enough to meet the criteria for a major depressive episode. Persistent depressive disorder (D) is not a good fit because the patient has a history of elevated mood episodes. Schizoaffective disorder (E) is unlikely because the patient's psychotic symptoms were likely a result of his meningoencephalitis rather than a primary psychotic disorder.",Success

In addition to complete bowel rest, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Abdominal x-ray.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a severe flare of ulcerative colitis, possibly with toxic megacolon. The most appropriate next step in management would be to obtain an abdominal x-ray to evaluate for signs of colonic dilation, which is a hallmark of toxic megacolon. This is a medical emergency that requires prompt recognition and treatment.

The other options are not appropriate at this time:

A. Double-contrast barium enema is a diagnostic test that is contraindicated in acute colitis due to the risk of perforation.

There are no other prominent findings on physical examination. His chest X-ray does not show anything significant. The ECG reveals sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the best course of management at this time?",A,"The correct answer is B. CT scan.

The patient's symptoms, such as sudden difficulty breathing, sharp chest pain on inspiration, and tachycardia, are consistent with a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is at high risk for PE due to his recent knee replacement surgery and prolonged bed rest. The physical examination finding of pain in the right calf on dorsiflexion (Homan's sign) also suggests deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to PE.

A CT scan with contrast is the best course of management at this time because it is the most sensitive and specific test for diagnosing PE. It can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further treatment.

Option A, subcutaneous fondaparinux, is an anticoagulant that may be used for prophylaxis or treatment of DVT and PE, but it is not a diagnostic test.

Option C, inferior vena cava filter, is a treatment option for patients with PE who cannot receive anticoagulation therapy, but it is not a diagnostic test.

Tone is increased in his upper and lower extremities bilaterally. This patient's condition is most strongly associated with which of the following histologic findings on brain autopsy?",D,"The correct answer is A. Accumulations of beta-pleated sheets.

The patient's symptoms, such as slow and forced movements, shuffling gait, and increased tone, are consistent with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The histologic finding most strongly associated with Parkinson's disease is the accumulation of beta-pleated sheets, which are a type of protein aggregate found in Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies are a hallmark of Parkinson's disease and are composed of alpha-synuclein protein that has misfolded into a beta-pleated sheet structure.",Success
"A 16-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a regular check-up. His mother says that he has not yet begun to walk. He is exclusively breastfed. He is at the 20th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 50th percentile for head circumference. Physical examination shows erosion of the enamel on the lingual surface of the incisors and carious molars. He has frontal bossing. His wrists are widened, his legs appear bowed, and there is beading of the ribs. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Impaired growth plate mineralization.

The patient's symptoms, including delayed walking, bowed legs, widened wrists, and beading of the ribs, are consistent with rickets, a condition caused by impaired growth plate mineralization. The erosion of the enamel on the lingual surface of the incisors and carious molars also suggest a vitamin D deficiency, which is a common cause of rickets. The patient's breastfed diet and lack of sun exposure may have contributed to the vitamin D deficiency.",Success

The patient is treated urgently with intravenous fluid, dopamine, and broad spectrum antibiotics. The patient’s blood pressure improves to 101/70 mm Hg. On ultrasound of the abdomen, the common bile duct is dilated. What is the best next step in the management of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. ERCP.

The patient presents with signs of sepsis, jaundice, and right upper quadrant tenderness, suggesting a diagnosis of ascending cholangitis. The ultrasound finding of a dilated common bile duct supports this diagnosis. ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) is the best next step in management as it allows for both diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. ERCP can help to relieve the biliary obstruction, remove any stones or debris, and drain the infected bile.

"A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 5-month history of intermittent flank pain. Over the past 2 years, she has had five urinary tract infections. Her blood pressure is 150/88 mm Hg. Physical examination shows bilateral, nontender upper abdominal masses. Serum studies show a urea nitrogen concentration of 29 mg/dL and a creatinine concentration of 1.4 mg/dL. Renal ultrasonography shows bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple parenchymal anechoic masses. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The presence of bilateral, nontender upper abdominal masses, a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, and hypertension are all common features of ADPKD. The renal ultrasonography findings of bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple parenchymal anechoic masses are also characteristic of ADPKD.

Medullary sponge kidney (Option A) is a rare congenital disorder that affects the kidneys, but it is not typically associated with bilateral, nontender upper abdominal masses or hypertension.

Simple renal cysts (Option B) are common and usually asymptomatic, but they are not typically associated with recurrent urinary tract infections or hypertension.

Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (Option D) is a rare genetic disorder that typically presents in infancy or early childhood, and it is not consistent with the patient's age and symptoms.

"A 22-year-old man from Nepal presents to the emergency department complaining of swelling and pain in his right testicle. The patient states that he just arrived in the United States to live with his wife, with whom he is monogamous. The patient denies painful urination or urethral discharge, but admits that 10 days ago he “felt like he had a fever” and the right side of his face was swollen and painful. Which of the following is characteristic of the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is B. Dilation of the pampiniform plexus.

The patient's symptoms, including swelling and pain in the right testicle, along with a history of fever and swelling on the right side of his face, suggest a diagnosis of mumps orchitis. Mumps is a viral infection that can cause inflammation of the testicles, leading to orchitis. The pampiniform plexus is a network of veins in the spermatic cord that can become dilated in cases of orchitis, leading to testicular swelling and pain.

The other options are not characteristic of mumps orchitis:

A. Mumps is not preventable by a live attenuated vaccine (although there is an MMR vaccine that protects against measles, mumps, and rubella).

C. Mumps does not typically present with a painless chancre (a characteristic of syphilis).

Vital signs are within normal limits. The cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. Epidural anesthesia is performed and the patient's symptoms improve. Ten minutes later, the patient has dizziness. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's hypotension?",B,"The correct answer is B. Sympathetic block.

The patient's symptoms of dizziness, bradycardia (pulse of 68/min), and hypotension (blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg) after receiving epidural anesthesia are consistent with a sympathetic block. This is a common side effect of epidural anesthesia, particularly in pregnant women. The sympathetic block causes vasodilation, which leads to a decrease in blood pressure. The patient's symptoms improved with intravenous fluid resuscitation, which supports this diagnosis.

The other options are not as likely:

A. Decreased cardiac contractility is not a common side effect of epidural anesthesia.

C. Hypovolemia is possible, but the patient's symptoms improved with fluid resuscitation, making sympathetic block a more likely cause.

D. Acute pulmonary hypertension is not a common complication of epidural anesthesia.

E. Aortocaval compression is a possible cause of hypotension in pregnant women, but it is more likely to occur in the supine position, and the patient's symptoms improved with fluid resuscitation, making sympathetic block a more likely cause.",Success
"A 57-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by ambulance for dysarthria and left-sided facial droop. She is accompanied by her son, who states that the patient had just returned home an hour ago from walking the dog when suddenly the patient stated she felt “strange.” When her son asked her what was wrong, her speech was slurred and her ""face looked funny.” The son quickly called an ambulance. The paramedic upon arrival noted that the patient had left-sided facial droop. Her medical history includes asthma and sickle cell disease. She takes hydroxyurea, uses oxycodone as needed for pain, and an albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath.

Peripheral blood smear shows multiple clumps of elongated and curved cells and erythrocytes with nuclear remnant. The patient's hemoglobin electrophoresis result is pictured below. What is the most likely cause of his condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Sickle cell disease.

The patient's symptoms, such as jaundice, normocytic anemia, and severe bone pain, are consistent with sickle cell disease. The peripheral blood smear showing multiple clumps of elongated and curved cells (sickle cells) and erythrocytes with nuclear remnants (Howell-Jolly bodies) also supports this diagnosis. The hemoglobin electrophoresis result, which shows a predominance of HbS, further confirms the diagnosis of sickle cell disease.

Sickle cell trait (A) is a carrier state that typically does not cause symptoms, and the hemoglobin electrophoresis result would show a mixture of HbA and HbS.

Hemoglobin F (C) is a normal fetal hemoglobin that is present in small amounts in adults, but it would not cause the symptoms and laboratory findings seen in this patient.

Hemoglobin SC (D) is a variant of sickle cell disease that is typically milder than sickle cell disease, and the hemoglobin electrophoresis result would show a mixture of HbS and HbC.

A 23-year-old man presents with sudden loss of consciousness while pitching in a baseball game. There is no history of injury. Consciousness is regained after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Past medical history is negative for any neurological and cardiovascular problems. Physical examination reveals a prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse and a double apical impulse. There are no audible murmurs. An S4 is present. What is the most likely diagnosis?,B,"The correct answer is B. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

The symptoms and physical examination findings in this patient are consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The sudden loss of consciousness while engaging in physical activity is a common presentation of HCM, and the physical examination findings of a prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse, a double apical impulse, and an S4 are all characteristic of HCM. The absence of audible murmurs does not rule out HCM, as the murmur may not always be present.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (A) would typically present with signs of heart failure, such as jugular venous distension, pedal edema, and a third heart sound, which are not mentioned in this scenario. Aortic stenosis (C) would typically present with a systolic murmur, which is not mentioned.

An MRI of the brain with contrast is shown in the exhibit (see image). A brain biopsy is performed that reveals perivascular clusters of lymphocytes. Which of the following is most associated with this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is B. Human herpes virus.

The patient's symptoms, including recurrent headaches, seizures, and obtundation, along with the MRI findings and brain biopsy results, are consistent with a diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the brain and is often associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. However, in this case, the correct answer is Human herpes virus (HHV), which is another name for Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). HHV-8 is a virus that is associated with PCNSL, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.

The other options are not directly associated with PCNSL:

A. Epstein-Barr virus is associated with various lymphoproliferative disorders, including Burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but it is not the most specific answer in this case.

However, she has been lost to follow-up and has not had proper follow up in years. Currently, she complains of dizziness and occasional dyspnea on exertion which has gradually increased during her pregnancy. Prior to her pregnancy, she did not have any symptoms. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, heart rate 81/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F). Her examination is significant for acrocyanosis and a fixed splitting of S2 and grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border. Which of the following physiological pregnancy changes is causing the change in this patient’s condition?",C,"The correct answer is D. Increase in cardiac output.

The patient's symptoms of dizziness and dyspnea on exertion, which have worsened during pregnancy, are likely due to the increased cardiac output that occurs during pregnancy. The increased cardiac output can exacerbate the patient's underlying cardiac condition, which is likely an atrial septal defect (ASD) given the fixed splitting of S2 and the midsystolic murmur heard over the left upper sternal border. The increased cardiac output can cause more blood to flow through the defect, leading to increased right-to-left shunting and worsening cyanosis and symptoms.",Success

The patient's symptoms, such as diarrhea, vomiting, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, piloerection, and dilated pupils, are consistent with opioid withdrawal. The presence of multiple scars in the antecubital fossa suggests a history of intravenous drug use. Clonidine is a medication that can be used to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms by reducing the sympathetic nervous system response and alleviating symptoms such as anxiety, hypertension, and tachycardia.",Success
"A 45-year-old woman presents to the clinic with her husband to discuss her most recent problem. She and her husband recently bought a new house in the area. While cleaning the house, they discovered a nest of spiders. She reports blacking out and waking up outside the house with a bandage on her arm. Her husband says that she began screaming and ran out of the house, breaking a window, and cutting her arm. The patient says she has tried to enter the house several times over the last several months but can not bring herself to cross the threshold for fear of more spiders. She wants to overcome her extreme and irrational fear. Which of the following is the most effective treatment to overcome this patient’s arachnophobia?",A,"The correct answer is A. Desensitization.

Desensitization is a type of exposure therapy that is commonly used to treat specific phobias, such as arachnophobia. The goal of desensitization is to help the patient gradually become comfortable with the feared object or situation (in this case, spiders) by gradually exposing them to it in a controlled and safe environment. This can be done through imaginal exposure (imagining the feared situation), in vivo exposure (actual exposure to the feared situation), or a combination of both.

While medications such as paroxetine (B) and alprazolam (D) may be used to treat anxiety disorders, they are not the most effective treatment for specific phobias like arachnophobia. Metoprolol (C) is a beta blocker that is sometimes used to treat performance anxiety, but it is not typically used to treat phobias. Psychotherapy (E) is a broad term that encompasses many different types of therapy, including desensitization, but it is not a specific treatment approach.

Desensitization has been shown to be a highly effective treatment for specific phobias, with success rates of 70-90% or higher in some studies. It is often preferred over medication because it can produce long-term changes in behavior and cognition, and it does not have the potential side effects associated with medication.",Success

Muscle strength is decreased in the left lower extremity. The Babinski sign is present on the left. A CT scan of the head is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",E,"The correct answer is C. Cerebral shunting.

The patient's symptoms and CT scan suggest normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a condition characterized by the gradual accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to cognitive decline, gait disturbances, and incontinence. The CT scan likely shows enlarged ventricles, which is a hallmark of NPH.

Cerebral shunting is a surgical procedure that involves diverting excess cerebrospinal fluid from the brain to another part of the body, such as the abdomen, where it can be absorbed. This can help to alleviate symptoms and improve cognitive function.

The other options are not directly related to the management of NPH:

A. Warfarin therapy is an anticoagulant medication used to prevent stroke and blood clots, but it is not relevant to the patient's symptoms.

B. Vitamin E therapy is sometimes used to slow down cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease, but it is not a treatment for NPH.

Breath sounds are absent on the right side and the neck veins are distended. Telemetry shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Needle thoracostomy.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a tension pneumothorax, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. The tracheal deviation to the left, absent breath sounds on the right side, and distended neck veins are all indicative of a tension pneumothorax. The patient's rapid deterioration in respiratory status and hemodynamic instability also support this diagnosis.

Needle thoracostomy is the best next step in management, as it can help to relieve the tension in the chest cavity and improve the patient's respiratory status. This should be done immediately, as delay can lead to further deterioration and even death.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Discontinuing antibiotics is not relevant to the patient's current crisis.

B. Administering epinephrine may be considered in the setting of anaphylaxis or cardiac arrest, but it is not indicated for tension pneumothorax.

C. Performing an arterial blood gas may provide useful information, but it is not a priority in this emergency situation.

A 22-year-old woman with polycystic ovarian syndrome comes to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of left lower abdominal pain that began suddenly while she was running. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. Physical examination shows tenderness to palpation over the left adnexa and rebound tenderness in the left lower quadrant. There is no tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Urine pregnancy test is negative. An ultrasound is ordered to confirm the diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst. Visualization of fluid in which of the following locations would be most consistent with this diagnosis?,B,"The correct answer is B. Rectouterine pouch.

Rupture of an ovarian cyst typically results in free fluid in the pelvis, which accumulates in the rectouterine pouch (also known as the pouch of Douglas or cul-de-sac). This is the most dependent part of the pelvis in a supine patient, and fluid tends to collect here. The rectouterine pouch is a potential space between the rectum and the uterus, and it is a common location for fluid accumulation in cases of ruptured ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancies, and other pelvic pathology.",Success
"A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She has noticed trembling of her hands for the past 5 months. These movements are only present when she reaches to pick up an object or answer the phone. She has a history of major depressive disorder but has been off medications for the past 3 years. Her father had Parkinson's disease and died 6 months ago. She drinks a glass of wine daily. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 118/74 mm Hg. A low-frequency tremor is present that worsens as she reaches out for an object. She consistently overshoots her target. There is no tremor present when her arms are held outstretched. There is increased tone in the lower extremities and Babinski's sign is positive bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is E. Subthalamic nucleus stroke.

The patient's symptoms, including a low-frequency tremor that worsens as she reaches out for an object, consistent overshooting of her target, and increased tone in the lower extremities with bilateral Babinski's sign, are consistent with a lesion in the subthalamic nucleus, which is a structure involved in motor control and coordination. The subthalamic nucleus is a common location for strokes that can cause tremors and other movement disorders.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms:

A. Cerebellar demyelination would likely cause ataxia, dysmetria, and other cerebellar signs, but not a low-frequency tremor.

B. Degenerated substantia nigra is associated with Parkinson's disease, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms, particularly the presence of a low-frequency tremor that worsens with intention.

C. Degenerated caudate nucleus is associated with Huntington's disease, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

D. Essential tremor is a common movement disorder, but it typically causes a high-frequency tremor that is present at rest and worsens with movement, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.",Success
"A 52-year-old man comes to the physician because of generalized pruritus and raised, erythematous plaques on the skin over his hands, chest, and legs for 6 hours. He reports having clear liquid discharge from his nose and sneezing. He says that his symptoms began suddenly the previous night, 30 minutes after he had dinner at a seafood restaurant. He has had similar symptoms occasionally in the past as well. Four months ago, he had an episode of narrow-angle glaucoma. He takes no medications. His vital signs are within normal limits. Nasal exam shows clear, serous secretions, with edematous and erythematous mucosa and turbinates. Paranasal sinuses are not tender to palpation. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",C,"The correct answer is C. Fexofenadine.

The patient's symptoms, including generalized pruritus, raised erythematous plaques, clear liquid discharge from the nose, and sneezing, are consistent with an allergic reaction, likely to something he ate at the seafood restaurant. The fact that he has had similar symptoms in the past suggests an underlying allergy.

Fexofenadine is a non-sedating antihistamine that is commonly used to treat allergic reactions, including hives and pruritus. It is a good choice for this patient because it is effective in relieving symptoms and has a low risk of side effects.

Diphenhydramine (option A) is also an antihistamine, but it is sedating and may not be as well-tolerated as fexofenadine.

Amoxicillin (option B) is an antibiotic and would not be effective in treating an allergic reaction.

Vitamin K (option D) is not related to the treatment of allergic reactions.

Calamine lotion (option E) is a topical cream used to treat skin irritation and itching, but it would not address the underlying allergic reaction.",Success
"A 19-year-old man in a 3-month relationship with a woman experiences frequent sexual fantasies about male coworkers. He lives in a conservative community and does not know any openly gay men. Two days ago, he joined a local group considered by many organizations to be a hate group. Together with the other members, he attacked a gay couple on their way home from dinner. Which of the following psychological defense mechanisms is he demonstrating?",C,"The correct answer is C. Reaction formation.

The man is experiencing sexual fantasies about men, which suggests that he may have same-sex attractions. However, he lives in a conservative community and has joined a hate group that targets gay people. By attacking a gay couple, he is demonstrating a reaction formation, which is a defense mechanism in which an individual adopts behaviors or attitudes that are opposite of their unconscious desires or impulses. In this case, the man is trying to suppress his own same-sex attractions by acting out against gay people, thereby convincing himself and others that he is not gay.",Success
"A 66-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider with several days of left flank pain radiating to the abdomen and groin. The patient states that she has noticed a pink tinge to her urine as well. Of note, she has not had any fevers, but endorses several months of fatigue and constipation. The patient was previously healthy except for mild untreated hypertension. On exam, her temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 130/84 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 12/min. On further workup, the patient is found to have calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis with hypercalciuria. Blood studies demonstrate increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) and hypercalcemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",A,"The correct answer is A. Primary hyperparathyroidism.

The patient's symptoms of flank pain, radiating to the abdomen and groin, and pink tinge to her urine suggest kidney stones, which is confirmed by the diagnosis of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. The presence of hypercalciuria (excess calcium in the urine) and hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels in the blood) suggests an underlying disorder of calcium metabolism.

The increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in the blood suggest that the parathyroid glands are overactive, leading to excessive calcium release from bones and increased calcium absorption from the gut. This is consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, a condition in which one or more of the parathyroid glands become overactive and produce excessive amounts of PTH.

The other options are not as likely:

B. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a rare genetic disorder characterized by resistance to PTH, leading to hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) and hyperphosphatemia (high phosphate levels). It does not typically present with hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.

C. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism is a rare genetic disorder that is similar to pseudohypoparathyroidism but without the biochemical abnormalities. It is not typically associated with hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.

D. Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs when another underlying condition, such as kidney disease or vitamin D deficiency, leads to increased PTH production. While the patient has kidney stones, there is no indication of underlying kidney disease or vitamin D deficiency.

E. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is a rare condition that occurs when secondary hyperparathyroidism persists for a long time, leading to autonomous parathyroid gland function. It is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.",Success
A 23-year-old woman presents to her psychiatrist concerned about her mood. She has felt tired and unwilling to engage in any activities lately. She states that her limbs feel heavy all the time and that completing any activity takes tremendous effort. She no longer finds any happiness in activities that she previously enjoyed. She also states that she really struggles to sleep and at times can't sleep for several days. The patient is started on appropriate first-line therapy and sent home. She returns 1 week later stating that her symptoms have not improved. She is requesting help as her performance at work and school is suffering. Which of the following is the best next step in management?,D,"The correct answer is D. Continue current therapy.

The patient has been on treatment for only 1 week, which is a relatively short period of time. It's common for antidepressant medications to take 4-6 weeks to start showing significant improvement in symptoms. Therefore, the best next step would be to continue the current therapy and reassess the patient's symptoms in another 2-3 weeks. Adding lithium or changing to a different medication (duloxetine or lithium) may be premature at this point. Electroconvulsive therapy is typically reserved for more severe or treatment-resistant cases, and is not indicated at this stage.",Success
"A 16-year-old patient presents to the physician’s office with an absence of menstruations. Her last period was 6 months ago. Since almost a year and a half ago, she intentionally restricted her diet at the expense of carbohydrates, exercised intensively, and lost 18.0 kg (39.7 lb). She had her menarche at the age of 12 and menstruated normally until last year. She is not sexually active. On physical examination, the vital signs include blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate 55/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature 35.9°C (96.6°F). Her weight is 55.0 kg (121.3 lb), and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in). Physical examination reveals the good development of muscles and decreased adiposity. A bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits. Which statement about this patient’s condition is correct?",C,"The correct answer is C. Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest that she has developed amenorrhea (cessation of menstruation) due to excessive weight loss and decreased body fat. The decreased adiposity is likely contributing to hypoestrogenemia (low estrogen levels), which is disrupting her menstrual cycle. This is because adipose tissue is a source of estrogen production, and with decreased body fat, estrogen levels may be reduced.

The other options are not correct:

A. Hypertrophied muscles are not a source of androgens that would interfere with the menstrual cycle.

B. Insulin resistance is not directly related to the patient's amenorrhea.

D. Decreased liver metabolism is not a likely cause of decreased estrogen levels in this patient.

E. Hyperthyroidism is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms, and extensive lipolysis is not typically associated with thyroid hyperfunction.",Success

Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Abdominal ultrasonography show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?""",A,"The correct answer is A. Factitious disorder.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a factitious disorder, also known as Munchausen syndrome. The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease and is taking omeprazole, but the current symptoms are not consistent with a gastrointestinal disorder. The patient's request for a diagnostic laparoscopy and her statement ""I know I have cancer"" suggest a desire for medical attention and treatment.

The physical examination findings, such as pale conjunctivae, dry mucous membranes, and crusts along the course of her left arm veins, are consistent with self-induced bleeding or injection of substances into the veins. The laboratory results, including a low hemoglobin level, high reticulocyte count, and normal electrolyte levels, support the diagnosis of factitious disorder.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Somatic symptom disorder (option B) is a diagnosis that is made when a patient has excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to their symptoms, but the patient's symptoms are not intentionally produced or feigned. Conversion disorder (option C) is a diagnosis that is made when a patient has a neurological symptom that cannot be explained by a medical condition, but the patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis. Primary hyperparathyroidism (option D) is a diagnosis that is made when a patient has an overactive parathyroid gland, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Abdominal ultrasonography shows an enlarged liver. A biopsy of the liver shows massive centrilobular necrosis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?""",A,"The correct answer is A. Adverse effect of anesthetic.

The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and liver biopsy findings are consistent with halothane-induced hepatitis, a rare but serious adverse effect of halothane anesthesia. The presence of eosinophilia (13% eosinophils) and the massive centrilobular necrosis on liver biopsy support this diagnosis.

Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Bone marrow biopsy.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, a condition characterized by pancytopenia (low blood cell counts) due to bone marrow failure. The patient's low hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count, as well as the low reticulocyte count, are consistent with this diagnosis.

A bone marrow biopsy is the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis of aplastic anemia by showing a hypocellular bone marrow with a decreased number of hematopoietic stem cells.

The other options are not directly related to confirming the diagnosis of aplastic anemia:

A. Serum transferrin level is related to iron metabolism and is not specific to aplastic anemia.

C. Flow cytometry is a test used to analyze the characteristics of cells, but it is not typically used to diagnose aplastic anemia.

"A 35-year-old man returns to the clinic to follow up for his chronic stomach pain. At the last visit a few months ago, he explained that he had been experiencing discomfort in his upper abdomen for awhile. He had never vomited up any blood and had not had any substantial weight loss. He did not take any medications, did not smoke, and had no family history of gastric cancer. At that time, the doctor empirically started him on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Today, despite the PPI, the patient says he is still experiencing discomfort. Hearing this, the doctor decides to order a urease breath test. What is the most likely cause of this patient's chronic stomach pain?",D,"The correct answer is D. Helicobacter pylori infection.

The patient's symptoms of chronic stomach pain, particularly in the upper abdomen, and the lack of response to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, suggest that the cause of the pain may not be related to acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The doctor's decision to order a urease breath test, which is a diagnostic test for H. pylori infection, suggests that H. pylori is a likely cause of the patient's symptoms. H. pylori infection is a common cause of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, and it can cause chronic stomach pain.",Success

She has no history of sexually transmitted disease, intravenous drug use, or blood transfusions, and she has never traveled outside of the United States. She was up-to-date on all immunizations before her pregnancy. Ultrasound is consistent with an 8-week gestational sac. The patient requests as few tests as possible, although she does not want to compromise the health of her fetus. Which of the following screening tests should be performed on all pregnant women?",A,"The correct answer is A. HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend that all pregnant women be screened for HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B. This is because these infections can have serious consequences for the mother and the fetus if left untreated, and early detection and treatment can significantly improve outcomes.

While Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis are also important infections to screen for in pregnant women, they are not universally recommended for all pregnant women. Screening for these infections is typically targeted towards women who are at high risk, such as those with a history of sexually transmitted infections or those who are under 25 years old.

His wife also says that he has begun to doubt her fidelity and believes that even the marriage counselor is on her side. Which of the following psychiatric disorders also belongs to the same cluster of symptoms?,A,"The correct answer is D. Narcissistic personality disorder.

The patient's symptoms, such as being critical of others, having a sense of entitlement, being quick to take offense, and having a lack of empathy, are all characteristic of narcissistic personality disorder. Additionally, the patient's tendency to blame others (e.g., his boss) and his suspiciousness of others' motives (e.g., his wife's fidelity) are also consistent with this diagnosis.

"A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by the police. He was found unconscious and covered in bruises outside of a local bar. The patient has a past medical history of polysubstance abuse, depression, multiple suicide attempts, neuropathic pain, and schizophrenia. As part of the patient’s initial workup, a head CT is performed which is unremarkable, and an arterial blood gas is performed as seen below:

pH: 7.29
PaCO2: 95 mm Hg
PaO2: 70 mm Hg
Bicarbonate: 24 mEq/L

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s current presentation?",E,"The correct answer is B. Amitriptyline.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a respiratory acidosis, with a pH of 7.29, a PaCO2 of 95 mm Hg, and a bicarbonate level of 24 mEq/L. This suggests that the patient has a decreased respiratory drive, leading to a buildup of CO2 in the blood.

Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is known to cause respiratory depression, particularly in overdose situations. The patient's history of depression and previous suicide attempts make amitriptyline a likely culprit.

Alcohol (A) can also cause respiratory depression, but it would typically cause a metabolic acidosis, not a respiratory acidosis.

Cocaine (C) is a stimulant and would not typically cause respiratory depression.

Ethylene glycol (D) is a toxic substance that can cause a metabolic acidosis, but it would not typically cause a respiratory acidosis.

Heroin (E) is an opioid that can cause respiratory depression, but it would typically cause a more severe respiratory acidosis than what is seen in this patient's ABG results.

Therefore, based on the patient's history and ABG results, amitriptyline overdose is the most likely etiology of this patient's current presentation.",Success
"A 3-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents for an acute arm injury. The mother reports that they were walking in the park and the patient’s dad was swinging the patient in the air by her arms. The dad reports he then heard a click and the patient immediately began to cry. On examination, the patient is holding her right forearm in a pronated position and her elbow slightly flexed. Pain is localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow. She refuses to use the affected limb. She does allow passive flexion and extension with full range of motion but supination is limited and causes pain. Which of the following is the next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is D. Radiograph.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a radial head subluxation, also known as a ""nursemaid's elbow"". This is a common injury in young children, typically occurring when the forearm is pulled or jerked, causing the radial head to slip out of place.

Before proceeding with any treatment, it is essential to rule out any other potential injuries or fractures, such as a radial head fracture or elbow dislocation. Therefore, the next step in management is to obtain a radiograph (X-ray) of the elbow to confirm the diagnosis and exclude any other injuries.

After the radiograph, if the diagnosis of radial head subluxation is confirmed, the treatment would typically involve a reduction maneuver, such as hyperpronation (option B) or supination and maximal extension (option E). Immobilization (option A) may be necessary if the reduction is unsuccessful or if there is an associated fracture. Open reduction (option C) is not typically necessary for a radial head subluxation.",Success
A 40-year-old male presents to your office complaining that he is too weak to climb stairs or brush his hair. He denies any headaches or change in vision. A muscle biopsy reveals CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,D,"The correct answer is D. Polymyositis.

The presence of CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium on muscle biopsy is a characteristic feature of polymyositis. This is a type of inflammatory myopathy that affects the skeletal muscles, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. The patient's symptoms of weakness in climbing stairs and brushing hair are consistent with polymyositis.

In contrast, dermatomyositis (option E) typically presents with a characteristic skin rash, which is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms. Systemic lupus erythematosus (option A) and scleroderma (option B) are systemic autoimmune diseases that can cause muscle weakness, but they are less likely to present with isolated muscle symptoms and CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration on muscle biopsy. Polymyalgia rheumatica (option C) is a condition that causes muscle pain and stiffness, but it is typically seen in older adults and is not associated with CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration on muscle biopsy.",Success

He was born at 38 weeks gestation via a spontaneous vaginal delivery without any complications. The mother said that the patient appeared ""normal"" until the past few weeks. On physical exam, his extraocular muscle movements are intact, and a symmetric smile is seen. He has symmetric flaccid weakness of both his upper and lower extremities. He also has a bell-shaped chest. Deep tendon reflexes are diminished. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Anterior horn cell degeneration.

The patient's symptoms, including weak cry and suck, symmetric flaccid weakness of both upper and lower extremities, and diminished deep tendon reflexes, are consistent with a diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is a genetic disorder that affects the anterior horn cells, which are the motor neurons responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement. The anterior horn cells degenerate, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms:

B. Axonal demyelination is a feature of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, which would not typically present with symmetric flaccid weakness and diminished reflexes in a 6-month-old infant.

C. Decreased acetylcholine receptor density is a feature of myasthenia gravis, which would typically present with fatigable weakness, not symmetric flaccid weakness.

D. Impaired acetylcholine release is a feature of botulism, which would typically present with a descending pattern of weakness, not symmetric flaccid weakness.

E. Myonecrosis is a feature of muscle damage or injury, which would not typically present with the patient's symptoms.

His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 180/min, and respirations are 50/min. Examination shows mild diaphoresis and a firm 2-cm midline neck swelling. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. Methimazole and propranolol therapy.

The symptoms described, such as irritability, restlessness, frequent bowel movements, and a rapid heart rate, are consistent with neonatal thyrotoxicosis. The presence of a firm midline neck swelling suggests a goiter, which is a common finding in neonatal thyrotoxicosis. The mother's history of Graves' disease and treatment with propylthiouracil during pregnancy increases the risk of neonatal thyrotoxicosis.

Methimazole and propranolol are commonly used to treat neonatal thyrotoxicosis. Methimazole is a thionamide that inhibits the production of thyroid hormones, while propranolol is a beta-blocker that helps to control the symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, such as tachycardia and tremors.

The other options are not correct because:

* Digoxin and furosemide therapy (option B) would be used to treat heart failure, which is not the primary diagnosis in this case.
* Potassium iodide therapy (option C) may be used to treat thyrotoxic crisis, but it is not the first-line treatment for neonatal thyrotoxicosis.

Two weeks ago, he had several days of fever and bloody diarrhea, for which he was treated with antibiotics. Examination shows a small left knee effusion and bilateral conjunctival injection. Which of the following is the most likely additional finding in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon.

The patient's symptoms, including burning with urination, joint pain and swelling, and conjunctival injection, are consistent with reactive arthritis (ReA), a type of arthritis that occurs in response to an infection, often in the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. The patient's history of fever and bloody diarrhea two weeks prior to the onset of joint symptoms suggests that the arthritis is a reaction to a preceding infection.

Tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon is a common finding in reactive arthritis, particularly in the heel and Achilles tendon. This is due to enthesitis, inflammation at the site where tendons or ligaments insert into bone.

The other options are not directly related to reactive arthritis:

A. A circular erythematous rash with central clearing is characteristic of erythema migrans, a rash seen in Lyme disease.

"A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a painless lump on her neck for 3 months that has increased in size. She appears healthy. Examination shows a 2.5-cm (1-in) firm, irregular swelling on the left side of the neck that moves with swallowing. There is painless cervical lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound of the neck shows a solitary left lobe thyroid mass with increased vascularity and hyperechogenic punctate regions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy is scheduled for the following week. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.

The description of the mass as firm, irregular, and having increased vascularity and hyperechogenic punctate regions on ultrasound is consistent with papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Additionally, the patient's age and the presence of painless cervical lymphadenopathy also support this diagnosis. Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and typically affects young adults. It often presents as a solitary thyroid nodule that moves with swallowing, and may be associated with cervical lymph node metastases.",Success
"A 34-year-old man currently staying at an addiction center presents to the staff psychiatrist with diarrhea and painful muscle cramps. He has been discontinuing heroin over the last month as part of his treatment plan. He is HIV positive, hepatitis B (HBV) positive, and was recently treated for an infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. He reports pain over his abdomen, knees, and shoulder. To comprehensively treat these symptoms, which of the following would be the best therapy?",A,"The correct answer is A. Methadone.

The patient is experiencing withdrawal symptoms from heroin, including diarrhea and painful muscle cramps. Methadone is a medication that can be used to treat opioid withdrawal symptoms and is often used in medication-assisted treatment (MAT) programs for opioid addiction. It can help to reduce the severity of withdrawal symptoms and cravings for opioids.

Naloxone (option B) is an opioid antagonist that is used to reverse opioid overdose, but it would not be effective in treating withdrawal symptoms.

Alvimopan (option C) is a medication that is used to treat opioid-induced constipation, but it would not address the patient's muscle cramps and abdominal pain.

Morphine (option D) is an opioid medication that could potentially worsen the patient's addiction and is not a suitable treatment for opioid withdrawal.

Loperamide (option E) is an antidiarrheal medication that may help to treat diarrhea, but it would not address the patient's muscle cramps and abdominal pain, and would not be a comprehensive treatment for opioid withdrawal.",Success
"A 26-year-old man presents to his physician with a history of diarrhea and vomiting for the past 24 hours. On physical examination, his temperature is 36.9ºC (98.4ºF), pulse rate is 110/min, blood pressure is 102/74 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 16/min. A resident working under the physician plots a Darrow-Yannet diagram for the patient. The diagram is shown in the picture where the green dotted line represents the new fluid status. Which of the following is most likely to show increased secretion in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is E. Vasoactive intestinal peptide.

The Darrow-Yannet diagram shows a state of dehydration with a contracted extracellular fluid volume, as indicated by the green dotted line. This is consistent with the patient's symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting.

Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a hormone that stimulates the secretion of electrolytes and water into the intestinal lumen, leading to diarrhea. In this patient, the increased secretion of VIP is likely contributing to the diarrhea and dehydration.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the Darrow-Yannet diagram:

A. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a hormone that regulates blood pressure and volume, but it is not directly related to diarrhea or dehydration.

B. Bradykinin is a peptide that causes blood vessels to dilate, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

C. Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells, but it is not related to the patient's symptoms or the Darrow-Yannet diagram.

D. Renin is an enzyme that regulates blood pressure, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the Darrow-Yannet diagram.",Success
"A 28-year-old female comes to the physician’s office with a complaint of episodic chest pain. She describes the pain as squeezing and tightness in her chest. This pain has been happening every few days for 3 months. She says there is no association of the pain with food or exercise. She is able to climb up to her fourth floor apartment daily without issue. Her only past medical history is migraines for which she takes appropriate medication. Here temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. She has no known family history. The patient is not in pain on presentation and EKG in the office is normal. 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely. The mechanism of this patient’s chest pain is most similar to the mechanism behind which of the following?",A,"The correct answer is A. Raynaud's phenomenon.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the episodic chest pain with transient ST elevations on 24-hour ECG monitoring, are consistent with Prinzmetal's angina, also known as variant angina. This condition is caused by vasospasm of the coronary arteries, leading to temporary reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle. The mechanism of Prinzmetal's angina is similar to that of Raynaud's phenomenon, which is a condition characterized by vasospasm of the arteries in the fingers and toes, typically in response to cold temperatures or stress. Both conditions involve abnormal vasoreactivity and vasospasm, leading to episodic symptoms.",Success
"A 22-year-old gravida 1 presents to her physician at 15 weeks gestation for a prenatal appointment. She complains of a rash involving her chest, face, and arms, a watery nasal discharge, and mild bilateral knee pain. She has had these symptoms for about 5 days. The symptoms do not seem to bother her too much, but she is concerned for the baby. She had contact with her younger sister, who also had a rash and was diagnosed with rubella infection about 10 days ago at a family gathering. She cannot confirm her vaccination history. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 89/min; respiratory rate, 12/min; and temperature, 37.6℃ (99.7℉). Examination shows a moderately dense maculopapular lacy rash spread over the patient’s trunk, extremities, and face. No lymph node, liver, or spleen enlargement is noted. The knee joints appear normal.
Serology performed 1 year ago Current serology
Rubella IgM - negative Rubella IgM - negative
Rubella IgG - 1:128 Rubella IgG - 1:64
Rubella IgG avidity - high Rubella IgG avidity - high
What is the proper next step in the management of this woman?",D,"The correct answer is A. Reassure and recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with a viral infection, but the serology results indicate that she is immune to rubella. The presence of rubella IgG antibodies with high avidity suggests that she has had a previous infection or vaccination, and the lack of IgM antibodies indicates that she is not currently infected. The decrease in IgG titer from 1:128 to 1:64 is not significant, as it is still within the range of immunity.

Given that the patient is immune to rubella, there is no risk of transmission to the fetus, and pregnancy termination is not necessary. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is not indicated, as there is no concern about fetal infection. While parvovirus B19 can cause a similar rash, it is not necessary to test for it in this case, as the patient's symptoms are likely due to another viral infection. Rubella virus PCR is also not necessary, as the patient is not infected with rubella.

The proper next step is to reassure the patient that she is immune to rubella and that her symptoms are likely due to another viral infection. She should be advised to receive vaccination against rubella postpartum to ensure that she remains immune in the future.",Success
"A 20-year-old woman presents with vaginal discharge, pruritus, and painful micturition for the past 5 days. She is sexually active with multiple partners and admits to using barrier protection inconsistently. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. The patient denies any fever, chills, abdominal pain, menorrhagia, or flank pain. She is afebrile and the vital signs are within normal limits. Speculum examination reveals vaginal erythema with a profuse, greenish-yellow, purulent, malodorous discharge. The vaginal pH is 5.5. Vaginal swab and urine samples are obtained for microscopy and culture, and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient based on her presentation?",D,"The correct answer is D. Trichomonal vaginitis.

The patient's symptoms of vaginal discharge, pruritus, and painful micturition, along with the physical examination findings of vaginal erythema and a profuse, greenish-yellow, purulent, and malodorous discharge, are consistent with trichomonal vaginitis. The vaginal pH of 5.5 also supports this diagnosis, as Trichomonas vaginalis infections are often associated with an elevated vaginal pH.

While the other options are possible causes of vaginal discharge and discomfort, they are less likely based on the patient's presentation:

* A. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is unlikely, as the patient denies fever, chills, and abdominal pain, and the physical examination does not suggest a UTI.
* B. Candida vaginitis typically presents with a thick, white, cottage-cheese-like discharge, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.
* C. Bacterial vaginosis often presents with a thin, white or grayish discharge, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.
* E. Chlamydia infection is a possible cause of vaginal discharge and painful micturition, but it is often asymptomatic, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with trichomonal vaginitis.",Success
"A 47-year-old female undergoes a thyroidectomy for treatment of Graves' disease. Post-operatively, she reports a hoarse voice and difficulty speaking. You suspect that this is likely a complication of her recent surgery. What is the embryologic origin of the damaged nerve that is most likely causing this patient's hoarseness?",E,"The correct answer is E. 6th pharyngeal arch.

The nerve that is most likely damaged in this patient is the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is responsible for controlling the muscles of the larynx and vocal cords. The recurrent laryngeal nerve is derived from the 6th pharyngeal arch.

Here's a brief review of the pharyngeal arches and their corresponding nerves:

* 1st pharyngeal arch: trigeminal nerve (V)

Physical examination demonstrates wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields. The child is started on supplemental oxygen and a nebulized bronchodilator. Which of the following is a downstream effect of this medication?",E,"The correct answer is E. Increased adenylate cyclase activity.

The nebulized bronchodilator being referred to is likely a beta2-agonist, such as albuterol. Beta2-agonists work by binding to beta2 receptors in the lungs, which activates adenylate cyclase, an enzyme that converts ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP). The increase in cAMP leads to relaxation of airway smooth muscle, resulting in bronchodilation and relief of asthma symptoms.",Success

Which of the following is the best diagnostic test to guide current therapy in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Urine antigen test.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease, a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila. The patient's fever, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and confusion are all consistent with this diagnosis. The laboratory results, including the patient's leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and elevated creatinine, also support this diagnosis.

The urine antigen test is a rapid and sensitive test that can detect the presence of Legionella antigen in the urine. It is a useful diagnostic test for guiding therapy in patients with suspected Legionnaires' disease. The other options are not as specific or sensitive for diagnosing Legionnaires' disease.

Blood cultures (A) may be useful for diagnosing bacteremia, but they are not specific for Legionnaires' disease. Chest radiography (B) may show abnormalities consistent with pneumonia, but it is not a specific diagnostic test for Legionnaires' disease.

Acid-fast stain Negative
 Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Valley fever.

The patient's symptoms, including chronic cough, aching joints, and malaise, are consistent with coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley fever. The patient's travel history to the desert near Phoenix, Arizona, is also a strong risk factor for this disease. The chest X-ray and CT findings, including a right-sided consolidation and pleural effusion, are also consistent with coccidioidomycosis.

The lung biopsy results, which show necrotic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores, are characteristic of coccidioidomycosis. The positive periodic acid-Schiff and silver methenamine stains also support this diagnosis.

The other options are not as likely based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Histoplasmosis (A) is a possibility, but it is less common in the desert southwest and the biopsy findings are not as characteristic of this disease. Mycetoma (B) is a fungal infection that typically causes skin and soft tissue lesions, and is not as likely to cause the patient's pulmonary symptoms. Blastomycosis (C) is a fungal infection that can cause pulmonary symptoms, but it is more common in the southeastern United States and the biopsy findings are not as characteristic of this disease.

Physical exam is notable for facial asymmetry and 4/5 strength in the patient's upper and lower extremity. A CT scan of the head does not demonstrate an intracranial bleed. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Exchange transfusion.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with a stroke, which is a common complication of sickle cell disease. The CT scan rules out an intracranial bleed, suggesting an ischemic stroke. Exchange transfusion is the most appropriate treatment for acute ischemic stroke in patients with sickle cell disease, as it helps to reduce the concentration of sickled red blood cells and improve blood flow to the affected area.

Alteplase (A) is a thrombolytic agent that is used to treat acute ischemic stroke in general, but it is not specifically indicated for sickle cell disease.

Heparin (C) and warfarin (E) are anticoagulants that are used to prevent stroke, but they are not typically used to treat acute ischemic stroke in patients with sickle cell disease.

Rales are heard bilaterally on cardiopulmonary examination. Cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is A. Karyotyping of infant's chromosomes.

The symptoms described in the question, such as the infant's failure to thrive, productive cough, and oral thrush (white plaques on the tongue and palate), are consistent with a diagnosis of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). SCID is a genetic disorder that affects the immune system, and it is often associated with chromosomal abnormalities.

Karyotyping of the infant's chromosomes would be the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis of SCID, as it would allow for the identification of any chromosomal abnormalities that may be contributing to the condition.

The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis of SCID:

* B. DNA test for CFTR mutation: This test is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, a different genetic disorder.
* C. Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test: This test is used to diagnose syphilis, a bacterial infection.
* D. Polymerase chain reaction for viral genes: This test is used to detect viral infections, but it is not specific to SCID.
* E. T-cell receptor excision circle analysis: This test is used to diagnose SCID, but it is not as comprehensive as karyotyping, which can identify a wider range of chromosomal abnormalities.",Success

Anti-smooth muscle antibody negative
Anti-CMV antibody negative
Anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibody negative
An ELISA for HIV is negative. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""",E,"The correct answer is E. Anti-HEV IgM.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with acute hepatitis, and the travel history to Sudan suggests the possibility of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection. HEV is a common cause of acute hepatitis in developing countries, and it can be particularly severe in pregnant women.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase, which are consistent with acute hepatitis. The negative results for anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-CMV antibody, and anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibody rule out autoimmune hepatitis and other viral causes of hepatitis.

HBsAg (option A) would be positive in hepatitis B virus infection, which is not consistent with the patient's travel history and symptoms. Anti-HAV IgG (option B) would indicate previous hepatitis A virus infection, which is not consistent with the patient's acute symptoms. HCV RNA (option C) would be positive in hepatitis C virus infection, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Anti-HCV IgG (option D) would indicate previous hepatitis C virus infection, which is not consistent with the patient's acute symptoms.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?",D,"The correct answer is D. Accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition caused by the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space. The patient's worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, and fever suggest an acute process. The physical examination findings of jugular venous distention, pitting edema, and a drop in blood pressure during inspiration (pulsus paradoxus) are all consistent with cardiac tamponade.

Option A, dilation of the atria and ventricles, may cause heart failure, but it would not explain the patient's pulsus paradoxus or jugular venous distention.

Option B, accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity, could cause shortness of breath, but it would not explain the patient's pulsus paradoxus or jugular venous distention.

Option C, occlusion of a coronary artery, could cause chest pain, but it would not explain the patient's shortness of breath, fever, or physical examination findings.

Ca2+: 10.9 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best explanation of this patient's current presentation?",B,"The correct answer is A. Furosemide.

The patient's presentation with shortness of breath, cough, and bipedal edema suggests acute pulmonary edema, which is likely caused by diuretic-induced hypokalemia (low potassium levels). The patient's potassium level is 3.2 mEq/L, which is below the normal range.

Furosemide is a loop diuretic that can cause hypokalemia, especially in patients with heart failure or those who are taking other medications that can lower potassium levels. The patient's history of taking lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, and metformin, which can also lower potassium levels, increases the likelihood that furosemide is the culprit.

The other options are not supported by the patient's presentation and lab values:

B. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that can cause hypokalemia, but it is not as potent as furosemide in causing potassium depletion.

C. Renal tubular acidosis type I (RTA I) is a disorder characterized by a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and alkaline urine. While the patient has hypokalemia, the pH and bicarbonate levels are normal, making RTA I less likely.

D. Renal tubular acidosis type II (RTA II) is a disorder characterized by a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and acidic urine. The patient's urine pH is not provided, but the normal bicarbonate level makes RTA II less likely.

E. Renal tubular acidosis type IV (RTA IV) is a disorder characterized by a hyperkalemic metabolic acidosis, which is the opposite of the patient's presentation.",Success

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, including fatigue, shortness of breath, conjunctival pallor, and echinocytes on peripheral blood smear, suggest a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis, a red blood cell membrane disorder. This condition is often associated with a deficiency of the enzyme glycolytic pathway enzyme, phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1).

PFK-1 is the rate-limiting enzyme of the glycolytic pathway, and it is inhibited by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, a key regulator of glycolysis. The other options are not correct:

A. ATP is not a stimulator of PFK-1.

B. Citrate is an inhibitor of PFK-1, not a stimulator.

C. Protein kinase A activity does not directly affect PFK-1.

E. AMP is an activator of PFK-1, not an inhibitor.",Success
"A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because she feels depressed, has difficulty sleeping, a poor appetite, and low concentration for the past 3 months. During this time, she has also had low energy and lost interest in playing the guitar. During high school, the patient went through similar episodes of low mood and poor sleep. At that time, she would repeatedly engage in binge eating and purging behavior, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. The physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should most be avoided in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Bupropion.

The patient has a history of binge eating and purging behavior, which suggests a history of bulimia nervosa. Bupropion is contraindicated in patients with a history of eating disorders, particularly bulimia nervosa, as it can increase the risk of seizures in these individuals. Therefore, it should be avoided in this patient.

The other options are not contraindicated in this patient:

A. Duloxetine is an antidepressant that can be used to treat depression and anxiety.

B. Trazodone is a sedating antidepressant that can be used to treat depression and insomnia.

D. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant that can be used to treat depression and anxiety, and it can also help with sleep.

E. Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that can be used to treat depression and anxiety.",Success
"A 5-month-old boy is brought to the physician with a 3-day history of fever and cough. His mother reports that he has had multiple episodes of loose stools over the past 3 months. He has been treated for otitis media 4 times and bronchiolitis 3 times since birth. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation, and the neonatal period was uncomplicated. He is at the 10th percentile for height and 3rd percentile for weight. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 126/min, and respirations are 35/min. Examination shows an erythematous scaly rash over his trunk and extremities. The white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa bleed when scraped. Inspiratory crackles are heard in the right lung base. An X-ray of the chest shows an infiltrate in the right lower lobe and an absent thymic shadow. Which of the following is the most likely definitive treatment for this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Hematopoietic cell transplantation.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of functional T cells and B cells. The presence of an erythematous scaly rash, white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa that bleed when scraped, and an absent thymic shadow on chest X-ray are all indicative of SCID.

Hematopoietic cell transplantation is the most likely definitive treatment for SCID, as it can restore immune function by replacing the defective immune cells with healthy ones. This is often the only curative treatment option for SCID.

The other options are not correct because:

* Interferon-γ therapy is used to treat chronic granulomatous disease, not SCID.
* Intravenous immune globulin may be used to provide temporary immune protection, but it is not a definitive treatment for SCID.
* Leucovorin supplementation is used to treat megaloblastic anemia, not SCID.
* Thymic transplantation may be considered in some cases of SCID, but it is not the most likely definitive treatment.",Success
"Six days after undergoing an aortic valve replacement surgery, a 68-year-old woman has bluish discolorations around the peripheral intravenous catheters and severe right leg pain. She has a history of hypertension and major depressive disorder. She drinks 3 beers daily. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, prophylactic unfractionated heparin, and fluoxetine. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 118/92 mm Hg. Examination shows multiple hematomas on the upper extremities around the peripheral intravenous access sites. There is a healing sternal incision. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows an aortic click. The right calf is tender, erythematous and swollen. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 13.1 g/dL

γ-Glutamyl transferase 45 U/L (N=5–50 U/L)
Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?""",E,"The correct answer is D. Excess circulating thrombin.

The patient's symptoms, including bluish discolorations around the peripheral intravenous catheters and severe right leg pain, are consistent with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The laboratory results show a low platelet count, which is a hallmark of HIT. The patient's history of receiving prophylactic unfractionated heparin after aortic valve replacement surgery also supports this diagnosis.

HIT is caused by the formation of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) in response to heparin administration. These antibodies activate platelets, leading to thrombocytopenia and a prothrombotic state. The excess circulating thrombin is a result of the platelet activation and the subsequent formation of thrombin.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors would not cause thrombocytopenia or the patient's symptoms.

B. Phagocytosis of autoantibody-opsonized platelets is a mechanism of immune thrombocytopenia, but it is not related to heparin administration.

C. Deficiency of von Willebrand factor would not cause thrombocytopenia or the patient's symptoms.

E. Autoantibody-mediated platelet activation is a mechanism of immune thrombocytopenia, but it is not directly related to heparin administration or the patient's symptoms.",Success
A 55-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B virus infection comes to the physician because of generalized fatigue and a 5.4 kg (12 lb) weight loss over the past 4 months. Physical examination shows hepatomegaly. Laboratory studies show an α-fetoprotein concentration of 380 ng/ml (N < 10 ng/mL). A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast shows a solitary mass in the left lobe of the liver that enhances in the arterial phase. Which of the following is the most likely underlying pathogenesis of this patient's current condition?,E,"The correct answer is E. Integration of foreign DNA into host genome.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is a common complication of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The integration of HBV DNA into the host genome is a key step in the development of HCC. This integration can lead to the activation of oncogenes, the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, and the disruption of cellular signaling pathways, ultimately resulting in the development of cancer.",Success
"A 28-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presents to her primary care physician with increased menstrual bleeding over the past three months. She also notes easy bruising and bleeding from her gums when brushing her teeth. She is sexually active with multiple partners and has no history of intravenous drug use. Physical exam is remarkable for petechiae and scattered ecchymoses on the patient's bilateral upper and lower extremities. Urine beta-HCG is negative. Laboratory results are as follows: Hgb 13.0 g/dL, WBCs 6,000/mL, platelets 95,000/mL, PT 13.2s, aPTT 30s. Peripheral blood smear shows normocytic, normochromic red blood cells and few platelets with no morphologic abnormalities. Which diagnostic study should be performed next?",D,"The correct answer is D. HIV and HCV testing.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which is an autoimmune disorder characterized by low platelet count and mucocutaneous bleeding. The patient's history of multiple sexual partners and lack of intravenous drug use increases the likelihood of HIV or HCV infection, which can cause ITP. Therefore, HIV and HCV testing should be performed next to rule out these underlying infections.

The other options are not the next best step in the diagnosis:

A. Serum factor VIII levels and von Willebrand factor activity would be useful in diagnosing bleeding disorders such as hemophilia A or von Willebrand disease, but are not relevant to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

B. Vitamin B12 and folate levels would be useful in diagnosing megaloblastic anemia, but are not relevant to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

C. Measurement of ADAMTS13 activity would be useful in diagnosing thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are more consistent with ITP.

E. Bone marrow aspiration may be useful in diagnosing bone marrow disorders, but is not necessary at this point in the diagnosis and would not provide information about the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.",Success
"A 6-year-old boy is brought in by his parents to a pediatrician’s office for persistent fever. His temperature has ranged from 38.6°C–39.5°C (101.5°F–103.1°F) over the past week. He was diagnosed with a gene defect on chromosome 7, which has caused dysfunction in a transmembrane protein. This defect has resulted in several hospitalizations for various respiratory infections. At the present time, he is struggling with a cough with thick purulent sputum. A sputum sample is sent for culture and the patient is started on vancomycin.The pediatrician tells the patient’s family that there is a collection of mucus in the respiratory tree which increases the patient's chances of future infections. He will have to undergo chest physiotherapy and they should report any signs of infection immediately to a medical professional. Which of the following pathogens will most likely infect this patient in adulthood?",B,"The correct answer is B. Pseudomonas.

The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that they have cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder caused by a defect in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7. This defect leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus that clogs the airways and digestive tract, making it difficult to breathe and digest food.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen that infects the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis, particularly in adulthood. It is a Gram-negative bacterium that thrives in the thick mucus of the CF airways, causing chronic lung infections and exacerbations.

While Staphylococcus aureus (option A) can also infect people with cystic fibrosis, it is more commonly associated with skin and soft tissue infections. Burkholderia cepacia (option C) is another pathogen that can infect people with CF, but it is less common than Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Influenza (option D) is a viral infection that can affect anyone, regardless of their underlying health conditions. Candida (option E) is a fungal pathogen that can cause infections in people with compromised immune systems, but it is not typically associated with cystic fibrosis.",Success
"An 8-week-old male presents with his mother to the pediatrician for a well visit. The patient has been breastfed since birth, and usually feeds for 30 minutes every 2-3 hours. The patient’s mother is concerned that her milk production is not keeping up with the patient’s nutritional requirements. She reports that about two weeks ago the patient began regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds. She reports that he seems mildly upset during the episodes of regurgitation but usually settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. The patient’s mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of the regurgitation. She denies any diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. Her older son had a similar problem with vomiting that resolved around 12 months of age. Four weeks ago, the patient’s height and weight were in the 40th and 34th percentiles, respectively. His height and weight are now respectively in the 37th and 36th percentiles. On physical exam, the patient is cooing in his mother’s lap and smiles reciprocally with her. He lifts his head and shoulders off the examination table when placed in the supine position. His abdomen is soft, non-tender and non-distended. Bowel sounds are normoactive.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Reassurance and counseling on positioning.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with physiologic reflux, which is common in infants. The fact that the patient is growing well, is not distressed, and settles down quickly after regurgitation episodes suggests that the reflux is not causing any significant harm. The mother's attempt to limit the volume of each feed has already reduced the frequency of regurgitation, which further supports the diagnosis of physiologic reflux.

Reassurance and counseling on positioning, such as burping the baby during and after feeds, keeping the baby upright after feeds, and avoiding overfeeding, are likely to be effective in managing the symptoms. There is no indication for initiating proton pump inhibitors, obtaining an abdominal ultrasound, modifying the mother's diet, or switching to hydrolyzed formula at this point.",Success
"A 27-year-old gentleman is brought into the ED after being stabbed in the back by a knife. In addition to the pain from the wound, he complains of weakness in his left leg. Upon physical examination you find that he has no other visible injuries; however, he has 2/5 strength in the left lower extremity. Complete neurologic exam also finds a deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity as well as a loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity. Which of the following lesions would result in the syndrome described?",D,"The correct answer is D. Left cord hemisection.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with a left cord hemisection, also known as Brown-Séquard syndrome. This is a rare condition that occurs when there is a lesion that damages one half of the spinal cord, resulting in a specific pattern of neurological deficits.

The key features of Brown-Séquard syndrome are:

* Ipsilateral (same side) weakness and loss of proprioception (position sense), vibration, and light touch
* Contralateral (opposite side) loss of pain and temperature sensation

In this case, the patient has:

* Weakness in the left leg (ipsilateral)
* Deficits in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity (ipsilateral)
* Loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity (contralateral)

This pattern of deficits is consistent with a lesion affecting the left half of the spinal cord, which is why the correct answer is D. Left cord hemisection.",Success

Fasting blood glucose is 90 mg/dL. Which of the following preventative screening tests would be most appropriate for this patient at this time?",A,"The correct answer is C. HbA1C.

The patient has a family history of diabetes mellitus type 2 in his mother, and his BMI is 30 kg/m2, which puts him at risk for developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening for diabetes in adults with a BMI ≥25 kg/m2 and at least one additional risk factor, such as a family history of diabetes.

"A 34-year-old patient is brought to the emergency room after a motor vehicle accident. An EKG shows sinus tachycardia and chest radiograph reveals an enlarged cardiac silhouette. While observing sinus tachycardia on the patient's telemetry, you note that the radial pulse cannot be palpated during inspiration. What should be the next step in management of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is D. Pericardial window.

The patient's symptoms and test results suggest cardiac tamponade, a life-threatening condition caused by fluid accumulation in the pericardial space. The radial pulse that disappears during inspiration (pulsus paradoxus) is a classic sign of cardiac tamponade.

A pericardial window is a surgical procedure that involves creating a window in the pericardium to drain the accumulated fluid and relieve the pressure on the heart. This is the most appropriate next step in management.

Pericardiocentesis (B) is a procedure that involves inserting a needle into the pericardial space to drain fluid, but it is not the best option in this scenario. IV heparin (A) is not indicated for cardiac tamponade. A chest CT scan (C) may be useful in diagnosing other injuries, but it is not the most urgent step in managing cardiac tamponade.

His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 136/88 mm Hg. Lung auscultation reveals a prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing. Spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 62%, an FEV1 of 60% of predicted, and a total lung capacity of 125% of predicted. The diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO) is decreased. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The patient's symptoms, physical examination, and spirometry results are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing on lung auscultation suggest airflow obstruction, which is supported by the spirometry results showing an FEV1:FVC ratio of 62% and an FEV1 of 60% of predicted. The decreased DLCO also suggests emphysema, which is a common component of COPD. The patient's 40-year history of smoking is a strong risk factor for COPD.

While the other options are possible, they are less likely based on the patient's symptoms and test results. Interstitial lung disease (A) would typically present with a restrictive pattern on spirometry, rather than an obstructive pattern. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (B) is often associated with exposure to specific antigens and would typically present with a more acute onset of symptoms. Bronchiectasis (D) would typically present with a history of recurrent respiratory infections and may have a more prominent cough. Bronchial asthma (E) would typically present with more episodic symptoms and may have a more variable FEV1.",Success

His APGAR scores are 7 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. His heart rate is 125/min, and his respirations are 45/min. All reflexes appear normal. There are no other visible defects. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. Wrap the intestines in a sterile bowel bag.

The infant has a congenital malformation known as gastroschisis, which is a defect in the abdominal wall that allows the intestines to protrude outside the abdomen. The priority is to protect the exposed intestines from drying out and infection. Wrapping the intestines in a sterile bowel bag is the most appropriate next step in management to prevent dehydration and infection. This will also help to reduce heat loss and promote a stable body temperature.

While the other options may be important, they are not the most immediate priority. Transferring the newborn to the NICU (B) and starting IV fluids (C) will likely be necessary, but they should be done after the intestines are protected.

The patient's laboratory findings suggest iron deficiency anemia, which is characterized by a low hemoglobin level, microcytic red blood cells (mean corpuscular volume 76 fL), and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The serum ferritin level is also elevated, which is consistent with chronic inflammation or rheumatoid arthritis.

Serum transferrin receptors are increased in iron deficiency anemia, as the body tries to increase iron uptake from the diet. This is a feature of this patient's anemia.

The other options are not correct:

B. Transferrin saturation is decreased in iron deficiency anemia, not increased.

Auscultation of his lungs reveals bilateral late expiratory wheezes.

What changes should be made to his current asthma treatment regimen?",C,"The correct answer is C. Add fluticasone daily.

The patient's symptoms, such as increased use of albuterol inhaler, nighttime awakenings, and difficulty keeping up with friends during play, indicate that his asthma is not well-controlled. The presence of bilateral late expiratory wheezes on auscultation also suggests ongoing airway inflammation.

According to asthma treatment guidelines, a step-up in therapy is indicated when a patient's symptoms are not well-controlled. In this case, adding a daily inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) such as fluticasone is the appropriate next step. ICS therapy helps to reduce airway inflammation and improve lung function.

Options A, B, and E are not correct because they do not address the underlying airway inflammation and do not provide adequate control of the patient's symptoms. Option D, adding salmeterol, may be considered in the future if the patient's symptoms are still not well-controlled after adding an ICS, but it is not the best initial step-up in therapy.",Success

Which of the following statements best describes the pathogenesis of this patient’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. The drug caused uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation.

The patient's symptoms, including fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, and sweating, are consistent with a condition known as thyrotoxic crisis or thyroid storm. The presence of bilateral cataracts and a gradual decrease in vision over the past 3 months suggests that the patient has underlying hypothyroidism.

The patient's symptoms are likely caused by the fat-burning pills, which contain thyroxine (T4) or triiodothyronine (T3), thyroid hormones that can stimulate the body's metabolic rate. The sudden increase in thyroid hormone levels can cause uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation, leading to an increase in heat production and oxygen consumption. This can result in the symptoms observed in the patient, including fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia.

Laboratory studies show a prothrombin time of 12 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 35 seconds, and a bleeding time of 11 minutes. Arthrocentesis of the right knee shows bloody synovial fluid. The patient’s condition is most likely associated with a defect in a reaction that occurs in which of the following cellular structures?",B,"The correct answer is B. Rough endoplasmic reticulum.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a bleeding disorder, specifically a coagulopathy. The presence of petechiae, bleeding gums, and bloody synovial fluid in the knee joint indicate a defect in blood clotting. The prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time are both prolonged, indicating a defect in the coagulation cascade.

The rough endoplasmic reticulum is the site where proteins, including clotting factors, are synthesized and modified. A defect in the rough endoplasmic reticulum would lead to impaired synthesis or modification of clotting factors, resulting in a bleeding disorder.

A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician because she had unprotected intercourse with her boyfriend the previous day. She has had regular menses since menarche at the age of 12. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago. She has no history of serious illness but is allergic to certain jewelry and metal alloys. She takes no medications. A urine pregnancy test is negative. She does not wish to become pregnant until she finishes college in six months. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,C,"The correct answer is C. Administer ulipristal acetate.

The patient is seeking emergency contraception after unprotected intercourse. Ulipristal acetate is a selective progesterone receptor modulator that can be used as an emergency contraceptive up to 120 hours after unprotected intercourse. It is a good option for this patient because she is not pregnant (based on the negative urine pregnancy test) and does not want to become pregnant until she finishes college in six months.

Option A is not suitable because the patient has a metal allergy, and copper-containing intrauterine devices may not be appropriate.

Option B, mifepristone, is not typically used as an emergency contraceptive, but rather as an abortifacient.

Option D, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, is a hormonal contraceptive, but it is not typically used as an emergency contraceptive.

Option E, combined oral contraceptive, is not suitable as an emergency contraceptive, and it may not be effective in preventing pregnancy at this point.",Success
"A 27-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder presents for a 3-month follow-up after starting treatment with lithium. She says she has been compliant with her medication but has experienced no improvement. The patient has no other significant past medical history and takes no other medications. She reports no known allergies. The patient is afebrile, and her vital signs are within normal limits. A physical examination is unremarkable. The patient is switched to a different medication. The patient presents 2 weeks later with an acute onset rash on her torso consisting of targetoid lesions with a vesicular center. She says the rash developed 2 days ago which has progressively worsened. She also says that 1 week ago she developed fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days. Which of the following drugs was this patient most likely prescribed?",B,"The correct answer is B. Lamotrigine.

The patient's symptoms, including the targetoid lesions with a vesicular center, fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills, are consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), a rare but serious adverse reaction to certain medications. Lamotrigine is a known cause of SJS, and the timing of the patient's symptoms (2 weeks after starting the new medication) is consistent with this diagnosis.",Success
"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 6-month history of mild episodic abdominal pain. The episodes occur every 1–2 months and last for a few hours. The pain is located in the epigastrium, radiates to his back, and is occasionally associated with mild nausea. His mother is concerned that his condition might be hereditary because his older sister was diagnosed with congenital heart disease. He is otherwise healthy and has met all developmental milestones. He is at the 75th percentile for height and the 65th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows no abdominal distention, guarding, or rebound tenderness. Which of the following congenital conditions would best explain this patient's symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is E. Pancreas divisum.

The symptoms described, such as episodic abdominal pain in the epigastrium that radiates to the back, are consistent with pancreatitis. Pancreas divisum is a congenital anomaly where the pancreas fails to fuse properly, resulting in two separate ducts that drain into the duodenum. This can cause recurrent pancreatitis, which matches the patient's symptoms.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms:

A. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis typically presents in infancy with projectile vomiting and is not associated with episodic abdominal pain.

B. Biliary cysts are typically associated with jaundice and right upper quadrant pain, not epigastric pain.

C. Tracheoesophageal fistula is a congenital anomaly that affects the esophagus and trachea, not the pancreas, and would not cause the described symptoms.

D. Intestinal malrotation can cause abdominal pain, but it is typically associated with vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension, which are not present in this patient.",Success
"A healthy, full-term 1-day-old female is being evaluated after birth and is noted to have a cleft palate and a systolic ejection murmur at the second left intercostal space. A chest radiograph is obtained which reveals a boot-shaped heart and absence of a thymus. An echocardiogram is done which shows pulmonary stenosis with a hypertrophic right ventricular wall, ventricular septal defect, and overriding of the aorta. Which of the following additional features is expected to be seen in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Seizures due to hypocalcemia.

The patient's symptoms and echocardiogram results are consistent with DiGeorge syndrome, a congenital disorder caused by a deletion of chromosome 22q11.2. This syndrome is characterized by a combination of physical and developmental abnormalities, including:

* Cleft palate
* Congenital heart defects, such as tetralogy of Fallot (pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, and overriding of the aorta)
* Absence or hypoplasia of the thymus
* Hypocalcemia, which can cause seizures
* Developmental delays and intellectual disability

"A 58-year-old male with a history of obesity and hypertension presents to his primary care physician for a follow-up visit. He reports that he feels well and has no complaints. He currently takes hydrochlorothiazide. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 135/80 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 17/min. His BMI is 31 kg/m2. Results of a lipid panel are: Total cholesterol is 280 mg/dl, triglycerides are 110 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol is 40 mg/dl, and LDL cholesterol is 195 mg/dl. Her physician considers starting her on atorvastatin. Which of the following will most likely decrease after initiating this medication?",A,"The correct answer is C. HMG-CoA.

Atorvastatin is a statin medication that inhibits the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is involved in the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. By inhibiting this enzyme, atorvastatin decreases the production of cholesterol in the liver, leading to a decrease in LDL cholesterol levels.

HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) is an intermediate in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. With atorvastatin therapy, the levels of HMG-CoA will decrease as the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase is inhibited.

The other options are not directly affected by atorvastatin therapy:

A. Mevalonate is a precursor to cholesterol synthesis, but its levels will not decrease with atorvastatin therapy.

B. Acetoacetyl-CoA is an intermediate in the synthesis of ketone bodies, not directly related to cholesterol synthesis.

D. Diacylglycerol is a precursor to triglyceride synthesis, not directly related to cholesterol synthesis.

E. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels may actually increase with atorvastatin therapy, as statins can increase the expression of genes involved in HDL synthesis.",Success

A 60-year-old female patient with a history of hypertension presents to an outpatient office for regular check-up and is found to have hypertriglyceridemia. Her physician prescribes high-dose niacin and recommends taking the medication along with aspirin. The side effect the physician is trying to avoid is thought to be mediated by what mechanism?,C,"The correct answer is C. Release of prostaglandins.

Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is a medication used to treat high cholesterol and hypertriglyceridemia. One of its common side effects is skin flushing, which is caused by the release of prostaglandins, a type of hormone-like substance that dilates blood vessels and increases blood flow to the skin. To minimize this side effect, physicians often recommend taking aspirin with niacin, as aspirin can inhibit the production of prostaglandins.",Success

A liver biopsy is performed and shows mononuclear infiltrates that are limited to portal tracts and periportal hepatocyte necrosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",A,"The correct answer is A. Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir therapy.

The patient has been diagnosed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection, as evidenced by the positive HCV antibody and RNA tests. The liver biopsy shows characteristic features of chronic hepatitis C, including mononuclear infiltrates in portal tracts and periportal hepatocyte necrosis.

The most appropriate next step in management is to initiate antiviral therapy to treat the HCV infection. Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir are direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) that are specifically approved for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection. This combination therapy has been shown to be highly effective in achieving sustained virologic response (SVR) and curing the infection.

Option C, interferon and ribavirin therapy, is an older treatment regimen that is no longer recommended as first-line therapy for HCV genotype 1 infection due to its lower efficacy and higher side effect profile compared to DAA therapy.

Options B and D are not correct because tenofovir and velpatasvir are not approved for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 infection, and tenofovir and entecavir are antiviral medications used to treat HIV and hepatitis B virus infections, respectively.

Option E, scheduling a follow-up in 6 months, is not appropriate because the patient has a diagnosed HCV infection that requires prompt treatment to prevent further liver damage and complications.",Success
A 44-year-old woman with hypothyroidism comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of tingling in her feet and poor balance. Her only medication is levothyroxine. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor and an ataxic gait. Proprioception and sense of vibration are decreased in her toes bilaterally. Laboratory studies show macrocytic anemia and normal thyroid hormone levels. Histological evaluation of tissue samples obtained by esophagogastroduodenoscopy reveals atrophic changes of the gastric body and fundus with normal antral mucosa. Which of the following structures is most likely being targeted by antibodies in this patient?,C,"The correct answer is C. Parietal cells.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of parietal cells in the stomach. Parietal cells are responsible for producing intrinsic factor, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. The lack of intrinsic factor leads to a deficiency of vitamin B12, resulting in macrocytic anemia and neurological symptoms such as tingling in the feet and poor balance.

The histological evaluation of the gastric mucosa showing atrophic changes of the gastric body and fundus with normal antral mucosa is also consistent with pernicious anemia.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and diagnosis:

A. Islet cell cytoplasm is targeted in type 1 diabetes.

"A 26-year-old female complains of frequent, large volume urination. This negatively affects her sleep, as she has to frequently wake up at night to urinate. She also complains of increased thirst. Her past medical history is significant for bipolar disorder that is treated with lithium for 3 years. Serum osmolality is 425 mOsm/kg, and urine osmolality is 176 mOsm/kg. Which of the following best explains this patient’s serum and urine osmolality?",C,"The correct answer is C. ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts.

The patient's symptoms of frequent, large volume urination and increased thirst suggest a diagnosis of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). The serum osmolality of 425 mOsm/kg is slightly elevated, indicating dehydration, while the urine osmolality of 176 mOsm/kg is low, indicating that the kidneys are not concentrating the urine properly.

Lithium, which the patient has been taking for 3 years, is known to cause NDI by reducing the responsiveness of the renal collecting ducts to antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This leads to a decrease in water reabsorption and an increase in urine volume. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts, making option C the correct answer.",Success
"An 8-year-old girl presents to her pediatrician with intensely pruritic lesions over her buttocks, as shown. These lesions occur intermittently but have worsened over time.

K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 27 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is D. 5% dextrose IV with 0.45% saline IV.

The patient is experiencing high drainage output (>1 liter/day) from the pancreaticoduodenectomy, which suggests a pancreatic fistula. The patient's laboratory values indicate a hypochloremic, hyperbicarbonatemic metabolic alkalosis, which is consistent with a pancreatic fistula. The patient's dry skin and mucous membranes, along with the laboratory values, suggest that the patient is volume-depleted.

The best next step in management is to administer 5% dextrose IV with 0.45% saline IV to address the patient's volume depletion and electrolyte imbalance. This solution will help to replenish fluids, electrolytes, and glucose, while also helping to correct the metabolic alkalosis.

Option A (0.45% saline IV) may not provide enough glucose to address the patient's volume depletion and electrolyte imbalance. Option B (0.9% saline IV) may exacerbate the patient's metabolic alkalosis. Option C (5% dextrose IV) may not provide enough electrolytes to address the patient's electrolyte imbalance.

Which of the following is the most likely pathogen?",E,"The correct answer is E. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.

The patient's symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weakness, are consistent with a bacterial gastroenteritis. The fact that she developed symptoms after eating the in-flight meal and has a history of traveling to India, where enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is common, makes ETEC the most likely pathogen.

"A research group has created a novel screening test for a rare disorder. A robust clinical trial is performed in a group of 100 subjects comparing the new screening test against the gold standard. The results are given in the table below:
Screening test\gold standard Disease present Disease absent
Positive 45 15
Negative 5 35
Which of the following is most correct regarding the statistical power of this new screening test?",E,"The correct answer is E. If the sensitivity of this screening test were decreased, the statistical power would decrease.

Statistical power refers to the ability of a test to detect a true effect or difference. In this case, the power of the screening test is related to its ability to detect the rare disorder.

Sensitivity refers to the proportion of true positives (disease present and test positive) among all those who actually have the disease. In this case, the sensitivity is 45/(45+5) = 0.9.

The power of the test is not directly given in the options, but it is related to the sensitivity. If the sensitivity of the test were decreased, it would mean that the test is less able to detect the disease, which would decrease the power of the test.

The other options are incorrect:

A. The question is not comparing the power of the new screening test to the gold standard, but rather evaluating the power of the new screening test.

B. Repeating the study could potentially increase the precision of the estimates, but it would not affect the power of the test.

C. The power of the test is not 0.8, as it is not directly given in the table.

"A 25-year-old woman presents to her new family physician for a follow-up appointment. She previously presented with itching, as well as frequent and painful urination. A vaginal swab was taken and sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. Diplococci were seen on Gram stain and were grown on Thayer-Martin agar. When discussing her infection, the patient says that she uses safe sex practices. Her history is significant for meningitis and for infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The physician discusses that the reason behind these infections comes from a defect in the innate immune system. Which of the following best describes the component that is likely deficient in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is A. Acts as an important opsonin.

The patient's history of meningitis and infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as the current infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (indicated by the diplococci on Gram stain and growth on Thayer-Martin agar), suggests a deficiency in the complement system, specifically in the late complement components (C5-9). This is because the patient has had recurrent infections with encapsulated bacteria, which are typically opsonized by the complement system.

The correct answer, option A, refers to the fact that the late complement components (C5-9) act as important opsonins, helping to mark pathogens for phagocytosis and elimination by the immune system. A deficiency in these components would impair the body's ability to clear encapsulated bacteria, leading to recurrent infections.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:

B. Bradykinin plays a role in angioedema, but this is not relevant to the patient's infections.

C. C1 esterase inhibitor is involved in the regulation of the classical complement pathway, but its degradation is not directly related to the patient's condition.

D. The formation of pores in the cell membrane is a function of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which is composed of the late complement components (C5-9). While this is related to the complement system, it is not the primary defect in this patient.

"A 55-year-old woman with papillary thyroid carcinoma underwent total thyroidectomy. She has no significant medical history. On postoperative day 1, she develops perioral numbness and a tingling sensation, along with paresthesia of the hands and feet. The physical examination reveals that she is anxious and confused. Her pulse is 90/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, the respirations are 22/min, and the temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F). Latent tetany (carpal spasm) is evident in the right arm. This is observed when the sphygmomanometer cuff pressure is raised above the systolic blood pressure and held for 3 minutes. The laboratory test results are as follows:
Serum calcium 6.7 mg/dL
Serum sodium 143 mEq/L
Serum potassium 4.4 mEq/L
Serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL
Blood urea 16 mg/dL
Serum magnesium 1.1 mEq/L
What is the most likely cause of this condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Inadvertent surgical removal of parathyroid glands.

The patient's symptoms, such as perioral numbness, tingling sensation, and paresthesia, are consistent with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels). The laboratory results show a low serum calcium level of 6.7 mg/dL, which supports this diagnosis. The presence of latent tetany (carpal spasm) also suggests hypocalcemia.

The most likely cause of hypocalcemia in this patient is inadvertent surgical removal of parathyroid glands during the total thyroidectomy. The parathyroid glands are located near the thyroid gland and can be accidentally removed or damaged during surgery, leading to hypoparathyroidism and subsequent hypocalcemia.

The other options are not supported by the patient's history and laboratory results. DiGeorge syndrome is a congenital disorder that affects the development of the parathyroid glands, but it is not a likely cause of hypocalcemia in a 55-year-old woman who has undergone thyroid surgery. Chronic hypomagnesemia can contribute to hypocalcemia, but the patient's serum magnesium level is within the normal range. Hungry bone syndrome is a condition that occurs after parathyroid surgery, but it is characterized by severe hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, which is not seen in this patient.",Success

The patient's symptoms, including painful enlarging bruises and skin ulceration, are consistent with warfarin-induced skin necrosis, a rare but serious complication of warfarin therapy. This condition is often seen in patients with protein C deficiency, which can be acquired or inherited. Warfarin can induce a rapid decrease in protein C levels, leading to a hypercoagulable state and skin necrosis.

Metoprolol is a beta blocker, which can decrease heart rate and contractility, and may worsen heart failure in the acute setting. In this patient, who is already hypotensive, metoprolol may further decrease blood pressure and worsen cardiac output.

The other options are all potentially useful in the management of heart failure:

* Furosemide (A) is a diuretic that can help reduce fluid overload and alleviate symptoms of heart failure.
* Nesiritide (B) is a B-type natriuretic peptide that can help reduce fluid overload and improve cardiac function.
* Digoxin (D) is a medication that can help improve cardiac contractility and reduce symptoms of heart failure.
* Dobutamine (E) is an inotrope that can help increase cardiac contractility and improve cardiac output.

Therefore, metoprolol is the correct answer.",Success
"A 49-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea and cough which she developed approx. 8 hours ago. 2 weeks ago she had a prophylactic ovariectomy because of a family history of ovarian cancer. She is known to have type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 1 hypertension, but she does not take her antihypertensives because she is not concerned about her blood pressure. Also, she has a history of opioid abuse. She takes metformin 1000 mg and aspirin 81 mg. She has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for 22 years. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 155/80 mm Hg, heart rate 101/min, respiratory rate 31/min, and temperature 37.9℃ (100.2℉). Blood saturation on room air is 89%. On examination, the patient is dyspneic and acrocyanotic. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral rales over the lower lobes. A cardiac examination is significant for S2 accentuation best heard in the second intercostal space at the left sternal border and S3 presence. There is no leg edema. Neurological examination is within normal limits. Arterial blood gases analysis shows the following results:
pH 7.49
PaO2 58 mm Hg
PaCO2 30 mm Hg
HCO3-  22 mEq/L
Based on the given data, which of the following could cause respiratory failure in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE), which is a common complication of recent surgery, particularly in patients with a history of cancer and immobility. The patient's tachypnea, dyspnea, and hypoxia are consistent with PE. The accentuation of the S2 heart sound and the presence of an S3 gallop suggest right ventricular strain, which is also consistent with PE.

The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.49, which is slightly alkalotic, and a PaO2 of 58 mm Hg, which is low. The PaCO2 is 30 mm Hg, which is slightly low, and the HCO3- is 22 mEq/L, which is normal. This suggests that the patient has a respiratory alkalosis, which is consistent with PE.

Option A, increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli, is the most likely cause of respiratory failure in this patient. Pulmonary embolism can cause a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion, leading to increased alveolar dead space and respiratory failure.

Option B, ischemia of the medullary respiratory center neurons, is unlikely to be the cause of respiratory failure in this patient, as there is no evidence of neurological dysfunction.

Option C, alveolar fibrosis, is not supported by the patient's symptoms or examination findings.

Option D, depression of the respiratory center via opioid receptors activation, is possible given the patient's history of opioid abuse, but it is less likely to be the primary cause of respiratory failure in this patient.

Option E, decreased V/Q due to bronchial obstruction, is not supported by the patient's symptoms or examination findings, and bronchial obstruction would not typically cause the patient's symptoms and blood gas abnormalities.",Success

Which of the following is the best explanation for this patient's laboratory findings?",E,"The correct answer is B. Immune response to streptococcal infection.

The patient's laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which is a complication of certain bacterial infections, including Streptococcus. The patient's history of impetigo, a skin infection caused by Streptococcus, one month prior to presentation, suggests that this may be the underlying cause of her current illness.

The laboratory findings that support this diagnosis include:

* Hemolytic anemia, evidenced by the low hemoglobin and hematocrit, and the presence of schistocytes on peripheral smear (not mentioned in the question, but likely present).
* Thrombocytopenia, evidenced by the low platelet count.
* Acute kidney injury, evidenced by the elevated creatinine and BUN.
* Positive urine protein, which is consistent with glomerular damage.

The other options are not supported by the patient's laboratory findings:

* A. Alcohol-induced liver injury would be expected to cause elevated liver enzymes, which are only mildly elevated in this patient.
* C. Intestinal IgA deficiency is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or laboratory findings.
* D. Myoglobin toxicity would be expected to cause a higher creatinine kinase level, which is not mentioned in the question.
* E. Protein deposition is a non-specific term that does not explain the patient's laboratory findings.",Success
A 45-year-old Caucasian male presents to a gastroenterologist complaining of heartburn and difficulty swallowing. He recalls that he has been told by his primary care physician that he suffers from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The gastroenterologist decides to perform an upper endoscopy with biopsy. Which of the following findings would be consistent with Barrett's esophagus?,C,"The correct answer is C. A small region of red, velvet-like mucosa in the lower esophagus.

Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which the normal squamous epithelium of the esophagus is replaced by columnar epithelium, which is typically found in the stomach and small intestine. This change is often seen in the lower esophagus and appears as a small region of red, velvet-like mucosa. This is a hallmark finding of Barrett's esophagus.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Paneth cells are typically found in the small intestine, not the esophagus.

B. Metaplasia in the upper esophagus is not a characteristic finding of Barrett's esophagus.

D. Esophageal varices are dilated veins in the esophagus, often seen in patients with portal hypertension, and are not related to Barrett's esophagus.

E. Neutrophilic infiltration is a sign of inflammation, which may be seen in GERD, but it is not a specific finding of Barrett's esophagus.",Success
"A 16-year-old female patient with a history of mental retardation presents to your clinic with her mother. The mother states that she wants her daughter to have a bilateral tubal ligation after she recently discovered her looking at pornographic materials. She states that her daughter is not capable of understanding the repercussions of sexual intercourse, and that she does not want her to be burdened with a child that she would not be able to raise. Upon discussions with the patient, it is clear that she is not able to understand that sexual intercourse can lead to pregnancy. What should your next step be?",C,"The correct answer is C. Refuse the procedure because it violates the ethical principle of autonomy.

As a healthcare provider, it is essential to prioritize the patient's autonomy and decision-making capacity. In this scenario, the patient is not capable of understanding the repercussions of sexual intercourse, including pregnancy, and therefore cannot provide informed consent for the procedure. Performing the surgery without the patient's informed consent would violate her autonomy and be unethical.

Additionally, sterilization of individuals with mental disabilities without their informed consent is a controversial and potentially discriminatory practice. It is essential to prioritize the patient's rights and dignity, rather than making decisions based on the mother's concerns or assumptions about the patient's capabilities.

Referring the patient to a psychiatrist to obtain informed consent (Option D) may not be sufficient, as the patient's lack of understanding about sexual intercourse and pregnancy suggests that she may not be able to provide informed consent. Waiting until the patient is 18 years old (Option B) is also not a viable solution, as the patient's capacity for informed consent is not solely dependent on her age. Option E is not relevant to the scenario, as the patient's likelihood of getting pregnant is not the primary concern.",Success
"A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of malaise. He returned from a research trip to Madagascar 2 weeks ago and has since developed a worsening fever with a maximum temperature of 102.2°F (39°C). He also reports some swelling around his neck and groin. He works as a zoologist and was in rural Madagascar studying a rare species of lemur. His past medical history is notable for hypertension and gout. He takes lisinopril and allopurinol. His temperature is 101.9°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 22/min. On exam, he has painful erythematous cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Black hemorrhagic eschars are noted on his fingertips bilaterally. The pathogen responsible for this patient’s condition produces a virulence factor that has which of the following functions?",C,"The correct answer is C. Inhibit phagocytosis.

The patient's symptoms, including fever, lymphadenopathy, and black hemorrhagic eschars on his fingertips, are consistent with plague, which is caused by Yersinia pestis. Y. pestis produces a virulence factor called Yersinia outer protein (Yop), which inhibits phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils, allowing the bacteria to evade the host's immune response.",Success
"A 45-year-old African-American male presents to the family medicine physician to assess the status of his diabetes. After reviewing the laboratory tests, the physician decides to write the patient a prescription for miglitol and states that it must be taken with the first bite of the meal. Which of the following bonds will no longer be cleaved when the patient takes miglitol?",B,"The correct answer is B. Glycosidic bonds.

Miglitol is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, which means it inhibits the enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates (such as starches and sugars) into simple sugars. Specifically, it inhibits the cleavage of glycosidic bonds, which are the bonds between sugar molecules. By taking miglitol with the first bite of a meal, the patient is reducing the amount of glucose absorbed from the meal, which can help to control blood sugar levels.",Success
"A previously healthy 24-year-old man comes to the physician 1 day after the onset of burning pain, swelling, and multiple blisters over the left index finger.

In addition to supportive therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. Oral acyclovir.

The patient's symptoms, such as burning pain, swelling, and multiple blisters on the left index finger, are consistent with a diagnosis of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The patient's history of being sexually active and not using condoms suggests that the infection may have been acquired through sexual contact. The most appropriate next step in management would be to start the patient on oral acyclovir, an antiviral medication that is effective against HSV.",Success
"A 63-year-old man presents to the ambulatory medical clinic with symptoms of dysphagia and ‘heartburn’, which he states have become more troublesome over the past year. His past medical history is significant for hypertension and GERD. He takes lisinopril for hypertension and has failed multiple different therapies for his GERD. On physical exam, he is somewhat tender to palpation over his upper abdomen. Barium swallow demonstrates a subdiaphragmatic gastroesophageal junction, with herniation of the gastric fundus into the left hemithorax. Given the following options, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient’s underlying condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Surgical gastropexy.

The patient's symptoms and barium swallow results suggest a large hiatal hernia, which is a type of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The patient has already failed multiple therapies for GERD, including antacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) like omeprazole. In this case, surgical intervention is likely necessary to repair the hernia and alleviate the patient's symptoms.

Surgical gastropexy, which involves fixing the stomach in its normal position below the diaphragm, is a common procedure for repairing large hiatal hernias. This option is more likely to provide a definitive solution to the patient's symptoms than continuing with medical therapy or lifestyle modifications.

Lifestyle modifications (A) and combined antacid therapy (B) may be helpful in managing GERD symptoms, but they are unlikely to address the underlying anatomical issue of the hiatal hernia. Continuing on cimetidine (C) or omeprazole (D) may also provide some symptom relief, but they are not likely to be effective in the long term, especially given the patient's history of failed medical therapy.",Success
"A 63-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic instability. Several days prior, he had been swimming in the Gulf coast when he stepped on a sharp rock and cut his right foot. Three days ago, the patient presented to the emergency room after noticing painful redness spreading along his skin up from his right foot and was subsequently admitted for antibiotic treatment. Currently, his temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 84/46 mmHg with a mean arterial pressure of 59 mmHg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 14/min. His telemetry shows sinus tachycardia. His blood cultures are pending, but Gram stain demonstrated gram-negative bacilli. Which of the following best describes the form of shock and the skin exam?",B,"The correct answer is B. Distributive shock with warm skin.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with distributive shock, which is a type of shock characterized by vasodilation and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. This leads to a decrease in blood pressure, despite an increase in cardiac output. The patient's warm skin is a hallmark of distributive shock, as the vasodilation causes blood to flow to the periphery, resulting in warm and flushed skin.

The patient's history of a cut on his foot, followed by the development of painful redness spreading up his leg, suggests an infection, which is supported by the presence of gram-negative bacilli on Gram stain. The patient's hemodynamic instability, including hypotension and tachycardia, is consistent with septic shock, a type of distributive shock caused by an overwhelming infection.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Cardiogenic shock is characterized by a decrease in cardiac output, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

C. Hypovolemic shock is characterized by a decrease in blood volume, which is not consistent with the patient's warm skin.

D. Neurogenic shock is a rare type of shock caused by spinal cord injury, which is not consistent with the patient's history or physical examination.

Two days ago she experienced extreme pain in her face that was exacerbated with brushing her teeth and plucking out facial hairs. The patient has no relevant past medical history, however, the patient admits to being sexually abused by her boyfriend for the past year. Her current medications include ibuprofen for menstrual cramps. On physical exam it is noted that leftward gaze results in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward. The patient's initial workup is started in the emergency department. Her vital signs are within normal limits and you note a pale and frightened young lady awaiting further care. Which of the following is the best initial test for this patient's chief complaint?",B,"The correct answer is D. Post void residual volumes.

The patient's chief complaint is an inability to urinate, which suggests a possible urinary retention issue. Post void residual (PVR) volumes are a non-invasive test that measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination. This test can help diagnose urinary retention and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms.

While the patient's history and physical exam findings suggest a possible neurological disorder, such as multiple sclerosis, the initial focus should be on addressing the patient's acute symptom of urinary retention. The other options, such as head CT, head MRI, and lumbar puncture, may be relevant for evaluating the patient's neurological symptoms, but they are not the best initial test for her chief complaint.

Domestic abuse screening and exploring patient's life stressors (option E) is an important aspect of the patient's care, but it is not directly related to the patient's chief complaint of urinary retention.",Success

A 3-year-old male is brought in to his pediatrician by his mother because she is concerned that he is not growing appropriately. Physical examination is notable for frontal bossing and shortened upper and lower extremities. His axial skeleton appears normal. He is at the 7th percentile for height and 95th percentile for head circumference. He demonstrates normal intelligence and is able to speak in three-word sentences. He first sat up without support at twelve months and started walking at 24 months. Genetic analysis reveals an activating mutation in a growth factor receptor. Which of the following physiologic processes is most likely disrupted in this patient’s condition?,C,"The correct answer is C. Endochondral ossification.

The patient's symptoms, including shortened limbs, frontal bossing, and normal axial skeleton, are consistent with achondroplasia, a genetic disorder that affects bone growth. The presence of an activating mutation in a growth factor receptor, specifically the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), confirms the diagnosis.

Achondroplasia is characterized by a disruption in endochondral ossification, which is the process by which cartilage is replaced by bone tissue. This leads to abnormal bone growth and development, resulting in the characteristic short-limbed dwarfism seen in this condition.

Intramembranous ossification (A) is a process that occurs in the formation of flat bones, such as those in the skull, and is not directly related to the patient's symptoms. Osteoblast maturation (B) is important for bone formation, but it is not the primary process disrupted in achondroplasia.

Genetic analysis of this patient's cancer cells is most likely to show overexpression of which of the following genes?",A,"The correct answer is A. HER2.

Invasive ductal carcinoma is a type of breast cancer, and HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2) is a gene that is commonly overexpressed in breast cancer cells. HER2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a role in cell growth and differentiation, and its overexpression is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis.

TP53 (Option B) is a tumor suppressor gene that is often mutated in many types of cancer, including breast cancer, but it is not typically overexpressed.

BCR-ABL (Option C) is a fusion gene that is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia, not breast cancer.

BRCA-2 (Option D) is a tumor suppressor gene that is associated with inherited breast and ovarian cancer, but it is not typically overexpressed in breast cancer cells.

Medical history is notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both managed medically. He was last seen for follow-up of these conditions 1 month ago. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the cellular target of the medicine that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the membranes of epithelial cells in the distal convoluted tubule.

The patient's symptoms of constipation, fatigue, and decreased interest in activities suggest hypokalemia (low potassium levels) as a possible cause. The patient's medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and the fact that he was seen for follow-up 1 month ago, suggest that his medications may be contributing to his symptoms.

The most likely culprit is a thiazide diuretic, which is commonly used to treat hypertension. Thiazide diuretics work by inhibiting the Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, leading to increased sodium and water excretion in the urine. However, they can also cause potassium depletion, leading to hypokalemia and symptoms such as constipation, fatigue, and muscle weakness.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms:

A. Angiotensin-II receptors are targeted by angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which are used to treat hypertension, but are not typically associated with hypokalemia.

B. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is targeted by ACE inhibitors, which are used to treat hypertension and heart failure, but are not typically associated with hypokalemia.

C. Calcium channels are targeted by calcium channel blockers, which are used to treat hypertension and angina, but are not typically associated with hypokalemia.

A KOH preparation from the skin scraping confirms the presence of hyphae. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is C. Topical clobetasol.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of tinea corporis, a fungal infection of the skin. The presence of hyphae on the KOH preparation confirms this diagnosis. Topical clobetasol, a corticosteroid, is often used to reduce inflammation and itching associated with fungal infections like tinea corporis.

This is a classic example of projection, a defense mechanism in which an individual attributes their own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or impulses to someone else. In this case, the patient is likely struggling with his own substance abuse issues (alcohol) and is projecting those feelings onto his ex-boss.",Success
"A 65-year-old woman presents to a physician with painful ankles for 2 days. Her symptoms began 1 week ago with a severe fever (40℃ (104℉)) for 3 days. When the fever subsided, she developed a maculopapular rash over the trunk and extremities with painful wrists and fingers. She also reports abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Last week she returned from a trip to Africa where she spent several weeks, mostly in rural areas. Her temperature is 37.5℃ (99.5℉); pulse is 75/min; respiratory rate is 13/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. A maculopapular rash is observed over the trunk and limbs. Both ankles are swollen and painful to active and passive motion. The abdomen is soft without organomegaly. Laboratory studies show the following:
Laboratory test
Hemoglobin 11.4 g/d
Mean corpuscular volume 90 µm3
Leukocyte count 4,500/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 70%
Lymphocytes 15%
Platelet count 250,000/mm3
Ring-form trophozoites are absent on the peripheral blood smear. Which of the following organisms is the most likely cause of this patient’s illness?",B,"The correct answer is B. Chikungunya virus.

The patient's symptoms, including the severe fever, maculopapular rash, and painful joints (especially the ankles), are consistent with Chikungunya virus infection. The patient's travel history to rural Africa, where Chikungunya is endemic, also supports this diagnosis. The laboratory results, including the normal platelet count and absence of ring-form trophozoites on the peripheral blood smear, rule out other possibilities such as Dengue fever and Babesiosis. Leishmania major is typically associated with cutaneous lesions, and Tropheryma whipplei is associated with Whipple's disease, which is a rare gastrointestinal disorder.",Success
"A 61-year-old man complaining of unexplained bleeding by from the mouth is escorted to the emergency department by corrections officers. Upon examination patient states he feels nauseated as he begins to retch violently and vomit bright red blood. His past medical history is remarkable for cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse and untreated hepatitis C. His current blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate is 128/min, and oxygen saturation in room air is 88%. On further questioning, he states that he is scared to die and wants everything done to save his life. IV fluids are initiated and packed RBCs are ordered. You begin to review his labs and notice and he has elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate, ammonia, and lactate. What would be the appropriate response to the patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Accept the patient's wishes and ensure he receives appropriate care.

The patient has expressed a clear desire to receive treatment and wants everything done to save his life. As a healthcare provider, it is your duty to respect the patient's autonomy and provide appropriate care to address their life-threatening condition. The patient's past medical history and current condition suggest that they are at risk of bleeding to death, and prompt treatment is necessary.

There is no indication that the patient lacks decision-making capacity, and their request for treatment should be respected. Therefore, options A, B, C, and E are not appropriate responses.",Success
"Three days after undergoing a laparoscopic Whipple's procedure, a 43-year-old woman has swelling of her right leg. She does not have pain. She has nausea but has not vomited. She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 1 month ago. She has been using an incentive spirometer every 6 hours since recovering from her surgery. Prior to admission, her only medications were a multivitamin and an herbal weight-loss preparation. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg. Examination shows mild swelling of the right thigh to the ankle; there is no erythema or pitting edema. Homan's sign is negative. The abdomen is soft and shows diffuse tenderness to palpation. There are five abdominal laparoscopic incisions with no erythema or discharge. The lungs are clear to auscultation. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Compression ultrasonography.

The patient is presenting with swelling of the right leg, which is a common symptom of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The absence of pain and erythema makes DVT more likely than cellulitis. Compression ultrasonography is a non-invasive and sensitive test for diagnosing DVT. It is the most appropriate next step in management to evaluate the patient's symptoms.

CT pulmonary angiography (Option A) may be necessary if there is a concern for pulmonary embolism, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. Vancomycin therapy (Option C) is not indicated at this point, as there is no evidence of infection. D-dimer level (Option D) may be elevated in DVT, but it is not a specific test and can be elevated in other conditions. Two sets of blood cultures (Option E) are not necessary, as there is no evidence of sepsis or infection.",Success
"A 36-year-old man presents to a physician after having a transient loss of consciousness while resting after dinner the previous night. His symptoms only lasted for a few seconds and resolved spontaneously. This is the third time he experienced such an episode. He says that he recently started having nightmares. His father died of sudden cardiac death at the age of 45 years without a history of hypertension or any chronic cardiac disorder. A complete physical examination was normal. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevations in V1, V2, and V3, and the presence of incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB). After a complete diagnostic evaluation, Brugada syndrome was diagnosed. He has prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers. The drug also blocks potassium channels and prolongs action potential duration, but it does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. The drug also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity. If taken in high doses, which of the following are the most likely side effects of the drug?",A,"The correct answer is D. Pedal edema and flushing.

The drug being described is flecainide, a class I anti-arrhythmic medication that is used to treat Brugada syndrome. Flecainide has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity, which can cause side effects such as pedal edema (swelling of the feet and ankles) and flushing (redness and warmth of the skin).",Success
"A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for recurrent vomiting that began 5 hours ago. He describes the vomitus as bloody and containing black specks.

Physical examination shows decreased radial pulses, delayed capillary refill, multiple spider angiomata, and a distended abdomen. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. Which of the following is most likely decreased in this patient in response to his current condition compared to a healthy adult?",C,"The correct answer is A. Systemic vascular resistance.

The patient is presenting with signs of shock, including tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased peripheral perfusion (decreased radial pulses and delayed capillary refill). This is likely due to hypovolemia from vomiting and possible gastrointestinal bleeding. In response to hypovolemia, the body normally increases systemic vascular resistance (vasoconstriction) to try to maintain blood pressure. However, in this patient, the systemic vascular resistance is likely decreased due to the effects of chronic alcoholism, which can cause vasodilation and decreased vascular tone. This decreased systemic vascular resistance would exacerbate the hypotension and contribute to the patient's shock state.",Success
"A 69-year-old male with a longstanding history of hypertension and high cholesterol presents with abdominal pain and ‘bruising on his feet’. The patient states that his symptoms started about a week ago and have steadily worsened. He describes the abdominal pain as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The cardiac exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Carotid bruit present on the right. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds present. A pulsatile abdominal mass is felt in the lower umbilical region. Patient’s feet have the following appearance seen in the picture. Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm). High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are initiated. Morphine sulfate and metoprolol are administered. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?
 ",E,"The correct answer is C. Elective endovascular repair.

The patient has a small, unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a diameter of 4.1 cm, which is below the typical threshold for surgical intervention (usually 5.5 cm). However, the patient is symptomatic, with abdominal pain and a pulsatile abdominal mass, which indicates that the aneurysm is growing and may be at risk of rupture.

Given the patient's symptoms and the presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass, elective endovascular repair is the best course of treatment. This approach is less invasive than open surgical repair and has been shown to be effective in managing small to moderate-sized AAAs.

Discharging the patient with clinical surveillance and ultrasound monitoring (options A and B) is not appropriate, as the patient is symptomatic and the aneurysm may continue to grow and rupture.

Emergency open surgical repair (option E) is not necessary, as the aneurysm is not ruptured and the patient is stable.

Elective open surgical repair (option D) may be considered, but endovascular repair is generally preferred for small to moderate-sized AAAs due to its less invasive nature and lower risk of complications.",Success
"A 38-year-old woman undergoes a partial thyroidectomy for an enlarged thyroid gland compressing the trachea. During surgery, a young surgeon ligates the inferior thyroid arteries as close to the poles as possible to prevent intraoperative hemorrhage. 2 weeks later, the patient presents to the outpatient clinic with hoarseness. What could be the most likely cause of her hoarseness?",B,"The correct answer is B. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.

The inferior thyroid arteries are located near the recurrent laryngeal nerves, which are responsible for controlling the vocal cords. Ligation of the inferior thyroid arteries too close to the poles of the thyroid gland can put the recurrent laryngeal nerves at risk of injury, leading to hoarseness.",Success
"A 17-year-old man presents to his family physician for an evaluation about the size of his penis.

The cardiopulmonary examination is normal; however, the patient has difficulty identifying coffee grounds by smell. Which of the following explains the pathophysiology underlying this patient’s disorder?",B,"The correct answer is B. Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with hypogonadism, specifically a lack of pubertal development (Tanner stage 1). The patient's anxiety about his penis size and his difficulty identifying coffee grounds by smell (anosmia) are also indicative of Kallmann syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by isolated GnRH deficiency. This leads to hypogonadism and anosmia due to the absence of GnRH, which is necessary for the production of sex hormones and the development of the olfactory system.",Success
"A 63-year-old man is aiming to improve his health by eating a well balanced diet, walking daily, and quitting smoking following a 45-year smoking history. While on his daily walks he notices a strong cramping pain in his calves that consistently appears after a mile of walking. He sees his physician and a diagnosis of peripheral artery disease with intermittent claudication is made. To improve his symptoms, cilostazol is prescribed. What is the mechanism of action of this medication?",E,"The correct answer is E. Phosphodiesterase inhibitor.

Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, specifically a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor. It works by increasing the levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in platelets and blood vessels, which leads to inhibition of platelet aggregation and vasodilation. This results in improved blood flow to the affected areas, such as the legs, and relief from symptoms of intermittent claudication.",Success

Which of the following is characteristic of the most likely organism responsible for this patient's symptoms?",C,"The correct answer is B. Cultured on charcoal and yeast.

The patient's symptoms and chest radiograph are consistent with Legionnaires' disease, which is caused by Legionella pneumophila. Legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative bacterium that requires charcoal and yeast extract to grow in culture, hence option B is the correct answer.

Option A refers to the characteristic appearance of Streptococcus pneumoniae on a Gram stain.

Option C refers to the capsule of Bacillus anthracis.

His clothes appear dirty. Small scars are visible in the decubitus region of both arms. The lung sounds are equal with bilateral crackles, and heart auscultation reveals a systolic murmur that radiates to the left axilla. Petechiae are seen on the hard palate and palms of his hands. A chest X-ray and blood cultures are ordered. What is the most likely organism causing his symptoms?",C,"The correct answer is C. Staphylococcus aureus.

The patient's symptoms, including fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain, are consistent with pneumonia. The presence of petechiae on the hard palate and palms of his hands suggests a bacterial infection, particularly endocarditis. The systolic murmur that radiates to the left axilla also supports this diagnosis.

The patient's history of smoking and drinking, as well as the small scars on his arms, suggest that he may be an intravenous drug user, which increases his risk of developing endocarditis. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of endocarditis, particularly in intravenous drug users.

While Streptococci viridans (Option A) and Enterococci (Option B) can also cause endocarditis, they are less likely to cause pneumonia and are not typically associated with petechiae. Aspergillus fumigatus (Option D) is a fungal pathogen that can cause pneumonia, but it is less likely to cause endocarditis and petechiae. Staphylococcus epidermidis (Option E) is a common skin commensal that can cause infections, but it is less likely to cause pneumonia and endocarditis.",Success

"A 62-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for vision changes. About 90 minutes ago she was on the couch watching television with her husband when she suddenly noticed that she couldn't see the screen normally. She also felt a little dizzy. She has never had anything like this happen before. Her general physical exam is unremarkable. Her neurologic exam is notable for loss of vision in the right visual field of both eyes with macular sparing, though extraocular movements are intact. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head shows no acute intracranial process. Angiography of the brain will most likely show a lesion in which of the following vessels?",D,"The correct answer is D. Posterior cerebral artery.

The patient's symptoms and exam findings are consistent with a posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stroke. The PCA supplies the visual cortex, and a lesion in this vessel can cause a homonymous hemianopia (loss of vision in the same side of the visual field in both eyes) with macular sparing, as seen in this patient. The PCA is also a common location for ischemic strokes, especially in older adults.

The other options are less likely:

A. Internal carotid artery: A lesion in the internal carotid artery would more likely cause a contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss, rather than a visual field defect.

B. Anterior cerebral artery: The anterior cerebral artery supplies the medial aspect of the frontal and parietal lobes, and a lesion in this vessel would more likely cause a contralateral hemiparesis and cognitive deficits.

C. Middle cerebral artery: The middle cerebral artery supplies the lateral aspect of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, and a lesion in this vessel would more likely cause a contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and language deficits.

E. Basilar artery: The basilar artery supplies the brainstem and cerebellum, and a lesion in this vessel would more likely cause a brainstem syndrome, such as a locked-in syndrome or a coma, rather than a visual field defect.",Success
"A three-day-old, full-term infant born by uncomplicated vaginal delivery is brought to a pediatrician by his mother, who notes that her son's skin appears yellow. She reports that the child cries several times per day, but sleeps 7-8 hours at night, uninterrupted. She has been breastfeeding the infant but feels the latch has been poor and is unsure how much milk he has been consuming but feels it is not enough. A lactation consult was called for the patient and it was noted that despite proper instruction the observed latch was still poor. When asked the mother stated that the baby is currently making stools 2 times per day. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's presentation?",B,"The correct answer is B. Breastfeeding jaundice.

The patient's presentation is consistent with breastfeeding jaundice, which is a common cause of jaundice in newborns. The mother's report of poor latch and uncertainty about milk consumption, along with the infant's infrequent stools (2 times per day), suggest that the baby may not be getting enough milk, leading to dehydration and increased bilirubin levels. Breastfeeding jaundice typically occurs in the first week of life and is more common in breastfed babies.

Physiologic hyperbilirubinemia (option E) is also a possibility, but it typically peaks around 5-7 days of life, and the infant's symptoms are more consistent with breastfeeding jaundice.

Breast milk jaundice (option A) is a different entity that occurs later in life, typically around 7-10 days, and is caused by a substance in breast milk that inhibits bilirubin conjugation.

Sepsis (option C) is unlikely given the infant's overall well-being and lack of other symptoms.

On examination, he is jaundiced, lethargic, is oriented to person and place but not date, and has moderate ascites. Neurological examination reveals asterixis, and his stool is guaiac-positive. Liver function test are shown below:
Total albumin 2 g/dL
Prothrombin time 9 seconds
Total bilirubin 5 mg/dL
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 100 U/L
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 220 U/L
Which of the following is a feature of this patient condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. It is a diagnosis of exclusion.

The patient's symptoms, such as black, tarry stools, jaundice, lethargy, asterixis, and guaiac-positive stool, suggest hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other potential causes of altered mental status, such as infection, electrolyte imbalance, or medication side effects, must be ruled out before making the diagnosis.

Option A is incorrect because hepatic encephalopathy carries a poor prognosis, especially if left untreated. Option B is incorrect because while ammonia levels may be elevated in hepatic encephalopathy, they are not a reliable diagnostic test. Option D is incorrect because while cirrhosis is a common underlying condition, hepatic encephalopathy can occur in patients without cirrhosis. Option E is incorrect because EEG typically shows diffuse slowing, not focal localizing abnormalities, in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.",Success
"A 20-year-old healthy man is running on a treadmill for the last 30 minutes. He is in good shape and exercises 3 times per week. He takes no medications and denies smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and illicit drug use. Prior to starting his run, his heart rate was 70/min, and the blood pressure was 114/74 mm Hg. Immediately after stopping his run, the heart rate is 130/min, and the blood pressure is 145/75 mm Hg. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the change in his heart rate and blood pressure?",D,"The correct answer is D. Sympathetic nervous system activation.

During exercise, the sympathetic nervous system is activated, which increases heart rate and blood pressure. This is a normal physiological response to physical activity. The sympathetic nervous system stimulates the heart to beat faster and stronger, increasing cardiac output, and also causes blood vessels to constrict, increasing peripheral resistance and blood pressure.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Baroreceptor reflex would actually decrease heart rate and blood pressure in response to increased blood pressure.

B. Increased activation of the vagal nuclei would decrease heart rate, not increase it.

C. Increased aldosterone production would affect electrolyte and water balance, but not directly affect heart rate and blood pressure.

E. Vasopressin release from the pituitary would increase blood pressure, but not heart rate, and is not directly related to exercise.",Success

Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory tests are unremarkable. Plain radiographs of the right hip joint are significant for displacement of the right femoral head inferoposterior off the femoral neck. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of treatment for this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Surgical pinning of the right hip.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), a condition in which the epiphysis (growth plate) of the femur slips out of place, causing the femoral head to move posteriorly and inferiorly. The plain radiographs of the right hip joint showing displacement of the right femoral head inferoposterior off the femoral neck support this diagnosis.

Surgical pinning of the right hip is the most appropriate course of treatment for this patient. This involves placing a screw or pin across the growth plate to stabilize the femoral head and prevent further slippage. This procedure is usually performed urgently to prevent further complications, such as avascular necrosis of the femoral head.

The other options are not appropriate:

A. Reassessing in 3 months would delay treatment and potentially lead to further complications.

B. Immobilizing the right knee with conservative treatment would not address the underlying condition and may not provide adequate stabilization of the femoral head.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?",A,"The correct answer is A. Leydig cell tumor.

The patient's symptoms, including bilateral gynecomastia and a testicular mass, suggest a hormonal imbalance. The presence of a non-tender mass in the left testis, which is not transilluminable, is consistent with a testicular tumor. Leydig cell tumors are a type of testicular tumor that can produce excess estrogen, leading to gynecomastia. The patient's history of testicular trauma is unlikely to be the cause of the gynecomastia, as trauma would not typically cause a hormonal imbalance. Obesity (option B) can cause gynecomastia, but it would not typically cause a testicular mass.

Nocturnal penile tumescence testing.

This patient presents with erectile dysfunction, which can have both physical and psychological causes. Before initiating treatment, it's essential to determine whether the problem is primarily psychological or organic. Nocturnal penile tumescence testing is a non-invasive, first-line diagnostic test that can help distinguish between psychological and organic erectile dysfunction. It measures the frequency and quality of erections that occur naturally during sleep. If the test shows normal nocturnal erections, it suggests that the problem is likely psychological, and psychotherapy (option A) may be a suitable next step. If the test shows abnormal or absent nocturnal erections, it suggests an organic cause, and further evaluation and treatment would be necessary.

The other options are not the most appropriate next step in management:

B. Penile prosthesis insertion is a surgical intervention that is typically considered only after other treatments have failed.

C. Intracavernous prostaglandin E1 injections are a treatment option for erectile dysfunction, but they should not be initiated without first evaluating the underlying cause of the problem.

The patient's symptoms, including a 10-day history of cough, worsening rhinorrhea, purulent mucus draining from the nares, and facial tenderness over the maxillary sinuses, are consistent with a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis. The patient's history of mild intermittent asthma and lack of response to albuterol inhaler suggest that the cough is not solely due to asthma.

Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid is a suitable choice for treating acute bacterial sinusitis in children, as it covers the common pathogens involved, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The addition of clavulanic acid helps to combat beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.

Option A, amoxicillin, may not be effective against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Option C, ampicillin-sulbactam, is not typically used in pediatric patients. Option D, clindamycin, is not a first-line choice for sinusitis and may not cover H. influenzae.

Which of the following medications, if administered for the next 2 weeks, is most likely to reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations over the next 6 months?",B,"The correct answer is B. Oral prednisone.

The patient is experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Oral corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are commonly used to treat acute exacerbations of COPD. Studies have shown that a short course of oral corticosteroids (e.g., 2 weeks) can reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations over the next 6 months.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Oral theophylline is a bronchodilator that can help relieve symptoms, but it is not typically used to reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations.

C. Supplemental oxygen is used to treat hypoxemia, but it does not reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations.

D. Montelukast is a leukotriene modifier used to treat asthma, not COPD.

E. Nebulized N-acetylcysteine is a mucolytic agent that can help loosen mucus, but it is not typically used to reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations.",Success
"A 22-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for abdominal pain. The patient has been trying to get pregnant and was successful recently, but now she is experiencing abdominal pain, contractions, and a bloody vaginal discharge. According to her last appointment with her primary care provider, she is 10 weeks pregnant. The patient has a past medical history of constipation, anxiety, and substance abuse. She is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a bloody vaginal discharge and an open cervix. The patient is initially extremely grateful for the care she is receiving and thanks the doctor and the nursing staff for saving her baby. Upon hearing the news that she is having a spontaneous abortion, the patient becomes angry and aggressive and states that her physician and the medical staff are incompetent, evil, and she is going to sue all of them. The patient is left to grieve but upon entering the room again you notice that the patient has new lacerations over her wrists and that some of the medical equipment in the room is broken. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Borderline personality disorder.

The patient's behavior, as described, is consistent with borderline personality disorder. The patient initially presents as grateful and cooperative, but then suddenly becomes angry, aggressive, and accusatory when faced with the news of her miscarriage. This intense emotional dysregulation and rapid shift in mood are characteristic of borderline personality disorder.

Additionally, the patient's self-harming behavior (lacerations on her wrists) and destructive behavior (breaking medical equipment) are also consistent with borderline personality disorder.

Acute stress response (A) is a possible diagnosis, but it would not typically involve self-harming behavior or destructive behavior towards others.

Antisocial personality disorder (B) is not supported by the patient's behavior, as it is characterized by a lack of empathy and impulsivity, but not necessarily by emotional dysregulation or self-harming behavior.

Normal grief response (D) is not a likely diagnosis, as the patient's behavior goes beyond what would be expected in a normal grief response.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (E) is not supported by the patient's behavior, as it typically involves symptoms related to a traumatic event, such as flashbacks or avoidance, which are not described in this scenario.",Success
"A 45-year-old female presents to the emergency department with gross hematuria and acute, colicky flank pain. She denies any previous episodes of hematuria. She reports taking high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin over several weeks due to persistent upper back pain. The patient’s blood pressure and temperature are normal, but she is found to have proteinuria. Physical examination is negative for palpable flank masses. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis:",D,"The correct answer is D. Papillary necrosis.

The patient's symptoms of gross hematuria and acute, colicky flank pain are consistent with a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). However, the additional information about the patient's history of taking high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin, as well as the presence of proteinuria, suggests that papillary necrosis is a more likely diagnosis.

Papillary necrosis is a condition in which the papillae of the kidneys become damaged, leading to necrosis and sloughing of the tissue. This can cause hematuria, flank pain, and proteinuria. The use of high doses of analgesics, such as acetaminophen and aspirin, is a known risk factor for papillary necrosis.

Diffuse cortical necrosis (A) is a rare condition that typically occurs in the setting of severe hypertension, sepsis, or obstetric complications. Chronic pyelonephritis (B) is a chronic infection of the kidneys that typically presents with more subtle symptoms and is not typically associated with acute flank pain and hematuria. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (C) is a genetic disorder that typically presents with bilateral flank masses and is not typically associated with acute hematuria and flank pain. Acute nephrolithiasis (E) is a possible diagnosis, but the presence of proteinuria and the patient's history of analgesic use make papillary necrosis a more likely diagnosis.",Success
"A 40-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of increased bilateral pain in his knees. The pain developed over time and now limits his mobility. He states that the pain is worse at the end of the day, though he does have some early-morning stiffness lasting about 20 minutes. He used to have some success with over-the-counter NSAIDs; however, they no longer help. The patient also has been taking metformin for the past 2 years and is severely obese, with a BMI of 41 kg/m2. Additionally, he states that he has felt increasingly tired during the day, often dozes off during work, and no longer feels refreshed when he wakes up in the morning. Upon examination, there is no tenderness on palpation or erythema; however, some crepitus is felt. He has no other complaints but has a family history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on his mother’s side. Which of the following factors is the underlying cause of the patient’s pain, as well as the rest of his complaints?",C,"The correct answer is C. Excess weight.

The patient's symptoms, including bilateral knee pain, stiffness, and crepitus, are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA), which is a degenerative joint disease. The patient's severe obesity (BMI of 41 kg/m2) is likely the underlying cause of his OA, as excess weight puts additional stress on the joints, particularly the weight-bearing joints such as the knees.

The patient's fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and lack of refreshment upon waking are also likely related to his obesity and sleep apnea, which is a common comorbidity of obesity.

There is no evidence to suggest an autoimmune disease (A) such as rheumatoid arthritis, as the patient does not have tenderness, erythema, or other signs of inflammation. There is also no indication of a medication side effect (B) or infection (D) causing the patient's symptoms. Occult malignancy (E) is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms, as there is no mention of other symptoms or signs that would suggest cancer.",Success
"A 40-year-old man comes to the physician because of shortness of breath, double vision, and fatigue for the past 4 weeks. He has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications.

"A 24-year-old man is brought in to the emergency department by his parents who found him in his room barely responsive and with slurring speech. The patients’ parents say that a bottle of oxycodone was found at his bedside and was missing 15 pills. On physical examination, the patient appears drowsy and lethargic and is minimally responsive to stimuli. His respiratory rate is 8/min and shallow, blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, and pulse is 60/min. On physical examination, miosis is present, and the pupils appear pinpoint. The patient is given a drug to improve his symptoms. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely administered?",A,"The correct answer is A. μ, κ, and δ receptor antagonist.

The patient is likely suffering from an opioid overdose, given the presence of oxycodone and the symptoms of drowsiness, lethargy, shallow breathing, and pinpoint pupils. The drug that was most likely administered to improve the patient's symptoms is naloxone, which is a μ, κ, and δ receptor antagonist. Naloxone works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, thereby reversing the effects of opioids and restoring normal breathing and consciousness.",Success
"A 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing shortness of breath and a non-productive cough for 2 months. She has been unable to perform her daily activities. She has had malaise and bilateral ankle pain during this period. She noticed her symptoms after returning from a vacation to Arizona. She is a research assistant at the university geology laboratory. She is originally from Nigeria and visits her family there twice a year; her last trip was 3 months ago. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 112/72 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is no palpable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Her left eye is notable for ciliary injection and photophobia. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count is within the reference range. An x-ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Sarcoidosis.

The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath, non-productive cough, malaise, and bilateral ankle pain, are consistent with sarcoidosis. The chest x-ray shows bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, which is a classic finding in sarcoidosis. The patient's eye symptoms, including ciliary injection and photophobia, suggest uveitis, which is a common extrapulmonary manifestation of sarcoidosis. The patient's travel history and occupation as a research assistant in a geology laboratory do not seem to be directly related to the diagnosis.",Success
"A 75-year-old man presents to his physician with a 1-year history of dysphagia for solids. His more recent complaints include dysphagia for liquids as well. The patient states that he has no difficulty initiating swallowing but occasionally food is stuck in his throat. He does not complain of pain while swallowing but has noticed minor unintentional weight loss. The patient has no history of speech-related pain or nasal regurgitation. His family history is unremarkable. During the examination, the patient appears ill, malnourished, and slightly pale. He is not jaundiced nor cyanotic. Physical examination is unremarkable. A swallowing study reveals a small outpouching in the posterior neck (see image). Which nerve is most likely involved in this patient’s symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. CN X.

The patient's symptoms, including dysphagia for solids and liquids, and the presence of a small outpouching in the posterior neck on the swallowing study, are consistent with a diagnosis of Zenker's diverticulum. This is a pouch-like structure that forms in the posterior pharyngeal wall, typically in the region of the cricopharyngeus muscle.

The cricopharyngeus muscle is innervated by the vagus nerve (CN X), which is responsible for swallowing and relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter. Dysfunction of the vagus nerve can lead to abnormal relaxation of the cricopharyngeus muscle, resulting in the formation of a Zenker's diverticulum.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms:

* CN VII (facial nerve) is involved in facial expressions and taste.
* CN IX (glossopharyngeal nerve) is involved in swallowing and sensation in the throat, but is not directly related to the formation of a Zenker's diverticulum.
* CN V (trigeminal nerve) is involved in facial sensation and motor functions.
* CN XII (hypoglossal nerve) is involved in tongue movement and is not related to swallowing or the formation of a Zenker's diverticulum.",Success
"A 48-year-old female presents with an enlargement of her anterior neck which made swallowing very difficult for 2 weeks now. She has had constipation for the past 6 weeks and overall fatigue. She also had heavy menstrual bleeding; and often feels extremely cold at home. On the other hand, she has well-controlled asthma and spring allergies. On examination, the thyroid is stony hard, tender and asymmetrically enlarged. There is also pain associated with swallowing. Laboratory studies show a serum T4 level of 4.4 μg/dL and a TSH level of 6.3 mU/L. A radionuclide thyroid scanning indicates that the nodule has low radioactive iodine uptake. Which of the following is the most likely pathology to be found in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Reidel thyroiditis.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of Reidel thyroiditis, a rare inflammatory condition of the thyroid gland. The key features that support this diagnosis are:

* Stony hard, tender, and asymmetrically enlarged thyroid gland
* Pain associated with swallowing
* Low radioactive iodine uptake on radionuclide thyroid scanning
* Elevated T4 level and normal TSH level, indicating thyroid hormone production is not suppressed
* Presence of systemic symptoms such as fatigue, constipation, and cold intolerance, which are consistent with hypothyroidism

Reidel thyroiditis is a chronic inflammatory condition that can cause thyroid hormone production to be impaired, leading to hypothyroidism. The other options are not as likely based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

* Anaplastic carcinoma (A) is a type of thyroid cancer, but it is not typically associated with a tender and asymmetrically enlarged thyroid gland.
* Medullary carcinoma (B) is a type of thyroid cancer that can cause thyroid hormone production to be impaired, but it is not typically associated with a stony hard thyroid gland.
* Granulomatous thyroiditis (C) is an inflammatory condition of the thyroid gland, but it is typically associated with a tender and enlarged thyroid gland, and the patient's laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.
* Silent thyroiditis (E) is a type of thyroiditis that can cause thyroid hormone production to be impaired, but it is not typically associated with a stony hard and tender thyroid gland.",Success
"A researcher is testing an unknown compound, X, and seeing the effect it has on renal function. When she applies compound X to the cells, she finds that the urinary concentration of sodium and the pH decreases while the urinary potassium increases. Which of the following correctly states:
1) the cells of the kidney this compound acts on and
2) the identity of compound X?",D,"The correct answer is D. Principal cells; aldosterone.

Here's why:

* The decrease in urinary sodium concentration suggests that the compound is increasing sodium reabsorption in the kidney.
* The decrease in urinary pH suggests that the compound is increasing hydrogen ion secretion, which is also consistent with increased sodium reabsorption.
* The increase in urinary potassium suggests that the compound is increasing potassium secretion, which is also consistent with increased sodium reabsorption.

Aldosterone is a hormone that acts on principal cells in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. It also stimulates hydrogen ion secretion, which helps to decrease urinary pH.

The other options do not fit the described effects:

* Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) would decrease sodium reabsorption, not increase it.
* Furosemide acts on the loop of Henle and would increase sodium excretion, not decrease it.
* Hydrochlorothiazide acts on the distal convoluted tubule, but it would increase sodium excretion, not decrease it.
* Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, so it would have the opposite effects of aldosterone.",Success
"A 5-year-old male is brought to the pediatrician with complaints of a painful mouth/gums, and vesicular lesions on the lips and buccal mucosa for the past 4 days.

Physical examination is significant for vesicular lesions noted on the tongue, gingiva, and lips, with some vesicles having ruptured and ulcerated, as well as palpable cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism in this patient's presentation?",D,"The correct answer is D. HSV-1.

The patient's symptoms, such as painful mouth and gums, vesicular lesions on the lips and buccal mucosa, and difficulty eating and drinking due to pain, are consistent with a diagnosis of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, which is typically caused by HSV-1. The presence of palpable cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy also supports this diagnosis. HSV-1 is a common cause of oral lesions in children, and primary herpetic gingivostomatitis is a common manifestation of primary HSV-1 infection in children.",Success
"A patient is unresponsive in the emergency department following a motor vehicle accident.

The patient's wife arrives and demands that ""everything"" be done to keep him alive because she ""can't go on living without him."" The patient's adult son is on his way to the hospital. If the patient arrests, which of the following should occur?",B,"The correct answer is B. Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate.

The patient's written advance directive clearly states their wish not to be resuscitated in the event of a cardiac arrest. This is a legally binding document that reflects the patient's autonomy and decision-making capacity. The wife's emotional appeal and the son's potential input are not sufficient to override the patient's explicit wishes.

He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 33 years. On arrival, his pulse is 136/min and irregular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Synchronized cardioversion.

The patient is presenting with retrosternal chest pain and an irregular pulse of 136/min, which suggests a cardiac arrhythmia. The ECG (not shown) likely shows atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response, given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Synchronized cardioversion is the most appropriate next step in management because it can help restore a normal heart rhythm and alleviate the patient's symptoms. Cardioversion is a procedure that uses electrical shock to restore a normal heart rhythm, and it is often used to treat atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Coronary angiogram is not indicated at this time, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a cardiac arrhythmia than an acute coronary syndrome.

B. Intravenous esmolol is a beta blocker that can be used to slow the heart rate, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management.

C. Intravenous amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication that can be used to treat atrial fibrillation, but it is not the most effective way to restore a normal heart rhythm in this situation.

E. Defibrillation is not indicated, as the patient is not in cardiac arrest. Defibrillation is used to treat ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, which is not the case here.",Success
"A 14-year-old boy presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and is found on ultrasound to have a gallstone. Based on clinical suspicion, a CBC, a Coombs test, and a bilirubin panel are obtained to determine the etiology of the gallstone.

To confirm the diagnosis, an osmotic fragility test is performed which shows increased fragility in hypotonic solution. In this patient, what findings would most likely be anticipated if a blood smear were obtained?",D,"The correct answer is D. Spherocytes.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with hereditary spherocytosis, a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal red blood cell membranes that lead to the production of spherocytes. Spherocytes are small, spherical red blood cells that are more prone to hemolysis.

The osmotic fragility test, which shows increased fragility in hypotonic solution, is a diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis. The presence of spherocytes on a blood smear would confirm the diagnosis.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Hypersegmented neutrophils are seen in myeloproliferative disorders, such as polycythemia vera.

B. Schistocytes are seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

"A 30-year-old woman presents to your office with decreased appetite, malaise, and fever. Serologic tests reveal positive Anti-HBsAg and Anti-HAV IgM antibodies. Which of the following is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation?",C,"The correct answer is C. Shellfish.

The patient's symptoms, such as decreased appetite, malaise, and fever, are consistent with an acute hepatitis infection. The presence of Anti-HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) antibodies suggests that the patient has been exposed to hepatitis B, but it is not the cause of her current symptoms. The presence of Anti-HAV IgM (hepatitis A virus immunoglobulin M) antibodies indicates that the patient has an acute hepatitis A infection.

Hepatitis A is commonly transmitted through the fecal-oral route, and consuming contaminated food or water is a common mode of transmission. Shellfish, in particular, can be a source of hepatitis A infection if they are harvested from contaminated waters. Therefore, option C, Shellfish, is the most likely cause of the patient's presentation.",Success

Her body mass index is within normal limits, she is in the 40th percentile for height, and she is agreeable and pleasant during the interview. Which of the following additional findings is likely present in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Hypokalemia.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a diagnosis of Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by a missing or partially deleted X chromosome. The patient's short stature, normal body mass index, and undeveloped breasts are consistent with this diagnosis. Turner syndrome is also associated with hypertension, which is present in this patient (BP 137/92).

Hypokalemia (low potassium levels) is a common finding in Turner syndrome due to the presence of hypertension and aldosterone excess.

Aromatase enzyme deficiency would cause virilization, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

"Current recommendations state that a single hemoglobin A1c value of greater than 6.5% is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. If this 6.5% cut-off is to be increased to 7.0%, which of the following would be true?",A,"The correct answer is A. Increase in false negative test results.

If the cut-off for diagnosing diabetes mellitus is increased from 6.5% to 7.0%, it means that some people who would have been diagnosed with diabetes at the lower cut-off will no longer be diagnosed at the higher cut-off. This will result in an increase in false negative test results, as some people who actually have diabetes will be misclassified as not having the disease.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

B. Increasing the cut-off will actually decrease the number of false positive test results, as fewer people will be misclassified as having diabetes.

C. The number of true negative test results will increase, as more people who do not have diabetes will be correctly classified.

Her past medical history is significant for asthma and eczema. She has no history of any serious illness and takes no medications. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormal findings. An endoscopic image of the esophagus is shown. Mucosal biopsy shows eosinophilic infiltration. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time?,E,"The correct answer is B. Budesonide.

The patient's symptoms and endoscopic image suggest eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a condition characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa. The symptoms of difficulty swallowing solid food, feeling of food getting stuck, and occasional heartburn are consistent with EoE. The mucosal biopsy showing eosinophilic infiltration confirms the diagnosis.

Budesonide is a topical corticosteroid that is commonly used to treat EoE. It helps to reduce inflammation and eosinophilic infiltration in the esophagus, relieving symptoms of dysphagia and improving esophageal function.

Amlodipine (A) is a calcium channel blocker used to treat hypertension, and is not indicated for EoE. Fluconazole (C) is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections, and is not relevant to this patient's condition. Nitroglycerin (D) is a vasodilator used to treat angina and heart failure, and is not indicated for EoE. Omeprazole (E) is a proton pump inhibitor used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but it is not the most appropriate treatment for EoE.

The symptoms described, such as rapid mental deterioration, sudden jerking movements, and gait disturbances, are consistent with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by the misfolding of prion proteins. The conversion of a protein from an alpha-helix to a beta-pleated form, which resists degradation, is a characteristic feature of prion diseases.",Success
"A 38-year-old woman presents with eye dryness and a foreign body sensation in the eyes. On physical examination, the oral cavity shows mucosal ulceration and atrophy. Biopsy of the lower lip shows marked lymphocytic infiltration of the minor salivary glands. Which of the following is most likely seen in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Anti-Sjögren's syndrome type B (SS-B) antibody.

The patient's symptoms of eye dryness and foreign body sensation, along with the physical examination findings of mucosal ulceration and atrophy in the oral cavity, are consistent with Sjögren's syndrome. The biopsy result of marked lymphocytic infiltration of the minor salivary glands further supports this diagnosis.

Anti-SS-B antibodies are a type of autoantibody that is commonly seen in patients with Sjögren's syndrome. They are directed against the SS-B antigen, which is a ribonucleoprotein complex involved in RNA processing.

The other options are not directly related to Sjögren's syndrome:

* Anti-centromere antibody is seen in limited systemic sclerosis (CREST syndrome)
* Anti-Jo-1 antibody is seen in polymyositis/dermatomyositis
* Anti-Scl-70 antibodies are seen in systemic sclerosis
* Anti-double stranded DNA (-ds)DNA antibody is seen in systemic lupus erythematosus",Success
A 62-year-old man with a history of chronic bronchitis comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of worsening shortness of breath and cough productive of thick sputum. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years but quit 5 years ago. Physical examination shows an increased anteroposterior chest diameter and coarse crackles in the lower lung fields bilaterally. Treatment with a drug that directly antagonizes the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways is begun. Which of the following drugs was most likely started?,D,"The correct answer is D. Tiotropium.

Tiotropium is an anticholinergic medication that directly antagonizes the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways, which makes it a good fit for the patient's symptoms. It is commonly used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is likely the diagnosis in this case given the patient's history of chronic bronchitis and smoking.",Success
"A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation of his sense of smell. Two days ago, his mother found that he had left the gas on in the kitchen, and he was unable to smell the odor of the gas. As a child, he was consistently in the 40th percentile for height; now he is in the 15th percentile. He had bilateral orchidopexy for cryptorchidism as an infant. The patient is unable to identify several common odors when presented with them. Physical examination shows sparse axillary and pubic hair and Tanner stage 1 genitals. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Impaired migration of GnRH neurons.

The patient's symptoms, including anosmia (loss of sense of smell), hypogonadism (undescended testes, sparse axillary and pubic hair, and Tanner stage 1 genitals), and short stature, are consistent with Kallmann syndrome. This is a genetic disorder caused by impaired migration of GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) neurons from the olfactory placode to the hypothalamus during fetal development. This leads to a deficiency of GnRH, resulting in hypogonadism and anosmia.",Success
"A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up vaccination 1 week after being bitten by a rodent while camping. She received appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis in the emergency department and has already received 2 doses of the rabies vaccine. The same physician has been managing the post-exposure care regimen. After the physician administers the third dose of the rabies vaccine, the patient asks him if he would like to join her for a movie and dinner. The physician is interested in going on a date with her. Which of the following is the most appropriate reaction for the physician to have to the patient's invitation?",A,"The correct answer is A. Inform the patient that romantic relationships with current patients are unethical.

As a physician, it is unethical to engage in a romantic relationship with a current patient, as it can compromise the patient's autonomy, create a power imbalance, and blur the boundaries of the professional relationship. The American Medical Association's Code of Medical Ethics states that physicians should not engage in romantic or sexual relationships with current patients.

In this scenario, the physician should politely decline the patient's invitation and explain that it would be inappropriate for them to engage in a romantic relationship while the patient is still under their care.",Success

The physician suspects that the patient is suffering from a chronic lung infection. Which of the following statements best describes the type of lung inflammation in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. It consists of a largely circumscribed granuloma with epithelioid cells with Langhans cells.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with tuberculosis (TB). The chest radiograph showing consolidation in the apical part of the right lung is also suggestive of TB. The type of lung inflammation in TB is characterized by a largely circumscribed granuloma with epithelioid cells, including Langhans cells, which are a type of multinucleated giant cell.",Success
"A 16-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath after prolonged exposure to cold air during a recent hike with his friends. He informs the physician that he is asthmatic, but does not use inhalers regularly because he does not like using medications. He is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol. On physical examination, the temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the pulse is 120/min, the blood pressure is 114/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 32/min. Auscultation of the chest reveals bilateral wheezing. The physician asks the nurse to administer nebulized albuterol; however, the boy declines nebulized albuterol because of a history of palpitations that he experienced previously. The physician then prescribes nebulized ipratropium bromide, which results in significant clinical improvement. Which of the following second messenger systems is affected by the drug that improved the boy's symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Phosphoinositol system.

Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic medication that works by blocking the action of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors in the airways. This leads to a decrease in the production of inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which are second messengers involved in the phosphoinositol system. By blocking this pathway, ipratropium bromide reduces the contraction of airway smooth muscle and increases airflow, leading to improvement in symptoms of bronchospasm.",Success

Examination of the smaller newborn shows a flattened nose and left-sided clubfoot. The hematocrit is 42% for the smaller newborn and 71% for the larger newborn. This pregnancy was most likely which of the following?",A,"The correct answer is A. Monochorionic-diamniotic monozygotic.

The clues that suggest this are:

* The twins are both female, which increases the likelihood of monozygosity (identical twins).
* The twins have different birth weights, which is consistent with monochorionic-diamniotic twins, where one twin may receive more blood flow and nutrients than the other.
* The smaller twin has a flattened nose and clubfoot, which may be related to compression or constraint in utero, consistent with monochorionic-diamniotic twins.
* The hematocrit values are significantly different between the two twins, with the larger twin having a much higher hematocrit. This is consistent with twin-to-twin transfusion, which can occur in monochorionic-diamniotic twins.

Monochorionic-diamniotic twins are identical twins that share a single placenta (monochorionic) but have separate amniotic sacs (diamniotic). This is the most likely diagnosis based on the information provided.",Success
"A 55-year-old woman is found to have an abnormal mass on routine mammography. The mass is biopsied and cytology results are diagnostic for invasive ductal adenocarcinoma that is estrogen receptor positive. The patient is started on chemotherapy and ultimately has the mass resected. She is taking tamoxifen and has regular outpatient follow up appointments to monitor for any recurrence of cancer. The patient has a past medical history of asthma, obesity, and a uterine leimyoma which was definitively treated last year. Her last menstrual period was at the age of 47. The patient's vital signs and exam are unremarkable. Which of the following is a potential complication that could occur in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is B. Endometrial cancer.

Tamoxifen, which is being taken by the patient, is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is commonly used to treat estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. However, it has a known side effect of increasing the risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women. This is because tamoxifen has estrogenic effects on the uterus, which can stimulate the growth of endometrial cells and increase the risk of cancer. Therefore, it is a potential complication that could occur in this patient.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman is brought to the physician because of agitation, confusion, and lethargy. She has also had progressive recurring headaches and visual impairment over the last month.

Osmolality 300 mOsmol/kg H2O
Urine osmolality 240 mOsm/kg H2O
Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's hypernatremia?""",D,"The correct answer is D. Decreased antidiuretic hormone secretion.

The patient's laboratory results show hypernatremia (serum sodium level of 148 mEq/L), which is inconsistent with the presence of seizures, headaches, and visual impairment. The patient's urine osmolality is also low (240 mOsm/kg H2O), indicating that the kidneys are not concentrating the urine properly.

The most likely explanation for this patient's hypernatremia is decreased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion. ADH, also known as vasopressin, is a hormone that regulates water reabsorption in the kidneys. When ADH levels are low, the kidneys do not reabsorb enough water, leading to increased urine output and hypernatremia.

The other options are not supported by the patient's laboratory results:

A. Increased water intake would lead to hyponatremia (low sodium levels), not hypernatremia.

B. Increased ADH secretion would lead to water retention and hyponatremia, not hypernatremia.

C. Increased adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) secretion would lead to increased cortisol levels, which can cause hypertension and hypokalemia (low potassium levels), but not hypernatremia.

E. Decreased ACTH secretion would lead to adrenal insufficiency, which can cause hyponatremia, not hypernatremia.",Success
"A 29-year-old woman presents to the physician with a blurred vision of her right eye for 2 days. She has pain around her right eye during eye movement. She takes no medications.

On physical examination, illumination of the left eye results in bilateral pupillary constriction while illumination of the right eye results in a mild bilateral pupillary dilation. Fundoscopic examination shows optic disk swelling in the right eye. The color vision test shows decreased perception in the right eye. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Specific additional history should be obtained regarding which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is D. Sensory loss.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with optic neuritis, which is an inflammatory condition that affects the optic nerve. Optic neuritis can be a symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), and sensory loss is a common symptom of MS. Therefore, it is important to ask the patient about any history of sensory loss, such as numbness or tingling in the face, arms, or legs, to assess the possibility of MS.",Success
"A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with complaints of cyclic vomiting for 3 days. The vomitus is watery and contains undigested food particles. She also complains of feeling tired and having the “sniffles”. She has not felt like eating or drinking since her symptoms started, and she has not taken any medications. Her concern now is that she immediately gets dizzy when she stands up. Vitals signs include: pulse 120/min, respiratory rate 9/min, and blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg. Her eyes are sunken, and her tongue appears dry. Which set of lab values would best correspond to this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is C. pH = 7.5, Pco2 = 34 mm Hg, HCO32- = 38 mEq/L.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest dehydration and metabolic alkalosis. The vomiting has led to a loss of hydrochloric acid and chloride ions, causing a metabolic alkalosis. The patient's dizziness upon standing and sunken eyes indicate dehydration.

The lab values in option C are consistent with metabolic alkalosis:

* pH = 7.5 indicates alkalosis
* Pco2 = 34 mm Hg is slightly elevated, indicating respiratory compensation for the metabolic alkalosis
* HCO32- = 38 mEq/L is elevated, indicating metabolic alkalosis

The other options do not match the patient's symptoms and physical examination:

* Option A has a high Pco2, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.
* Option B has a low pH, which indicates acidosis, not alkalosis.
* Option D has a high Pco2 and low HCO32-, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 120/85 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. On examination, he is a healthy-appearing male in no acute distress with fully developed reproductive organs. Notably, cardiac auscultation is silent in the left 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. This patient most likely has a mutation in which of the following classes of proteins?",D,"The correct answer is E. Anterograde cytoskeletal motor protein.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a diagnosis of Kartagener syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by situs inversus (reversal of the organs in the chest and abdomen), chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. The patient's history of cleft lip, recurrent upper respiratory infections, and severe pneumonia are consistent with this diagnosis.

Kartagener syndrome is caused by mutations in the DNAH5 or DNAI1 genes, which encode dynein proteins involved in ciliary function and structure. Dynein is an anterograde cytoskeletal motor protein that plays a crucial role in the movement of cilia and flagella. Mutations in these genes lead to impaired ciliary function, resulting in the characteristic symptoms of Kartagener syndrome, including infertility due to impaired sperm motility.",Success
"A 71-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension comes to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation. She has had multiple episodes of upper abdominal pain over the past year. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. Physical examination shows a distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness and high-pitched bowel sounds. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a dilated bowel, multiple air-fluid levels, and branching radiolucencies in the right infra-diaphragmatic region. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",B,"The correct answer is C. Obstruction of the common bile duct.

The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with gallstone ileus, which is a rare complication of cholelithiasis. The branching radiolucencies in the right infra-diaphragmatic region on the abdominal x-ray suggest the presence of air in the biliary tree, which is a hallmark of gallstone ileus. This occurs when a large gallstone obstructs the small intestine, typically at the ileocecal junction, causing bowel obstruction. The patient's history of recurrent upper abdominal pain and the presence of air in the biliary tree support this diagnosis.",Success
"A 36-year-old man undergoes open reduction and internal fixation of a left femur fracture sustained after a motor vehicle collision. Three days after the surgery, he develops fever and redness around the surgical site. His temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F). Physical examination shows purulent discharge from the wound with erythema of the surrounding skin. Wound culture of the purulent discharge shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Treatment with oral dicloxacillin is initiated. Four days later, the patient continues to have high-grade fever, pain, and purulent discharge. Which of the following characteristics of the infecting organism best explains the failure to improve with antibiotic therapy?",E,"The correct answer is C. Ability to cleave β-lactam rings.

The patient's symptoms are not improving despite treatment with oral dicloxacillin, which is a β-lactam antibiotic. The presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters in the wound culture suggests that the infecting organism is likely Staphylococcus aureus. The failure to improve with antibiotic therapy is likely due to the production of β-lactamase, an enzyme that breaks down β-lactam antibiotics, rendering them ineffective. This is a common mechanism of resistance in S. aureus.",Success

Nasopharyngoscopy shows mild adenoid hypertrophy. Pure tone audiometry shows a conductive hearing loss of 26 dB on the right side and 28 dB on the left side. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Tympanostomy tube insertion.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a conductive hearing loss due to middle ear effusion, likely caused by recurrent ear infections and Eustachian tube dysfunction. The retracted and immobile tympanic membranes on otoscopy and the pure tone audiometry results support this diagnosis. The mild adenoid hypertrophy may be contributing to the Eustachian tube dysfunction.

Tympanostomy tube insertion is the most appropriate next step in management to drain the middle ear effusion and improve hearing. This procedure involves inserting small tubes into the eardrum to allow air to enter the middle ear and drain fluid.

The other options are not directly addressing the underlying cause of the conductive hearing loss:

A. Nasal decongestant therapy may help with nasal congestion, but it will not address the middle ear effusion.

B. Adenoidectomy may be considered in the future if the adenoid hypertrophy is contributing to the Eustachian tube dysfunction, but it is not the primary treatment for the conductive hearing loss.

Endotracheal aspirate Gram stain shows gram-negative rods. Two large bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluids are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",D,"The correct answer is D. Cefepime and levofloxacin.

The patient is presenting with severe pneumonia, likely caused by a gram-negative rod, as seen on the endotracheal aspirate Gram stain. The patient's history of metastatic colon cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and recent chemotherapy make him immunocompromised and at risk for severe infections.

Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin that has good coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common pathogen in immunocompromised patients. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that also has good coverage against Pseudomonas and other gram-negative rods.

Option A, ceftriaxone and azithromycin, is a good combination for community-acquired pneumonia, but may not provide adequate coverage against Pseudomonas.

Option B, ertapenem, is a carbapenem that has good coverage against gram-negative rods, but may not be necessary in this case, and its use should be reserved for more severe infections or those caused by resistant pathogens.

Option C, colistin, is a polymyxin that is often used as a last resort for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections, but is not a first-line agent.

He can write his name and comprehend written instructions. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side. The tone is also slightly reduced on the right side with exaggerated reflexes. His gait is hemiparetic. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Vascular dementia.

The patient's history of multiple strokes (left basal ganglia hemorrhage 12 years ago and right middle cerebral artery infarction 4 years ago) and the recent worsening of symptoms suggest a vascular etiology for his dementia. The patient's physical examination findings, including hemiparesis, reduced tone, and exaggerated reflexes on the right side, are consistent with a vascular dementia. The patient's lack of insight into his condition and his ability to perform some daily activities, such as feeding and dressing himself, also support this diagnosis.

Alzheimer's disease (Option A) is less likely given the patient's history of strokes and the stepwise progression of his symptoms. Frontotemporal dementia (Option B) is also unlikely given the patient's lack of prominent behavioral changes and language deficits. Lewy body dementia (Option C) is possible, but the patient's history of strokes and the absence of prominent visual hallucinations make it less likely.

On questioning, she says that she misses her medications every other day. Which of the following responses by the physician is most appropriate?",A,"The correct answer is A. """"""Let's talk about what makes it difficult for you to take your medications.""""""

This response is most appropriate because it acknowledges the patient's non-adherence to her medication regimen and encourages her to open up about the challenges she is facing. By asking an open-ended question, the physician can gain a better understanding of the patient's situation and work with her to develop a plan to improve her adherence. This approach is more likely to be effective than simply lecturing or educating the patient, as it addresses the underlying issues and shows empathy and understanding.",Success
"A 67-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine medical check-up prior to a scheduled elective femoropopliteal bypass surgery of his left leg. He feels well but reports occasional episodes of weakness and numbness in his left hand. He has a history of peripheral arterial disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gout. The patient has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. He drinks 3 cans of beer daily. His current medications include aspirin, metformin, enalapril, simvastatin, and febuxostat. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 86/min, and blood pressure is 122/76 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Auscultation of the right side of the neck shows a bruit. There is a right-sided reducible inguinal hernia. Neurological examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, creatinine, and glucose are within the reference ranges. An electrocardiogram shows signs of mild left ventricular hypertrophy. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. Ultrasonography of the neck.

The patient's symptoms of occasional weakness and numbness in his left hand, along with the presence of a bruit on the right side of the neck, suggest possible carotid artery stenosis. Ultrasonography of the neck is a non-invasive and sensitive test to evaluate for carotid artery stenosis. It is the most appropriate next step in management to further investigate the patient's symptoms and bruit.

While echocardiography (option B) may be useful in evaluating cardiac function, it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or bruit. Warfarin therapy (option C) may be indicated if the patient has atrial fibrillation or a history of stroke, but it is not the next step in management. CT angiography of the head (option D) may be useful in evaluating for cerebral vasculature, but it is not as sensitive as ultrasonography for evaluating carotid artery stenosis. Digital subtraction angiography of the neck (option E) is an invasive test that may be used to further evaluate carotid artery stenosis, but it is not the initial test of choice.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider concerned that she may be pregnant. She has a history of regular menstruation every 4 weeks that lasts about 4 days with mild to moderate bleeding, but she missed her last period 2 weeks ago. A home pregnancy test was positive. She has a 6-year history of hyperthyroidism that is well-controlled with daily methimazole. She is currently asymptomatic and has no complaints or concerns. A blood specimen is taken and confirms the diagnosis. Additionally, her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is 2.0 μU/mL. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Discontinue methimazole, start propylthiouracil.

The patient is pregnant and has a history of hyperthyroidism that is well-controlled with methimazole. However, methimazole is not recommended during pregnancy due to its potential teratogenic effects. Propylthiouracil is the preferred antithyroid medication during pregnancy, as it is considered safer for the fetus. Therefore, the next best step is to discontinue methimazole and start propylthiouracil to manage the patient's hyperthyroidism during pregnancy.",Success
"A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with back pain. The patient states that he has gradually worsening back pain that seems to have worsened after moving furniture the other day. He also states that while he walks, he feels numbness and weakness in his legs. The only time the patient states his back pain is improved is when he is riding his bike or pushing a cart at the grocery store. The patient has a past medical history of osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. He drinks 3 alcoholic drinks every day and has a 44 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 157/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a non-tender spine with normal mobility in all 4 directions. Radiography of the spine and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Spinal stenosis.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the worsening back pain and numbness/weakness in the legs while walking, are consistent with spinal stenosis. The fact that his back pain improves when he is riding a bike or pushing a cart at the grocery store (i.e., when he is in a flexed position) is also a classic feature of spinal stenosis. This is because flexion of the spine can increase the diameter of the spinal canal, temporarily relieving pressure on the nerves and alleviating symptoms.

Compression fracture (A) is unlikely given the patient's lack of tenderness on physical exam and the gradual onset of symptoms. Herniated nucleus pulposus (B) is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a compressive lesion rather than a disc herniation. Musculoskeletal strain (C) is a possible diagnosis, but it does not fully explain the patient's symptoms, particularly the numbness and weakness in the legs. Vascular claudication (E) is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a neurological rather than a vascular etiology.",Success
"A 3-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of fever, cough, purulent nasal discharge.

Bowel sounds are increased. Stool microscopy shows pear-shaped multi-flagellated organisms. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following?",B,"The correct answer is D. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a diagnosis of immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass deficiency, which is a primary immunodeficiency disorder. The patient's recurrent sinopulmonary infections, diarrhea, and malabsorption are consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of Giardia lamblia (pear-shaped, multi-flagellated organisms) in the stool further supports this diagnosis.

Individuals with IgG subclass deficiency are at increased risk for developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a type of cancer that affects the immune system.",Success
"An 8-year-old boy who recently immigrated to the United States presents with a rash. Past medical history is significant for a recent sore throat which caused him to miss several days at school.

Cardiac exam is significant for a holosystolic murmur heard best over the apex of the heart. Which of the following histopathologic findings is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Granulomas with giant cells.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of rheumatic fever, which is a complication of group A streptococcal pharyngitis. The rash described, with pink rings on the torso and inner surfaces of the limbs, is consistent with erythema marginatum, a characteristic skin finding in rheumatic fever. The holosystolic murmur heard over the apex of the heart suggests cardiac involvement, which is a common complication of rheumatic fever.

Monoamine reuptake antagonist.

The symptoms described in the newborn, such as high-pitched crying, poor feeding, rhinorrhea, low-grade fever, hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response, are consistent with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS is a withdrawal syndrome that occurs in newborns exposed to certain substances in utero, particularly opioids and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

The mother's lack of prenatal care and the presence of NAS symptoms in the newborn suggest that the mother may have used an SSRI or another monoamine reuptake antagonist during pregnancy.",Success

"A 36-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 40 minutes after being involved in a shooting. He sustained a gunshot wound in an altercation outside of a bar. On arrival, he is oriented to person but not to place or time. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 116/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 79/42 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination shows multiple abrasions over the arms and thorax. There is a 1-cm (0.4-in) entry wound with minimal bleeding on the right side of the chest in the 6th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Abdominal examination shows diffuse mild tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. A focused assessment with sonography shows no obvious free fluid in the pericardium; assessment of the abdomen is equivocal. An x-ray of the chest shows mild opacification of the right lower lobe. Two large-bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. The patient is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is A. Chest tube insertion in the fifth intercostal space at the midaxillary line.

The patient has a gunshot wound to the chest, and the chest x-ray shows mild opacification of the right lower lobe, suggesting a possible hemothorax or pneumothorax. The patient is also hypotensive, which may be due to bleeding in the chest. The most appropriate next step is to insert a chest tube to drain any blood or air that may be accumulating in the pleural space. This can help to relieve tension and improve oxygenation and ventilation.",Success
"Mutations in the ATP2A1 gene results in loss of function of the calcium ATPase pump, which is in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes of skeletal muscle in humans. This mutation results in a rare disease characterized by muscle cramping and stiffening that is usually most severe after exercise or strenuous activity and is typically relieved after affected individuals rest for a few minutes. Which of the following is expected in individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation?",B,"The correct answer is A. Muscle relaxation time: decreased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased.

The ATP2A1 gene codes for the calcium ATPase pump, which is responsible for pumping calcium ions back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum after muscle contraction. A loss of function mutation in this gene would lead to an inability to remove calcium ions from the cytosol, resulting in an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration.

This increase in cytosolic calcium concentration would lead to muscle cramping and stiffening, as calcium ions play a crucial role in muscle contraction. The muscle relaxation time would be decreased, as the muscle would remain in a contracted state due to the high levels of calcium ions.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer.",Success
"A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with crushing chest pain (10/10 in severity), radiating to the left side of the neck and the left arm.

Aspirin, clopidogrel, sublingual nitroglycerin, and morphine are given immediately and the patient now rates the pain as 4–5 out of 10. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Percutaneous coronary intervention.

The patient is presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) based on the ECG findings and elevated troponins. The patient's symptoms and medical history also support this diagnosis. The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines recommend that patients with STEMI undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as soon as possible, ideally within 90 minutes of arrival at the hospital. PCI is the best next step in the management of this patient's condition.

Intravenous alteplase (option B) is not the best choice because it is a thrombolytic agent that is used to treat ischemic stroke, not ACS. Coronary artery bypass graft (option C) may be considered in some cases of ACS, but it is not the best initial step in this patient's management. Oral ramipril (option D) and oral eplerenone (option E) are medications that may be used in the management of heart failure or hypertension, but they are not the best next step in the management of this patient's ACS.",Success

A 28-year-old Caucasian woman presents to your office with recurrent abdominal cramping on her left side for 6 months. She additionally reports bloody diarrhea and tenesmus. You suspect ulcerative colitis. Which of the following findings would most strongly confirm your diagnosis?,E,"The correct answer is E. Continuous mucosal damage.

Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that primarily affects the mucosa of the colon. One of the hallmark features of ulcerative colitis is continuous mucosal damage, which means that the inflammation and ulceration of the mucosa are continuous and do not skip areas. This is in contrast to Crohn's disease, which is another type of IBD that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract and is characterized by skip lesions.

The other options are not consistent with ulcerative colitis:

A. Involvement of the terminal ileum is more characteristic of Crohn's disease.

B. No rectal involvement is unlikely in ulcerative colitis, as the rectum is typically involved in this condition.

C. Noncaseating granulomas are more characteristic of Crohn's disease.

D. Transmural inflammation is more characteristic of Crohn's disease, which can affect all layers of the bowel wall. Ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, is typically limited to the mucosa and submucosa.",Success

An x-ray of the chest shows bilateral interstitial infiltrates. Methenamine silver staining of bronchial lavage fluid shows disc-shaped cysts. A defect in which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?",B,"The correct answer is E. B-cell maturation.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) with a superimposed Pneumocystis jirovecii infection. The decreased serum IgA, IgE, and IgG titers indicate a defect in B-cell maturation, which is consistent with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). The presence of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, which is an opportunistic pathogen, further supports this diagnosis.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Actin filament assembly is involved in cell migration and shape, but it is not directly related to immunodeficiency or Pneumocystis jirovecii infection.

B. T-cell receptor signaling is important for T-cell activation, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a B-cell defect rather than a T-cell defect.

C. Thymus organogenesis is important for T-cell development, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a B-cell defect rather than a T-cell defect.

A subsequent flow cytometry test demonstrates CD20+ cells. What is the most likely finding you would expect in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Presence of smudge cells.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The presence of CD20+ cells on flow cytometry supports this diagnosis. CLL is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, characterized by the abnormal growth of lymphocytes.

Smudge cells are a characteristic feature of CLL, and are formed when the fragile lymphocytes are damaged during the process of making a blood smear. They appear as smudged or broken cells on the peripheral blood smear.

The other options are not directly related to CLL:

A. Low levels of erythropoietin would be more consistent with anemia of chronic disease or kidney disease.

B. Low levels of leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) are seen in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), not CLL.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke, likely due to an embolic event. The presence of a swollen, erythematous, and tender left lower leg suggests deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a common source of emboli. The patient's history of oral contraceptive use and recent long-distance travel increase her risk of DVT.

A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a common cardiac anomaly that can allow a clot from the venous system to pass through the heart and into the arterial circulation, causing a stroke.

The patient is immediately started on a bolus of intravenous (IV) 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl). Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",D,"The correct answer is C. Start IV insulin infusion.

The patient is presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, metabolic acidosis, and ketosis. The patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory results are consistent with DKA.

The next best step in management is to start an IV insulin infusion to help lower the blood glucose level and correct the metabolic acidosis. Insulin will help to reduce glucose production in the liver, increase glucose uptake in peripheral tissues, and inhibit ketone production.

Option A, infusing sodium bicarbonate, is not necessary at this time, as the patient's pH is not severely acidotic, and bicarbonate therapy is generally reserved for patients with a pH < 6.9.

Option B, switching to 0.45% NaCl, is not indicated, as the patient is still hypovolemic and requires continued fluid resuscitation with isotonic fluids.

Option D, replacing potassium intravenously, is important, but it should be done concurrently with insulin therapy, as insulin can drive potassium into cells and worsen hypokalemia.

Option E, starting IV 5% dextrose, is not indicated, as the patient's blood glucose level is already severely elevated.",Success
"A 38-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his father because of altered mental status. According to the father, the patient was unable to get out of bed that morning and has become increasingly confused over the past several hours. The father also noticed it was “pretty cold” in his son's apartment because all of the windows were left open overnight. He has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension for which he takes medication. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug. He appears lethargic. His rectal temperature is 32°C (89.6°F), pulse is 54/min, respirations are 8/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?",B,"The correct answer is D. Levothyroxine.

The patient's symptoms, including altered mental status, lethargy, hypothermia, bradycardia, and decreased deep tendon reflexes, are consistent with an overdose of levothyroxine (T4), which is used to treat hypothyroidism. The recent initiation of this medication 10 days prior to presentation supports this diagnosis. The patient's attempt to remove his clothing, despite being hypothermic, is also consistent with a thyrotoxic crisis, which can cause altered mental status and inappropriate behavior.

The other options are not likely causes of the patient's symptoms:

A. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor used to treat hypertension, and it is not typically associated with these symptoms.

B. Fluphenazine is an antipsychotic medication used to treat schizoaffective disorder, but it is not typically associated with hypothermia, bradycardia, or decreased deep tendon reflexes.

C. Tolbutamide is an oral hypoglycemic medication used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, but it is not typically associated with these symptoms.

A 36-year-old woman presents with increased tiredness and lethargy for the past 4 weeks. Investigations show her hemoglobin level to be 8.6 gm/dL and serum creatinine of 4.6 mg/dL. The serum is negative for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and positive for C3 nephritic factor. Urinalysis shows a 3+ proteinuria. The renal biopsy demonstrates hypercellular glomerulus with electron dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane. What is the most likely cause?,B,"The correct answer is B. Membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN).

The presence of hypercellular glomeruli with electron-dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane on renal biopsy, along with the presence of C3 nephritic factor, suggests a diagnosis of membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). MPGN is a type of glomerulonephritis characterized by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and proliferation of mesangial cells. The presence of C3 nephritic factor, which is an autoantibody that stabilizes the alternative complement pathway, is a characteristic feature of MPGN.

Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is a possibility, but the absence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and the presence of C3 nephritic factor make MPGN a more likely diagnosis. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a clinical syndrome characterized by rapid loss of renal function, but it is not a specific diagnosis. Minimal change disease is a type of glomerulonephritis characterized by minimal changes on light microscopy, but it is not consistent with the biopsy findings described. Membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) is characterized by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, but it is typically associated with subepithelial deposits, not electron-dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane.",Success

Physical examination shows an overweight male in acute distress with audible wheezes. Crackles are heard bilaterally and are loudest at the lung bases. Which of the following findings on cardiac auscultation will most likely be present in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. S3 gallop.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest heart failure, likely due to uncontrolled hypertension. A S3 gallop, also known as a ventricular gallop, is a low-pitched, rapid filling sound that occurs in early diastole, often heard in patients with heart failure. It is caused by rapid filling of the ventricle and is a common finding in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.

The other options are not directly related to heart failure or the patient's symptoms:

""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.
Source of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health""",D,"The correct answer is D. It reflects a smaller sample size.

The standard error is a measure of the variability of a sample statistic. A larger standard error indicates more variability in the sample, which can be due to a smaller sample size. In this case, the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group has a smaller sample size (202 participants) compared to the other two groups (388 and 395 participants, respectively). This smaller sample size is likely the reason for the larger standard errors in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group.",Success

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT, GPT) 2,674 U/L
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, GOT) 2,254 U/L
Which of the following cells in the patient's liver were most likely damaged first?""",E,"The correct answer is E. Centrilobular hepatocytes.

The patient's laboratory results show significantly elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which are enzymes found in hepatocytes. The elevation of these enzymes indicates liver damage. The pattern of injury, with AST > ALT, suggests ischemic or hypoxic injury to the liver.

Centrilobular hepatocytes are the cells most susceptible to ischemic injury due to their location in the centrilobular region of the liver, which is the area most distant from the hepatic artery and portal vein. This region is therefore most prone to hypoxia and ischemia.

In this patient, the likely cause of liver damage is hypoperfusion of the liver due to hypotension and shock from the severe gastrointestinal bleeding. The centrilobular hepatocytes were likely damaged first due to the ischemic injury.",Success
"A 32-year-old man is brought by ambulance to the emergency room after being involved in a head-on motor vehicle collision at high speed. The patient was found unconscious by the paramedics and regained consciousness briefly during the ambulance ride. Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient’s vitals show: pulse 110/min, respiratory rate 12/min, blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination reveals an unresponsive man with multiple bruises across the chest and along the upper arms with a laceration on the forehead. His is unresponsive to verbal commands and physical touch. His GCS is 6/15. The right pupil is fixed and dilated. An urgent noncontrast CT of the head is performed and shown in the image. The patient is prepared for emergency neurosurgery. Which of the following anesthesia medications would be the best option for this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Propofol.

The patient has a severe head injury with a fixed and dilated pupil, indicating increased intracranial pressure. The goal of anesthesia induction in this scenario is to minimize further increases in intracranial pressure while maintaining hemodynamic stability.

Propofol is the best option because it:

* Has a rapid onset and offset, allowing for quick control of the airway
* Reduces intracranial pressure by decreasing cerebral blood flow and metabolism
* Has a minimal effect on blood pressure, which is important in this patient with a potentially compromised cerebral perfusion pressure
* Does not cause significant histamine release, which can increase intracranial pressure

The other options are not ideal for this patient:

* Halothane (B) can increase intracranial pressure and is not commonly used in neuroanesthesia.
* Midazolam (C) is a benzodiazepine that can cause hypotension and is not suitable for rapid sequence induction.
* Nitrous oxide (D) can increase intracranial pressure and is not typically used in neuroanesthesia.
* Sevoflurane (E) is a volatile anesthetic that can increase intracranial pressure, especially at higher concentrations. While it can be used in neuroanesthesia, propofol is a better choice for this patient.",Success
"A 25-year-old female presents to urgent care with complaints of one day of burning and pain with urination, urgency, and frequency. She denies having a fever but has experienced intermittent chills.

Urinalysis shows positive leukocyte esterase and nitrites. The urine culture demonstrates gram-negative rods that form pink colonies on MacConkey agar. She is treated with an antibiotic and her symptoms quickly improve. The mechanism of the antibiotic she was most likely treated with is which of the following?",A,"The correct answer is A. Inhibits cell wall synthesis.

The patient's symptoms and urinalysis results suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by a gram-negative rod, which is likely E. coli. The fact that the urine culture demonstrates pink colonies on MacConkey agar further supports this diagnosis.

Given the patient's allergy to sulfa drugs, she was likely treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic, such as ampicillin or amoxicillin, which inhibits cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins and preventing the cross-linking of peptidoglycan chains. This mechanism of action is specific to beta-lactam antibiotics.",Success
"A 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation comes to the physician for shortness of breath with mild exertion, progressive weakness, and a dry cough that has persisted for 6 months.

Physical examination shows enlarged fingertips and markedly curved nails. A CT scan of the chest shows clustered air spaces and reticular opacities in the basal parts of the lung. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's dyspnea?",E,"The correct answer is E. Excess collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix of the lung.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as shortness of breath, clubbing (enlarged fingertips and curved nails), and CT scan results showing clustered air spaces and reticular opacities in the basal parts of the lung, are consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a condition characterized by excess collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix of the lung, leading to scarring and stiffening of the lung tissue, which impairs gas exchange and causes dyspnea.",Success
"A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his mother after being found lying unconscious next to a bottle of pills.

She says he still found it difficult to concentrate on his studies and did not participate in any social events in college. He didn’t have many friends and was often found sitting alone in his room. He has also threatened to take his life on several occasions, but she did not think he was serious. While recording his vital signs, the patient goes into a coma. His ECG shows a QT interval of 450 milliseconds. Which of the following medications did this patient most likely overdose on?",E,"The correct answer is D. Citalopram.

The patient's symptoms and the ECG finding of a prolonged QT interval of 450 milliseconds suggest an overdose of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant, specifically citalopram. Citalopram is known to cause QT prolongation, which can lead to torsades de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia. The patient's history of major depressive disorder and the mother's mention of a medication that resulted in only slight improvement in symptoms also support this diagnosis.

While the other options are also antidepressants, they are less likely to cause QT prolongation:

* Bupropion is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor that is not typically associated with QT prolongation.
* Sertraline is an SSRI, but it is less likely to cause QT prolongation compared to citalopram.
* Venlafaxine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that can cause QT prolongation, but it is less common than with citalopram.
* Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that can cause QT prolongation, but it is an older medication that is less commonly used today.",Success
"In a study to determine the risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age (age < 30 years), 30 young patients with the condition are recruited into the study group.

Based on the level of education, 2 groups are formed: low educational status and high educational status. A chi-square test is performed to test the significance of the relationship, and an odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9–9.7. What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?",A,"The correct answer is C. The association is not statistically significant, but low education is a risk factor.

The odds ratio of 2.1 suggests that there is a positive association between low educational status and the risk of MI, indicating that low education may be a risk factor. However, the confidence interval (0.9-9.7) includes 1, which means that the association is not statistically significant.

Which of the following is the most reasonable 1st step towards ruling out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. D-dimer.

The patient's symptoms and risk factors (long-haul truck driver, recent travel, smoking) suggest the possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE). In a low-risk patient, the most reasonable first step towards ruling out PE is to perform a D-dimer test. D-dimer is a sensitive but not specific test for PE, and a negative result can help rule out the diagnosis. If the D-dimer test is positive, further imaging studies such as CT pulmonary angiogram or V/Q scan may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",Success

The cells that are present in this patient's DIP joints and PIP joints are analyzed and compared. Which of the following is most likely to be true about this patient's findings?",C,"The correct answer is C. DIP has more neutrophils and fewer monocytes than PIP.

The patient's symptoms suggest that she has a laceration over her distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, which is causing an acute inflammatory response, characterized by redness, swelling, and pain. This acute response is likely to be mediated by neutrophils.

On the other hand, the patient's symptoms of pain in her proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints for several years, which is worse in the morning but improves over the day, suggest a chronic inflammatory condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis. This chronic inflammation is likely to be mediated by monocytes.

Physical exam is notable for pain and tenderness over the mandibular and temporal region that is worsened when the patient opens and closes their mouth. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Temporomandibular joint dysfunction.

The patient's symptoms, including a severe headache associated with chewing, pain and tenderness over the mandibular and temporal region, and worsening of symptoms with opening and closing the mouth, are consistent with temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction. TMJ dysfunction is a common condition that affects the joint that connects the jawbone to the skull, and it can cause pain and tenderness in the jaw, face, and temples.

Migraine headache (A) is unlikely given the lack of other typical migraine symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (B) is a life-threatening condition that typically presents with a sudden and severe headache, often accompanied by other symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and loss of consciousness.

His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm × 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/μL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?",E,"The correct answer is E. Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change.

The patient is experiencing a paradoxical reaction, also known as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is a common complication of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) co-infection. IRIS occurs when the immune system recovers and responds to the presence of TB antigens, leading to an inflammatory response.

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, cough, and lymphadenopathy, are consistent with IRIS. The increase in CD4+ T cell count and decrease in HIV RNA levels suggest that the ART is effective. The negative sputum smear and normal Mantoux test suggest that the TB is under control.

In this scenario, the most appropriate initial step is to continue both antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any changes. IRIS is usually self-limiting and resolves with continued treatment. Corticosteroids may be considered in severe cases, but they are not necessary in this scenario.",Success

The symptoms described, such as fever, malaise, and intense pain in the anterior neck, along with the physical examination findings of erythema, tenderness, and enlargement of the thyroid gland, are consistent with acute thyroiditis. The ultrasound finding of a unifocal perithyroidal hypoechoic space suggests an abscess or a fistula.

Pyriform sinus fistula is a congenital anomaly that can cause recurrent thyroiditis or abscesses in children. It is a tract that connects the pyriform sinus to the thyroid gland and can allow bacteria to enter the thyroid gland, leading to infection.

A. Postviral inflammatory process is a possible cause of thyroiditis, but it is not specific to this patient's condition.

C. Antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) is an antibody that can be seen in autoimmune thyroiditis, but it is not related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

D. Perithyroidal fibrosis is a condition that can cause thyroid gland enlargement, but it is not typically associated with pain, fever, and abscess formation.

E. Autoantibodies to the thyrotropin receptor (TRAb) are seen in Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune condition that causes hyperthyroidism, not thyroiditis or abscess formation.",Success
A 65-year-old previously healthy man presents to the primary care physician with the chief complaint of red colored urine over the past month. He states that he does not experience dysuria. On physical exam there is no costovertebral angle tenderness. With this presentation which is the most likely cause of this patient's hematuria?,A,"The correct answer is A. Bladder tumor.

The patient's symptoms of red-colored urine (hematuria) without dysuria (painful urination) or costovertebral angle tenderness (kidney pain) suggest a lower urinary tract source of bleeding, such as the bladder. Bladder tumors, particularly transitional cell carcinoma, are a common cause of painless hematuria in older adults.

Beeturia (C) is a benign condition that causes urine to turn red or pink after eating beets, but it is not a likely cause of persistent hematuria.

Renal cell carcinoma (B) can cause hematuria, but it is often accompanied by other symptoms such as flank pain, weight loss, and fatigue.

Urinary tract infection (D) typically causes dysuria, frequency, and urgency, which are not present in this patient.

Urethral injury (E) is unlikely to cause hematuria without other symptoms such as pain or difficulty urinating.",Success
"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother with confusion, abdominal pain, and vomiting for the previous day. The patient’s mother says he started complaining of pain in his abdomen after he got back from school yesterday and vomited 3 times during the night. This morning, he seemed confused so she rushed him to the ER. She has also noticed that he has been urinating frequently and drinking a lot of water recently, and he has lost 6 kg (13.2 lb) over the past 20 days. His vital signs include: blood pressure 100/50 mm Hg, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 27/min, and temperature 35.6°C (96.0°F). His BMI is 18 kg/m2. On physical examination, he is disoriented to time and place and is taking deep and labored breaths. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation in the abdomen with guarding. Laboratory tests are significant for a pH of 7.19 and a blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL. The doctor explains to his mother that her son has developed a life-threatening complication of a disease characterized by decreased levels of a hormone. Which of the following would you most likely expect to see in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes.

The patient is presenting with symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. The hormone that is deficient in diabetes mellitus is insulin. Insulin plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism, and its deficiency leads to decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes and other tissues. This results in hyperglycemia, which is evident in the patient's blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL.

The other options are not directly related to the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus or DKA:

B. Decreased activity of hormone-sensitive lipase would actually increase glucose uptake by adipocytes, as hormone-sensitive lipase breaks down triglycerides to release fatty acids and glycerol.

C. Decreased proteolysis would not be expected in DKA, as the body is breaking down protein to release amino acids for gluconeogenesis.

D. Increased lipoprotein lipase activity would increase glucose uptake by adipocytes, as lipoprotein lipase breaks down triglycerides in lipoproteins to release fatty acids and glycerol.

E. Decreased glucose uptake by brain cells is not a direct consequence of insulin deficiency, and the patient's confusion and disorientation are more likely due to the metabolic acidosis and electrolyte imbalance associated with DKA.",Success
"A 58-year-old woman presents to the emergency department because of worsening abdominal pain for the past 2 days. She reports nausea and vomiting and is unable to tolerate oral intake. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), the pulse is 92/min, the respirations are 18/min, and the blood pressure is 132/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows yellowish discoloration of her sclera. Her abdomen is tender in the right upper quadrant. There is no abdominal distention or organomegaly. The laboratory tests show the following results:
Hemoglobin 13 g/dL
Leukocyte count 16,000/mm3
Urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL
Creatinine 2 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase 432 U/L
Alanine aminotransferase 196 U/L
Aspartate transaminase 207 U/L
Bilirubin  
Total 3.8 mg/dL
Direct 2.7 mg/dL
Lipase 82 U/L
Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant shows dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder. The pancreas is not well visualized. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and metronidazole are initiated. After 12 hours, the patient appears acutely ill and is not oriented to time. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), the pulse is 105/min, the respirations are 22/min, and the blood pressure is 112/82 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of ascending cholangitis, which is a medical emergency. The patient has a fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice, and the ultrasound shows dilated bile ducts and gallstones. The patient's worsening condition over 12 hours, including altered mental status, suggests that the infection is progressing.

ERCP is the most appropriate next step in management because it allows for both diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. ERCP can be used to visualize the biliary tree, diagnose the cause of the obstruction, and perform therapeutic interventions such as sphincterotomy, stone extraction, and stent placement to relieve the obstruction and drain the infected bile.

While abdominal CT scan (Option A) may provide additional information about the extent of the disease, it is not a therapeutic intervention and would not address the patient's immediate needs. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Option C) is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient's primary problem is the infected bile duct, not the gallbladder. MRCP (Option D) is a diagnostic test that may provide additional information, but it would not provide therapeutic benefit. Percutaneous cholecystostomy (Option E) may be used to drain the gallbladder, but it would not address the underlying problem of the infected bile duct.",Success
"A 62-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor with continued hypertension despite adherence to multiple anti-hypertensive medications. The physician suspects that the patient may have elevated aldosterone levels and wants to initiate a trial of an aldosterone receptor antagonist. The patient is very concerned about side effects, particularly impotence and gynecomastia, as he had a friend who took a similar medication and had these side-effects. Which of the following is the best medication to initiate, given his concerns and the physician's diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Eplerenone.

The patient is concerned about impotence and gynecomastia, which are known side effects of spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic that is also an aldosterone receptor antagonist. Eplerenone, on the other hand, is a more selective aldosterone receptor antagonist that is less likely to cause these side effects. It is a good alternative to spironolactone for patients who are concerned about these specific side effects.",Success
"A 30-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a recent episode of chest pain. She says she was previously well and denies any history of similar symptoms. She reports that, at onset, she felt as if she was going to die and says her heart beating has been beating really fast. There was also profuse sweating, and she says she feels short of breath. She could not recall how long the event lasted but can remember that the symptoms did go away on their own by the time she arrived at the emergency department. Her vitals rapidly returned to normal while giving her medical history and she begins to look and act more calm. No significant past medical history or current medications.  Physical examination is unremarkable. Her electrocardiogram and initial cardiac enzymes are normal. Which the following is necessary to confirm the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is B. Average of 1 disruptive event per week.

The patient's symptoms, such as chest pain, rapid heartbeat, profuse sweating, and shortness of breath, are consistent with a panic attack. The most likely diagnosis is panic disorder. To confirm this diagnosis, the patient would need to experience recurrent panic attacks, which are defined as an average of at least one attack per week over a period of one month.",Success
"A previously healthy 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation because of loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme irritability for the past 3 weeks. He was recently kicked off of the school's football team after missing too many practices. He has also been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them, but he admits that he is lonely. He has not left his room for 2 days, which prompted his father to bring him to the physician. He has no medical conditions and does not take any medications. He does not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. While the father is in the waiting room, a mental status examination is conducted, which shows a constricted affect. Cognition is intact. He says that he would be better off dead and refuses to be treated. He says he wants to use his father's licensed firearm to “end his misery” over the weekend when his parents are at church. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents.

The patient is exhibiting symptoms of depression, including loss of appetite, sleeplessness, irritability, social withdrawal, and feelings of loneliness. He also has suicidal ideation, stating that he would be better off dead and expressing a plan to use his father's firearm to end his life. This is a serious and immediate risk to his safety, and involuntary hospitalization is necessary to prevent harm to himself.

Agreeing to his wish for no further treatment (Option A) is not appropriate, as it would neglect the patient's serious mental health needs and put him at risk of harm. Beginning paroxetine therapy (Option B) may be a treatment option, but it is not the most immediate priority, and the patient's suicidal ideation must be addressed first. Reassuring the patient that he will feel better (Option D) is not sufficient, as it does not address the patient's immediate risk of harm. Starting outpatient psychotherapy (Option E) may be a long-term treatment option, but it is not appropriate in this acute crisis situation.",Success

There is a non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy present. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Molluscum contagiosum.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with molluscum contagiosum, a viral skin infection that causes small, painless bumps on the skin. The presence of central umbilication in each papule is a characteristic feature of molluscum contagiosum. The patient's history of intravenous drug use and non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy also support this diagnosis.

Kaposi sarcoma (Option A) is a cancer that occurs in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS. While the patient's history of intravenous drug use increases his risk of HIV infection, the skin lesions described are not consistent with Kaposi sarcoma.

Bed bug bites (Option B) can cause itchy, red bumps on the skin, but they are not typically hardened or umbilicated.

Atopic dermatitis (Option D) is a chronic skin condition characterized by dry, itchy skin and inflammation. It does not typically cause small, hardened papules with central umbilication.

At the hospital, her temperature is 40.3°C (104.5°F), blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical exam, the patient appears to have altered mental status and her skin is dry, hot, and erythematous. She is complaining of severe bilateral flank pain and generalized myalgia. Catheterization produces 200 mL of tea-colored urine. Urine dipstick is positive for blood, but urinalysis is negative for RBCs or WBCs. Which of the following is most likely responsible for her condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Heat stroke.

The patient's symptoms, such as altered mental status, dry, hot, and erythematous skin, and a high temperature (40.3°C or 104.5°F), are consistent with heat stroke. The presence of tea-colored urine and a positive urine dipstick for blood, but a negative urinalysis for RBCs or WBCs, suggests rhabdomyolysis, which is a common complication of heat stroke.

Heat exhaustion (option C) is a milder heat-related illness that is characterized by a normal mental status and a lower body temperature.

The patient's family history of chronic kidney disease, bilateral hearing loss, and vision problems in her father suggests a possible genetic component, but it is not directly related to her current condition. Alport syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the COL4A5 gene (option A), is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, ears, and eyes, but it is not typically associated with heat-related illnesses.

Neisseria meningitides (option B) is a bacterium that can cause meningitis and sepsis, but it is not typically associated with heat-related illnesses or rhabdomyolysis.

His blood pressure is 122/74 mm Hg, heart rate is 75/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. What is the appropriate step in the management of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is B. Addition of bupropion.

The patient is experiencing sexual side effects, specifically weak tumescence and low libido, which are common adverse effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like citalopram. Bupropion is an antidepressant that is known to have a lower risk of sexual side effects compared to SSRIs. Adding bupropion to the patient's regimen may help alleviate these symptoms.

Lowering the dose of citalopram (Option A) may not be effective in addressing the sexual side effects, and may even compromise the patient's anxiety symptoms. Switching to fluoxetine (Option C) is not a good option, as it is also an SSRI and may have similar sexual side effects. Adding sildenafil (Option D) may help with erectile dysfunction, but it does not address the underlying issue of low libido.

Blood smear shows mature lymphocytes that rupture easily and appear as artifacts on a blood smear. Flow cytometry shows lymphocytes expressing CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?""",C,"The correct answer is C. Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. The presence of mature lymphocytes that rupture easily and appear as artifacts on a blood smear, along with the expression of CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23 on flow cytometry, support this diagnosis.

The treatment of CLL typically involves chemotherapy, and the combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab is a commonly used regimen. Fludarabine is a purine analog that inhibits DNA synthesis, cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that damages DNA, and rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen on B cells.

Option A, chlorambucil only, is an older treatment for CLL, but it is not as effective as the combination regimen.

Option B, all-trans retinoic acid, is a treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia, not CLL.

Option D, observation and disease progression monitoring, may be appropriate for asymptomatic patients with early-stage CLL, but this patient's symptoms and laboratory results indicate that treatment is necessary.

He is diaphoretic and intermittently conscious. Bilateral rales are heard on pulmonary auscultation. An electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in leads I and aVL. Despite appropriate management, the patient expires. An autopsy is performed demonstrating ischemia in the left atrium and posterior left ventricle. Which of the following vessels was most likely affected in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Left circumflex artery.

The patient's symptoms and electrocardiogram (ECG) findings suggest an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) involving the lateral wall of the left ventricle. The ST elevations in leads I and aVL are consistent with a lateral wall MI. The autopsy findings of ischemia in the left atrium and posterior left ventricle further support this diagnosis.

The left circumflex artery is the most likely vessel affected in this patient because it supplies blood to the lateral wall of the left ventricle, including the posterior left ventricle and left atrium. The left circumflex artery is a branch of the left coronary artery and is responsible for perfusing the lateral and posterior aspects of the left ventricle.

The other options are not as likely:

A. Left anterior descending artery: This artery supplies blood to the anterior wall of the left ventricle, not the lateral wall.

C. Left coronary artery: While the left coronary artery is the parent vessel of the left circumflex artery, it is not the specific vessel affected in this patient.

D. Posterior descending artery: This artery is a branch of the right coronary artery and supplies blood to the posterior wall of the right ventricle, not the left ventricle.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with tabes dorsalis, a late manifestation of syphilis. The patient's history of a painless ulcer on his penis 20 years ago suggests untreated syphilis. The physical examination findings of small pupils that constrict with accommodation but do not react to light (Argyll Robertson pupils), decreased sensation to pinprick and light touch in the distal lower extremities, absent patellar reflexes, and unsteady gait are all consistent with tabes dorsalis.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Dantrolene.

The patient's symptoms, including muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and altered mental status, are consistent with malignant hyperthermia (MH), a life-threatening medical emergency. MH is often triggered by certain medications, such as succinylcholine, or by other substances, such as alcohol or stimulants.

Dantrolene is a specific treatment for MH, and it is the best next step in management. It works by reducing the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which helps to relax muscle tone and reduce heat production.

Acetaminophen (A) is not effective in treating MH, and it may even exacerbate the condition by increasing heat production. Diazepam (C) is a benzodiazepine that may help with muscle relaxation, but it is not a specific treatment for MH. Intubation (D) may be necessary to protect the patient's airway, but it is not the primary treatment for MH. Supportive therapy (E) is important, but it is not enough to treat MH, and dantrolene should be administered as soon as possible.",Success
A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of pain in his right knee for the past week. The pain is exacerbated by jogging and climbing up stairs. He has no history of trauma to the knee. He is otherwise healthy. He is an active member of his school's gymnastics team. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right knee shows a tender swelling at the proximal tibia; range of motion is full. Knee extension against resistance causes pain in the anterior proximal tibia. The remainder of the examinations shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the right knee shows anterior tibial soft tissue swelling with fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?,A,"The correct answer is A. Administration of oral ketorolac.

The patient's symptoms and X-ray findings are consistent with Osgood-Schlatter disease, a common condition in adolescents that affects the tibial tuberosity. The condition is caused by repetitive strain on the patellar tendon, leading to inflammation and fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity.

The most appropriate next step is to administer oral ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), to reduce pain and inflammation. This is a conservative approach to manage the symptoms, and it is often effective in relieving pain and promoting healing.

The other options are not appropriate:

B. Joint aspiration is not necessary, as the X-ray findings are consistent with Osgood-Schlatter disease, and there is no indication of infection or other conditions that would require aspiration.

C. Open reduction of the tuberosity is not necessary, as the condition is typically managed conservatively with rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) and NSAIDs.

D. Administration of oral methotrexate is not indicated, as it is a medication used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, and it is not effective in managing Osgood-Schlatter disease.

E. Application of a lower leg cast is not necessary, as the condition does not require immobilization, and a cast would likely interfere with the patient's ability to participate in gymnastics.",Success
"Three days after undergoing an open cholecystectomy, an obese 57-year-old woman has fever, chills, and a headache. She has right-sided chest pain that increases on inspiration and has had a productive cough for the last 12 hours. She had an episode of hypotension after the operation that resolved with intravenous fluid therapy. She underwent an abdominal hysterectomy 16 years ago for multiple fibroids of the uterus. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 17 years. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg. Inspiratory crackles are heard at the right lung base. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There is a healing surgical incision below the right ribcage. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Pneumonia.

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, chills, headache, and productive cough, are consistent with pneumonia. The presence of inspiratory crackles at the right lung base on physical examination also supports this diagnosis. The patient's recent surgery and episode of hypotension may have increased her risk of developing pneumonia. While pulmonary embolism (A) is a possible complication of surgery, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with pneumonia. Subphrenic abscess (B) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and the fact that the abdomen is soft and nontender. Atelectasis (D) may occur after surgery, but it is less likely to cause fever, chills, and productive cough. Pneumothorax (E) is also unlikely given the patient's symptoms and the absence of any signs of respiratory distress.",Success
"A 55-year-old man presents with a red rash over his face for the last 3 months. The patient says he moved to Nevada 6 months ago because of a new job where he works outdoors; however, he worked indoors in an office before. His vital signs include: blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, pulse 64/min, respiratory rate 18/min. The patient’s rash is shown in the exhibit. Which of the following is the best initial step in the treatment of this patient?",C,"The correct answer is A. Oral tetracycline.

The patient's symptoms and rash are consistent with rosacea, a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by facial redness, flushing, and acne-like lesions. The patient's recent move to Nevada and outdoor work suggest that he may be experiencing increased sun exposure, which can exacerbate rosacea.

Oral tetracycline is a common and effective treatment for rosacea, particularly for the papulopustular subtype, which is characterized by acne-like lesions. It helps to reduce inflammation and kill bacteria that can contribute to the condition.

The other options are not the best initial step in treatment:

B. Oral clonidine is a medication used to treat hypertension, but it is not typically used to treat rosacea.

C. Topical metronidazole is an antibiotic cream that can be used to treat rosacea, but it is not as effective as oral tetracycline for moderate to severe cases.

D. Topical benzoyl peroxide is typically used to treat acne, not rosacea.

E. Vascular laser treatment may be used to treat the telangiectasias (small blood vessels) that can occur in rosacea, but it is not a first-line treatment for the condition.",Success
"A previously healthy 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain during exercise for the last 6 months. She does not smoke. Her maternal uncle had similar symptoms. Cardiac examination shows wide splitting of S2. The second component of S2 is loud and best heard at the 2nd left intercostal space. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's cardiac findings?",C,"The correct answer is B. Increased left ventricular preload.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of atrial septal defect (ASD). The wide splitting of S2 and the loud second component of S2 best heard at the 2nd left intercostal space are characteristic of ASD. This is because the ASD allows oxygenated blood to flow from the left atrium to the right atrium, increasing the volume of blood flowing through the right ventricle and pulmonary valve, which causes the pulmonary component of S2 to be loud.

Increased left ventricular preload is the most likely cause of this patient's cardiac findings because the ASD allows excess blood to flow into the right atrium and ventricle, which then flows into the lungs, increasing the preload on the left ventricle.",Success
An 11-year-old boy presents to your office with pitting edema and proteinuria exceeding 3.5g in 24 hours. You suspect that this patient has experienced a loss of polyanions in his glomerular basement membranes. Which of the following findings would confirm your diagnosis?,C,"The correct answer is C. Selective albuminuria.

The patient's symptoms, including pitting edema and proteinuria exceeding 3.5g in 24 hours, are consistent with nephrotic syndrome. The loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membrane can lead to the loss of negatively charged molecules, such as albumin, in the urine. Selective albuminuria, which is the presence of albumin in the urine without other proteins, would confirm this diagnosis.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. WBC casts in the urine are indicative of a urinary tract infection or inflammation, not nephrotic syndrome.

B. RBC casts in the urine are indicative of glomerular damage or inflammation, not nephrotic syndrome.

D. Negatively birefringent crystals in the urine are indicative of uric acid stones or gout, not nephrotic syndrome.

An MRI of the head and neck is shown. This patient's condition is most likely the result of nerve root compression by a structure derived from which of the following embryologic layers?",C,"The correct answer is B. Neural crest.

The MRI of the head and neck shows a herniated disk, which is compressing the nerve root and causing the patient's symptoms. The herniated disk is derived from the neural crest, which is one of the three primary germ layers in embryonic development. The neural crest gives rise to various structures, including the meninges, bones, and connective tissue of the head and neck, as well as the disks between the vertebrae.",Success
"A 32-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her friend for acute onset abdominal pain. She states that she was in a kickboxing class when she suddenly developed left-sided abdominal pain. Her past medical history is significant for chlamydia. She is currently sexually active and does not use contraception. Her menstrual periods occur regularly every 30 days. Her last menstrual period ended 2 days ago. The patient’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 110/68 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On physical exam, there is left-sided, lower abdominal tenderness and guarding. Pelvic examination is notable for clear mucous in the vaginal introitus and tenderness of the left adnexa. A pelvic ultrasound with Doppler reveals a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is C. Ovarian torsion.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with ovarian torsion. The sudden onset of left-sided abdominal pain, especially after physical activity, is a common presentation of ovarian torsion. The presence of guarding and tenderness on the left side of the abdomen, as well as tenderness of the left adnexa on pelvic examination, also support this diagnosis. The pelvic ultrasound with Doppler showing a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch is also consistent with ovarian torsion.

While ectopic pregnancy (option A) is a possibility, the patient's regular menstrual periods and lack of vaginal bleeding make it less likely. Mittelschmerz (option B) is a benign condition that occurs mid-cycle and is not typically associated with severe pain or guarding. Pelvic inflammatory disease (option D) is also possible, but the patient's lack of fever and normal white blood cell count make it less likely. Ruptured ovarian cyst (option E) is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings are more consistent with ovarian torsion.",Success
"A 63-year-old man from the countryside presents with leg swelling and right upper abdominal tenderness. He reports a history of myocardial infarction 4 years ago, but he has no supporting documentation. At the moment, his only medication is aspirin. He also stated that he used to have ‘high blood sugars’ when checked in the hospital 4 years ago, but he did not follow up regarding this issue. He works as a farmer and noticed that it became much harder for him to work in the last few days because of fatigue and syncope. He has a 24-pack-year history of smoking and consumes alcohol occasionally. The vital signs include: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). On physical examination, the patient is pale and acrocyanotic. There is a visible jugular vein distention and bilateral lower leg pitting edema. The pulmonary auscultation is significant for occasional bilateral wheezes. Cardiac auscultation is significant for a decreased S1, S3 gallop, and grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border in the 4th left intercostal space. Abdominal percussion and palpation are suggestive of ascites. The hepatic margin is 3 cm below the right costal margin. Hepatojugular reflux is positive. Which of the following is the most likely clinical finding observed in this patient on an echocardiogram?",B,"The correct answer is B. Increased peak tricuspid regurgitation.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest right heart failure, which is likely caused by tricuspid regurgitation. The jugular vein distention, bilateral lower leg pitting edema, and ascites are all indicative of right heart failure. The hepatojugular reflux is also consistent with this diagnosis. Tricuspid regurgitation would cause an increase in peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity on echocardiogram.

Option A is unlikely because the patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest right heart failure, not left heart failure. Option C is also unlikely because the patient's symptoms do not suggest a left ventricular wall motion abnormality. Option D is possible, but it is not as specific to the patient's symptoms and physical examination as option B. Option E is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest increased right atrial pressure, not decreased.",Success
"A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of difficulty discarding items in her home. She says that the accumulation of things in her kitchen and dining room makes regular use of these spaces incredibly difficult. Her behavior started when she was in high school. She feels anxious when she tries to discard her possessions and her husband tries to clean and organize the home. This behavior frustrates her because most of the items she saves have little emotional or monetary value.

On mental status examination, she is calm, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. Her mood is depressed; her speech is organized, logical, and coherent; and there are no psychotic symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Fluoxetine.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with hoarding disorder, which is characterized by difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value, and a perceived need to save them. The patient's anxiety when trying to discard items, feelings of frustration, and lack of improvement with cognitive behavioral therapy suggest that medication may be necessary.

Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has been shown to be effective in treating hoarding disorder. SSRIs have been found to reduce symptoms of hoarding, including difficulty discarding items and clutter.

A radiograph of this patient’s right hip would most likely reveal which of the following?",E,"The correct answer is B. Irregular blastic lesion.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of Paget's disease of bone. The elevated alkaline phosphatase level and normal calcium and phosphate levels are consistent with this diagnosis. Paget's disease is a chronic bone disorder characterized by excessive bone resorption and formation, leading to irregularly shaped bones.

A radiograph of the right hip would likely reveal an irregular blastic lesion, which is a characteristic feature of Paget's disease. The other options are not consistent with Paget's disease:

A. Expansile lytic lesion with thin sclerotic margins is more consistent with a benign bone tumor, such as an aneurysmal bone cyst.

C. Medullary bone destruction with elevated periosteum from cortical bone is more consistent with a malignant bone tumor, such as osteosarcoma.

Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. CMP, CBC, and TSH are normal. A urine toxicology test is negative. What is the patient’s most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Brief psychotic disorder.

The patient's symptoms, including hearing voices and having intrusive thoughts, are consistent with a psychotic episode. The fact that these symptoms started suddenly after a stressful event (her father's death) and have lasted for less than a month suggests a diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder. This diagnosis is characterized by a sudden onset of psychotic symptoms that last for at least 1 day but less than 1 month, and are often triggered by a stressful event.

Adjustment disorder (option C) is not the correct diagnosis because it does not typically involve psychotic symptoms. Schizophreniform disorder (option B) is a possibility, but it requires that the symptoms last for at least 1 month but less than 6 months. Schizophrenia (option D) is also a possibility, but it typically involves a more chronic course of symptoms.

Examination of the eyes reveals bilateral exophthalmos. An electrocardiogram is obtained and shown in the picture. Which of the following has a strong positive correlation with this patient’s heart rhythm?",D,"The correct answer is D. Age.

The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial fibrillation (AFib), which is an irregular heart rhythm characterized by the absence of P waves and an irregular R-R interval. The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and ECG are consistent with thyrotoxicosis, a condition caused by an overactive thyroid gland.

Atrial fibrillation is a common complication of thyrotoxicosis, and its incidence increases with age. Therefore, age has a strong positive correlation with this patient's heart rhythm.

After further testing, the physician prescribes a thiazide for this patient. Which of the following diseases is also associated with this patient's most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is C. Sjogren syndrome.

The patient's symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, weakness, and back/leg pain, are consistent with hypokalemia (low potassium levels). The EKG finding of flattened T waves also supports this diagnosis. The recent administration of an antibiotic during her travels suggests that she may have developed hypokalemia due to antibiotic-induced diarrhea, leading to potassium loss.

The prescription of a thiazide diuretic further supports this diagnosis, as thiazides can cause potassium loss and worsen hypokalemia.

Tracheobronchial rupture.

The patient's presentation with subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area and a recurrent pneumothorax despite proper chest tube placement suggests a tracheobronchial rupture. This is a common injury in high-energy trauma, such as a head-on motor vehicle collision. The presence of subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area is a hallmark sign of tracheobronchial rupture. The recurrent pneumothorax despite proper chest tube placement suggests that the chest tube is not effectively draining the air leak, which is consistent with a tracheobronchial rupture.",Success

A 34-year-old man comes to the physician because of frequent headaches and blurry vision during the past 4 months. He has also had difficulties achieving an erection over the past few weeks. Physical examination shows a temporal visual field deficit bilaterally. An MRI of the brain shows an intrasellar mass. The mass is most likely derived from which of the following types of cells?,B,"The correct answer is B. Lactotrophs.

The symptoms described, such as frequent headaches, blurry vision, and temporal visual field deficits, are consistent with a pituitary tumor compressing the optic chiasm. The additional symptom of erectile dysfunction suggests a deficiency in gonadotropins, which are hormones that stimulate the gonads (testes or ovaries).

Given the location of the tumor in the sella turcica (intrasellar mass) and the symptoms, the most likely type of cell that the tumor is derived from is lactotrophs, which produce prolactin. Prolactin is a hormone that stimulates lactation in females, but elevated levels in males can cause erectile dysfunction, among other symptoms.

Which of the following treatments is most reasonable to offer this patient?",A,"The correct answer is C. Space-filling pessary.

The patient is experiencing a feeling of a foreign body in her vagina, which worsens on standing, indicating a degree of vaginal prolapse. The physical examination reveals descent of the cervix halfway towards the introitus, and on Valsalva and standing, the cervix descends to the plane of the hymen, indicating a moderate degree of uterine prolapse.

A space-filling pessary is a type of pessary that is designed to fill the vagina and provide support to the uterus and vaginal walls. It is a reasonable treatment option for this patient because it can help to alleviate her symptoms of vaginal pressure and discomfort. Additionally, a space-filling pessary is a non-surgical treatment option that can be tried before considering surgical interventions.

Option A, a support pessary, may not be effective in this patient because it is designed to support the uterus and vaginal walls, but may not provide enough support to alleviate the patient's symptoms.

"A 24-year-old married woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain since last night. She also complains of scant vaginal bleeding. She says she visited a physician last year who said she had a pelvic infection, but she was never treated because of insurance issues. She also says her period has been delayed this month. She is afebrile. The pulse is 124/min and the blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. On examination, her abdomen is distended and tender. A pregnancy test was positive. A complication of infection with which of the following organisms most likely led to this patient’s condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Chlamydia trachomatis.

The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, which is a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Chlamydia trachomatis is a common cause of PID, and untreated PID can increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. The patient's history of a pelvic infection last year that was not treated due to insurance issues, combined with her current symptoms of abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and a positive pregnancy test, support this diagnosis.",Success
A 44-year-old man comes to the clinic because of a 6-month history of progressive fatigue. He has a history of intravenous heroin use. Physical examination shows scleral icterus. A serum study is positive for hepatitis C RNA. Therapy with interferon-α is initiated in combination with a second drug. The expected beneficial effect of the additional drug is most likely due to inhibition of which of the following enzymes?,B,"The correct answer is B. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase.

The patient is being treated for hepatitis C with interferon-α and a second drug, which is likely ribavirin. Ribavirin is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of guanosine nucleotides. This inhibition leads to a decrease in the intracellular pool of guanosine triphosphate, which is required for viral RNA synthesis. As a result, ribavirin enhances the antiviral effect of interferon-α against hepatitis C virus.",Success
"A 42-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of fatigue. He has not been to the doctor since he was 22 years of age. He reports that over the past three months, he has felt tired and weak despite no changes in diet or exercise. He is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. Family history is notable for colorectal cancer in his father and paternal uncle, ovarian cancer in his paternal grandmother, and pancreatic cancer in his paternal uncle. Physical examination is notable for conjunctival pallor. A complete blood count reveals a hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL and hematocrit of 31%. A stool sample is hemoccult positive and a colonoscopy reveals a fungating hemorrhagic mass in the ascending colon. Which of the following processes is most likely impaired in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Mismatch repair.

The patient's family history is suggestive of Lynch syndrome, a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by mutations in mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2). The presence of colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, and pancreatic cancer in the patient's family members is consistent with this diagnosis.

Mismatch repair is a process that corrects errors in DNA replication and recombination. Defects in mismatch repair lead to microsatellite instability, which is a hallmark of Lynch syndrome.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's presentation and family history:

A. Homologous recombination is a process of DNA repair that is involved in the repair of double-strand breaks.

B. Base excision repair is a process that corrects damage to individual bases in DNA.

C. Nucleotide excision repair is a process that corrects damage to DNA caused by ultraviolet light.

"A 38-year-old woman presents to an urgent care clinic with the complaint of epigastric discomfort and cramping pain for the past 2 hours. She states that she has experienced similar pain in the past. These episodes occur mostly after meals and often subside several hours after she finishes eating. Due to this reason she mostly avoids eating. She says she has lost a few pounds in the last couple of months. She is a smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. Past medical history is insignificant except for chronic knee pain, for which she takes over the counter painkillers. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respiratory rate is 16/min, pulse is 77/min, and blood pressure is 120/89 mm Hg. A physical abdominal exam is unremarkable, including examination of the abdomen. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Gastric peptic ulcer.

The patient's symptoms of epigastric discomfort and cramping pain, especially after meals, are consistent with a gastric peptic ulcer. The fact that she has experienced similar pain in the past and has learned to avoid eating to alleviate the symptoms also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's smoking history and use of over-the-counter painkillers for chronic knee pain may have contributed to the development of a gastric ulcer. The physical abdominal exam being unremarkable also points towards a gastric peptic ulcer, as it is often not associated with significant abdominal tenderness.",Success
"A 19-year-old female college soccer player presents to a sports medicine clinic with right knee pain. One day prior she twisted her right knee and felt a “pop” while chasing after a ball. She has since felt severe throbbing knee pain and noticed a rapid increase in swelling around her knee. She is able to bear weight but feels “unstable” on her right leg. On exam, anterior drawer and Lachman’s tests are positive. The physician informs her that she has likely injured an important structure in her knee. What is the function of the structure that she has most likely injured?",B,"The correct answer is B. Prevent excess anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur.

The patient's symptoms and positive anterior drawer and Lachman's tests suggest that she has likely injured her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The ACL is a crucial ligament in the knee that prevents excessive anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur, meaning it prevents the tibia from sliding forward in relation to the femur.",Success
"Six hours after birth, a newborn boy is evaluated for tachypnea. He was delivered at 41 weeks' gestation via Caesarian section and the amniotic fluid was meconium-stained. His respiratory rate is 75/min. Physical examination shows increased work of breathing. X-rays of the abdomen and chest show no abnormalities. Echocardiography shows elevated pulmonary artery pressure. He is started on an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP, and there is immediate improvement in his tachypnea and oxygenation status. Three hours later, the newborn is tachypneic and there is blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this infant's cyanosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Oxidization of Fe2+ to Fe3+.

The inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP is likely nitric oxide, which is used to treat pulmonary hypertension. However, nitric oxide can also cause methemoglobinemia, a condition in which hemoglobin is oxidized to methemoglobin, leading to blue-grey discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes. This is due to the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ in the hemoglobin molecule, which reduces its ability to carry oxygen.",Success
A study is conducted to determine the most effective ways to prevent transmission of various infective agents. One of the agents studied is a picornavirus that preferentially infects hepatocytes. The investigator determines that inactivating this virus can prevent its spread. Which of the following disinfectants is most likely to inactivate this virus?,C,"The correct answer is C. Sodium hypochlorite.

Picornaviruses, which include hepatitis A virus, are sensitive to sodium hypochlorite (bleach). Sodium hypochlorite is a strong oxidizing agent that can denature proteins and disrupt the viral capsid, making it an effective disinfectant against picornaviruses.

Benzalkonium chloride (A) and chlorhexidine (B) are quaternary ammonium compounds that are effective against some viruses, but not as effective against picornaviruses. Sulfuric acid (D) is a strong acid that can be corrosive and is not typically used as a disinfectant. Ethyl alcohol (E) can be effective against some viruses, but it is not as effective against picornaviruses as sodium hypochlorite.",Success
"A 34-year-old woman comes to the physician requesting prenatal care. For the past 2 months, she has had increasing breast tenderness, nausea, 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight gain, and urinary frequency. She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period. She has been trying to conceive with her husband since she stopped taking oral contraceptives 6 months ago; she was happy to tell him last week that she is pregnant.

Urine β-hCG is negative. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Pseudocyesis.

Pseudocyesis, also known as false pregnancy, is a condition in which a woman believes she is pregnant, but there is no actual pregnancy. The symptoms described, such as breast tenderness, nausea, weight gain, and urinary frequency, are common in early pregnancy, but the negative urine β-hCG test and normal transvaginal ultrasonography suggest that the woman is not actually pregnant. The fact that she is convinced she is pregnant and has even told her husband, despite the lack of objective evidence, supports the diagnosis of pseudocyesis.",Success
"A 60-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine physical examination. He lives in a group home and takes no medications. During the appointment, he frequently repeats the same information and needs to be reminded why he is at the doctor's office.

Neurological examination shows no focal deficits. On mental status examination, he has no long-term memory deficits and is able to count in serial sevens without error. An MRI of the brain shows atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies. Which of the following is the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Alcohol use disorder.

The patient's symptoms, such as frequent repetition of information, lack of awareness of his surroundings, and confabulation (making up stories, e.g., being a famous poet), are consistent with Korsakoff syndrome. The MRI findings of atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies also support this diagnosis.

Korsakoff syndrome is a chronic memory disorder caused by a deficiency of thiamine (Vitamin B1), often seen in individuals with a history of alcohol use disorder. The syndrome is characterized by anterograde amnesia (inability to form new memories) and confabulation.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and MRI findings:

A. Consumption of undercooked meat is associated with trichinosis, a parasitic infection.

B. Chronic hypertension is a risk factor for various cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, but it is not directly related to Korsakoff syndrome.

C. Intravenous heroin use is associated with opioid use disorder and infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis, but it is not directly related to Korsakoff syndrome.

"A medical student decides to join an immunology research center, which specifically works on capsular polysaccharide vaccine development against bacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. As a member of a research team working on the Hib vaccine, he asks his senior colleague why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers like tetanus toxoid during vaccine development. Which of the following is the best response to this question?",E,"The correct answer is A. Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgG2 dominant antibody responses.

Capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers like tetanus toxoid during vaccine development because it converts a T-cell independent antigen into a T-cell dependent antigen. This allows for the activation of T-cells, which is important for the development of immunological memory and the production of IgG antibodies, particularly IgG2. This is especially important for infants, who are unable to mount an effective immune response to polysaccharide antigens alone. Conjugation with a protein carrier enables the development of a more robust and long-lasting immune response.",Success
An investigator is studying the pattern of glutamate release from presynaptic nerve terminals in human volunteers with Alzheimer disease. The concentration of glutamate in the CA1 region of the hippocampus is measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy after Schaffer collateral fibers are electrically stimulated. Which of the following events most likely occurs immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters?,E,"The correct answer is E. Influx of calcium.

Here's why:

The question describes an experiment where the investigator is studying the release of glutamate from presynaptic nerve terminals in response to electrical stimulation of Schaffer collateral fibers. This is a classic scenario for studying neurotransmitter release.

The correct answer is E. Influx of calcium because calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels is the event that immediately precedes the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic terminal. When an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open, allowing calcium ions to flow into the terminal. This increase in intracellular calcium concentration triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, releasing the neurotransmitter (in this case, glutamate) into the synaptic cleft.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors is a postsynaptic event that occurs after neurotransmitter release.

B. Synthesis of glutamine is not directly related to the release of glutamate from presynaptic terminals.

C. Accumulation of cAMP is a second messenger pathway that can be involved in synaptic plasticity, but it is not directly involved in the release of neurotransmitters.

D. Opening of ligand-gated ion channels is a postsynaptic event that occurs after neurotransmitter release and binding to receptors.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman presents to a physician with a history of exposure to a close friend who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. She was told by her friend that she need to see a physician because she needs to be treated as well, even if she is not having symptoms yet. She currently denies any headaches, vision changes, nausea or vomiting, or neck stiffness. Her physical exam is within normal limits. Her vital signs are stable. She is prescribed rifampin for prophylaxis with specific instructions on when to follow up if symptoms develop. When asked about the possibility of pregnancy, she mentioned that she uses combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for contraception. The physician suggested that her husband should use condoms for contraception as she requires antibiotic therapy. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the need for additional contraception?",A,"The correct answer is A. Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens.

Rifampin, an antibiotic, can induce the metabolism of estrogen, leading to decreased levels of estrogen in the body. This is because rifampin increases the activity of certain enzymes in the liver that break down estrogen. Additionally, rifampin can alter the normal gastrointestinal flora, which can lead to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens. The enterohepatic circulation is a process by which estrogens are reabsorbed from the gut back into the bloodstream, allowing for a longer duration of action. By disrupting this process, rifampin can reduce the effectiveness of combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), which contain estrogen. Therefore, the physician recommends additional contraception, such as condoms, to prevent unintended pregnancy.",Success

The patient's symptoms, including episodic neck stiffness and pain, accompanied by rotation of the neck to the right, are consistent with a diagnosis of acute dystonic reaction, a common side effect of antipsychotic medications like haloperidol. The fact that the patient was able to relieve the stiffness by lightly touching his jaw suggests that the symptoms are related to the medication.

Benztropine is an anticholinergic medication that is commonly used to treat acute dystonic reactions caused by antipsychotic medications. It is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms.

Physical therapy (option B) is not a treatment for acute dystonic reaction. Dantrolene (option C) is a muscle relaxant that is used to treat malignant hyperthermia, a rare but life-threatening side effect of certain medications, but it is not indicated for acute dystonic reaction. Baclofen (option D) is a muscle relaxant that is used to treat spasticity, but it is not typically used to treat acute dystonic reaction. Propranolol (option E) is a beta blocker that is used to treat anxiety, hypertension, and other conditions, but it is not indicated for acute dystonic reaction.",Success
"A 31-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with fevers, chills, and night sweats. After a physical exam and a series of laboratory tests, the patient undergoes a lymph node biopsy (Image A). Three days later, while awaiting treatment, he presents to his physician complaining of generalized swelling and is found to have 4+ protein in his urine. Which of the following pathological findings is most likely to be found on renal biopsy in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Minimal change disease.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest that he has Hodgkin lymphoma, which is confirmed by the lymph node biopsy. The development of nephrotic syndrome (generalized swelling and 4+ protein in the urine) shortly after diagnosis is a known paraneoplastic syndrome associated with Hodgkin lymphoma. In this context, the most likely renal biopsy finding is minimal change disease, which is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults.",Success
"A microbiologist has isolated several colonies of Escherichia coli on an agar plate. The microbiologist exposes the agar plate to ciprofloxacin, which destroys all of the bacteria except for one surviving colony. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of antibiotic resistance in the surviving colony?",B,"The correct answer is B. Mutation of DNA gyrase.

Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that targets DNA gyrase, an enzyme essential for bacterial DNA replication. The most likely mechanism of antibiotic resistance in the surviving colony is a mutation in the DNA gyrase gene, which renders the enzyme insensitive to ciprofloxacin.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Replacement of D-alanine is related to vancomycin resistance, not ciprofloxacin resistance.

C. Inactivation by bacterial transferase is a mechanism of resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, not fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin.

D. Production of β-lactamase is a mechanism of resistance to β-lactam antibiotics like penicillins and cephalosporins, not fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin.

E. Modification of surface binding proteins is not a known mechanism of resistance to ciprofloxacin.",Success
"A 48-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his son with a fever over the past day. The patient’s son adds that his father has been having some behavioral problems, as well, and that he was complaining about bugs crawling over his skin this morning even though there were no insects. Past medical history is unremarkable. No current medications. The patient was an alcoholic for several years but abruptly quit drinking 5 days ago. The patient’s temperature is 40.0°C (104.0°F), pulse is 130/min, blood pressure is 146/88 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical examination, he is confused, restless, agitated, and lacks orientation to time, place or person. Which of the following the most appropriate initial course of treatment of this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Diazepam.

The patient's symptoms, including fever, confusion, agitation, and hallucinations (bugs crawling on his skin), are consistent with delirium tremens (DTs), a severe and potentially life-threatening withdrawal syndrome that can occur in individuals who have a history of heavy alcohol use and suddenly stop or significantly reduce their alcohol intake.

Diazepam, a benzodiazepine, is the most appropriate initial treatment for delirium tremens. It can help to reduce the severity of symptoms, prevent seizures, and promote sedation. Chlorpromazine, haloperidol, and clonidine are not typically used as first-line treatments for DTs, and phenytoin is an anticonvulsant that is not typically used for this condition.",Success
"Eight weeks after starting a new weight-loss medication, a 43-year-old woman with obesity comes to the physician because of greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence. She also complains of progressively worsening night-time vision. She has had no fever, chills, or vomiting. Physical examination shows dry, scaly skin on her extremities and face. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of action of the drug she is taking?",D,"The correct answer is D. Inhibition of lipase.

The symptoms described, such as greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence, are consistent with malabsorption of fat, which suggests that the medication is inhibiting lipase, an enzyme that breaks down fats. The additional symptoms of dry, scaly skin and worsening night-time vision are also consistent with a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin A, which can occur with malabsorption of fat.

The other options are not directly related to the symptoms described and are not likely to be the mechanism of action of the weight-loss medication.",Success
A 70-year-old man with chronic heart failure presents to the emergency department due to difficulty in breathing. The patient is a known hypertensive for 20 years maintained on amlodipine and telmisartan. The physician notes that he is also being given a diuretic that blocks the Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule. Which drug is being referred to in this case?,C,"The correct answer is C. Triamterene.

Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic that blocks the Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule, thereby reducing sodium reabsorption and increasing potassium excretion. It is often used in combination with other diuretics to reduce potassium loss.

Furosemide (A) is a loop diuretic that inhibits the Na+/K+/2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.

Hydrochlorothiazide (B) is a thiazide diuretic that inhibits the Na+/Cl- symporter in the distal convoluted tubule.

Acetazolamide (D) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that acts in the proximal convoluted tubule.

Eplerenone (E) is a potassium-sparing diuretic that blocks the aldosterone receptor, rather than blocking Na+ channels.",Success
"A 59-year-old man with a history of sickle cell disease presents to the emergency department for evaluation of his fever and night sweats. He is extremely lethargic and is unable to provide an adequate history to his physician. His wife noted that roughly 3 days ago, her husband mentioned that something bit him, but she cannot remember what exactly. The vital signs include blood pressure 85/67 mm Hg, pulse rate 107/min, and respiratory rate 35/min. Upon examination, the man is currently afebrile but is lethargic and pale. His spleen is surgically absent. There are some swollen bite marks on his right hand with red streaks extending to his elbow. Which of the following bites would be most concerning in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is C. Spider bite.

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and lethargy, are concerning for sepsis. The presence of swollen bite marks on his right hand with red streaks extending to his elbow suggests a necrotic lesion, which is consistent with a brown recluse spider bite. The fact that the patient has a history of sickle cell disease and is asplenic (surgically absent spleen) makes him more susceptible to severe infections, including those caused by spider bites. Brown recluse spider bites can cause necrotic lesions and can lead to severe systemic illness, including sepsis, in immunocompromised individuals.",Success
A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing weakness in both legs for 7 days. She also reports a tingling sensation in her legs that is exacerbated by taking a hot shower. She is sexually active with one male partner and does not use condoms. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.1°F). Physical examination shows decreased muscle strength and clonus in both lower extremities. Patellar reflex is 4+ bilaterally and plantar reflex shows an extensor response on both sides. Abdominal reflex is absent. An MRI of the brain is shown. Which of the following findings is most likely to further support the diagnosis in this patient?,C,"The correct answer is C. Presence of immunoglobulin bands on cerebrospinal fluid immunofixation.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The MRI of the brain likely shows lesions consistent with MS.

The presence of immunoglobulin bands on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immunofixation, also known as oligoclonal bands, is a common finding in MS and would further support the diagnosis. Oligoclonal bands are produced by plasma cells in the central nervous system and are a sign of intrathecal antibody production.

The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis of MS:

A. Positive antibody response to cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen in the serum is associated with syphilis, not MS.

B. Oligodendrocytes that stain positive for polyomavirus proteins on brain biopsy are associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus.

D. Identification of gram-positive cocci in groups on blood culture is associated with bacterial endocarditis, not MS.

E. Detection of high-affinity antibodies to dsDNA in the serum is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, not MS.",Success
A group of investigators is studying the association between a fire retardant chemical used on furniture and interstitial lung disease. They use hospital records to identify 50 people who have been diagnosed with interstitial lung disease. They also identify a group of 50 people without interstitial lung disease who are matched in age and geographic location to those with the disease. The participants' exposure to the chemical is assessed by surveys and home visits. Which of the following best describes this study design?,A,"The correct answer is A. Case-control study.

Here's why:

* The study identifies a group of people with a specific disease (interstitial lung disease) and a group of people without the disease, and compares their exposure to the fire retardant chemical. This is a hallmark of a case-control study.
* The study is not a cross-sectional study because it's not a snapshot of a population at a single point in time. Instead, it's a comparative study of two groups.
* It's not a case series because it's not just a description of a series of cases with a particular disease. There's a control group and a comparison being made.
* It's not a retrospective cohort study because it's not following a group of people over time to see who develops the disease. Instead, the disease has already been diagnosed, and the study is looking back to see if there's an association with the chemical.
* It's definitely not a randomized controlled trial because there's no randomization or intervention involved. The study is simply observing and comparing the two groups.",Success

"A 23-year-old woman presents to the hospital for elective surgery. However, due to an unexpected bleeding event, the physician had to order a blood transfusion to replace the blood lost in the surgery. After this, the patient became irritable and had difficulty breathing, suggesting an allergic reaction, which was immediately treated with epinephrine. This patient is otherwise healthy, and her history does not indicate any health conditions or known allergies. The physician suspects an immunodeficiency disorder that was not previously diagnosed. If serum is taken from this patient to analyze her condition further, which of the following would be expected?",C,"The correct answer is A. High IgM, low IgA, and IgE.

The patient's symptoms, such as an allergic reaction to the blood transfusion, suggest an immunodeficiency disorder. The fact that the patient had no prior history of allergies or health conditions suggests that the disorder may be related to a defect in the immune system.

The expected serum analysis in this case would show high levels of IgM, which is the first antibody produced in response to an infection, and low levels of IgA and IgE. This is consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by a defect in B-cell development and a lack of immunoglobulins A and E.",Success

"A 30-year-old G4P3 woman at 38 weeks gestation is admitted to the labor and delivery unit complaining of contractions every 5 minutes for the past hour. Her previous births have been via uncomplicated caesarean sections, but she wishes to attempt vaginal delivery this time. Her prenatal care is notable for gestational diabetes controlled with diet and exercise. The delivery is prolonged, but the patient's pain is controlled with epidural analgesia. She delivers a male infant with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Fundal massage is performed, but the placenta does not pass. The obstetrician manually removes the placenta, but a red mass protrudes through the vagina attached to the placenta. The patient loses 500 mL of blood over the next minute, during which her blood pressure decreases from 120/80 mmHg to 90/65 mmHg. What is the best next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Elevate posterior fornix.

The scenario describes a case of placenta accreta, a condition where the placenta abnormally adheres to the uterine wall. The red mass protruding through the vagina attached to the placenta is likely a portion of the placenta that has invaded the uterine wall. The patient is experiencing significant bleeding and hypotension.

Elevating the posterior fornix (the upper part of the vagina) can help to compress the bleeding vessels and temporarily control the hemorrhage. This is a temporary measure to stabilize the patient before further interventions.

Uterine artery ligation (A) may be considered in some cases of placenta accreta, but it is not the best next step in this scenario. Hysterectomy (B) may ultimately be necessary, but it is not the immediate next step. Intravenous oxytocin (C) is not indicated in this situation, as it can exacerbate bleeding. Red blood cell transfusion (E) may be necessary, but it is not the best next step in managing the bleeding.",Success

Transabdominal ultrasonography shows a mildly enlarged, diffusely hyperechoic liver. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these liver abnormalities?""",C,"The correct answer is C. Insulin resistance.

The patient's laboratory results and physical examination suggest non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is closely associated with insulin resistance. The patient's BMI is 36.3 kg/m2, indicating obesity, which is a major risk factor for NAFLD. The liver enzymes, particularly the alanine aminotransferase (ALT), are elevated, and the liver is palpated 2-3 cm below the right costal margin, suggesting hepatomegaly. The transabdominal ultrasonography shows a mildly enlarged, diffusely hyperechoic liver, which is consistent with fatty liver disease.

The other options are less likely:

A. Autoimmune liver damage: The patient's antinuclear antibody titers are only 1:20, which is not strongly suggestive of autoimmune liver disease. The smooth muscle antibody and anti-LKM1 antibody titers are negative, making autoimmune liver disease less likely.

B. Congestive hepatopathy: There is no evidence of congestive heart failure or liver congestion in the patient's history or physical examination.

D. Acetaminophen use: The patient's acetaminophen use is intermittent and not excessive, making it unlikely to cause the liver abnormalities.

E. Alcohol use: The patient's alcohol use is moderate (1-2 glasses of wine 2-3 times a week), which is not sufficient to cause the liver abnormalities.",Success
"A 16-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance from a soccer game. During the game, he was about to kick the ball when another player collided with his leg from the front.

Physical exam showed that his knee could be pushed posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion but it could not be pulled anteriorly in the same position. The anatomic structure that was most likely injured in this patient has which of the following characteristics?",E,"The correct answer is C. Runs medially from the lateral femoral condyle.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest a posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury. The PCL is a ligament that connects the lateral femoral condyle to the medial tibia, running medially from the lateral femoral condyle. It prevents posterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur. The fact that the knee can be pushed posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion but cannot be pulled anteriorly suggests a PCL injury.",Success
"A 64-year-old male with a past medical history of two myocardial infarctions presents to the emergency room with shortness of breath.

On exam, his oxygen saturation is 78%, his lungs have crackles throughout, and jugular venous pulsation is located at the earlobe. EKG and troponin levels are normal. Which of the following is consistent with this man's pulmonary physiology?",E,"The correct answer is D. Increased Aa gradient, normal surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance.

Here's why:

* The patient presents with shortness of breath, crackles in the lungs, and jugular venous distension, which suggests pulmonary edema due to congestive heart failure (CHF).
* The normal EKG and troponin levels rule out an acute coronary event.
* The patient's non-compliance with furosemide (a diuretic) likely contributed to the development of CHF.
* In pulmonary edema, the alveoli are filled with fluid, which increases the diffusion distance between the alveoli and the capillaries. This impairs gas exchange, leading to an increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (Aa gradient).
* The surface area for diffusion is not affected, as the alveoli are still present and functional.
* Therefore, the correct answer is D. Increased Aa gradient, normal surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance.",Success

Further evaluation revealed parasitemia and a few schistocytes, poikilocytes, and merozoites in tetrad formation. The findings are most consistent with which diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Babesiosis.

The symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with Babesiosis, a tick-borne parasitic infection caused by Babesia microti. The presence of basophilic ring- and pear-shaped structures inside many red cells and extracellular basophilic rings on Wright-Giemsa staining, as well as the presence of parasitemia, schistocytes, poikilocytes, and merozoites in tetrad formation, are characteristic of Babesiosis.

Malaria (Option A) can also cause parasitemia and abnormal red blood cell morphology, but the presence of tetrad formation and the specific morphology of the parasites are more consistent with Babesiosis.

Anaplasmosis (Option C) is a tick-borne disease that can cause fever, chills, and hematological abnormalities, but it does not typically cause parasitemia or the specific red blood cell morphology seen in this case.

Tuberculosis (Option D) is a bacterial infection that can cause fever, chills, and hematological abnormalities, but it is not typically associated with parasitemia or the specific red blood cell morphology seen in this case.

Jugular venous distention is present, and chest examination reveals fine crackles that do not clear with coughing. Chest X-ray shows pulmonary congestion, and 2-dimensional echocardiogram shows a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Atrial myxoma.

The symptoms and physical examination findings, such as shortness of breath, diastolic murmur, jugular venous distention, and pulmonary congestion, are consistent with a cardiac condition. The 2-dimensional echocardiogram showing a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum is a key finding that points to atrial myxoma, a type of benign tumor that can occur in the heart. The fact that the symptoms worsen when the patient lies on her left side is also consistent with atrial myxoma, as the tumor can obstruct the mitral valve and cause symptoms when the patient is in a certain position.

The other options are not supported by the symptoms and physical examination findings. Rheumatic fever (A) is a condition that typically occurs in children and is characterized by a rash, arthritis, and carditis. Innocent murmur (B) is a benign heart murmur that is not associated with any symptoms or cardiac conditions. Subacute infective endocarditis (C) is a bacterial infection of the heart valves, which is not consistent with the echocardiogram findings.

Physical exam is notable for decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities and a systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Bethanechol and intermittent straight catheterization.

The patient's symptoms suggest overflow incontinence, which is characterized by frequent urination of small volumes, nocturia, and incontinence. The physical exam findings of decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities suggest diabetic neuropathy, which can cause neurogenic bladder dysfunction. The patient's medications, including lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor), may also contribute to her incontinence.

Bethanechol is a cholinergic agonist that can help stimulate bladder contraction and improve urinary emptying. Intermittent straight catheterization can help drain the bladder and prevent overflow incontinence. This combination is the best treatment option for this patient.

Option B is incorrect because oxybutynin is an anticholinergic medication that can worsen urinary retention and overflow incontinence. Option C is incorrect because the patient's symptoms require treatment. Option D is incorrect because oxybutynin is not the best medication for this patient, and scheduled bathroom breaks may not be sufficient to manage her symptoms.

Therefore, sterilization with a chlorine-based solution is most likely to prevent transmission of C. diff to the next patient who will occupy the room.

Chlorhexidine-based solutions (option B) are effective against many bacteria, but not against C. diff spores. Iodine-based solutions (option C) may have some effect against C. diff, but they are not as effective as chlorine-based solutions. Isopropanol-based solutions (option D) are not effective against C. diff spores. Quaternary amine-based solutions (option E) are not effective against C. diff spores and may even help to spread the infection.",Success
"A 1-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her parents. They are concerned that she becomes lethargic and irritated between meals. They found that feeding her often with small servings helps. She was born at 39 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is meeting all developmental milestones. Her mother has one brother that occasionally requires blood transfusions. Today, her blood pressure is 55/33 mm Hg, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, and temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the infant is irritated. She is slightly jaundiced. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her blood work shows normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin. Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies are also ruled out. A Coombs test is negative. Red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal. The physician determined that these findings are related to an enzyme deficiency. Which of the following allosterically inhibits this enzyme?",A,"The correct answer is C. Adenosine monophosphate.

The symptoms described in the question, such as lethargy and irritability between meals, are consistent with hypoglycemia. The laboratory results, including normocytic anemia, elevated reticulocyte count, and decreased haptoglobin, suggest a diagnosis of pyruvate kinase deficiency, a rare genetic disorder that affects the enzyme pyruvate kinase.

Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is an allosteric inhibitor of pyruvate kinase, meaning that it binds to the enzyme and reduces its activity. This is a negative feedback mechanism that helps regulate glycolysis and prevent excessive glucose breakdown.",Success
"A 4-year-old boy presents for a routine checkup. The patient’s parents say he was doing well until a few weeks ago at which time he started to complain of daily abdominal cramps and occasional muscle pains. His mother also noticed that he has been less active than usual. The parents deny any complaints of headaches or convulsions. The family lives together in a house built in 1950. The patient’s temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg, pulse is 100/min and respirations are 20/min. Abdominal exam shows mild diffuse tenderness to palpation and normal bowel sounds. The patient’s height, weight, and head circumference are normal. Laboratory results are as follows:
Hemoglobin 7 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 72
Lead level (capillary blood) 15 mcg/dL
Lead level (venous blood) 60 mcg/dL
Findings on a peripheral blood smear are shown in the image. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), also known as succimer.

The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and peripheral blood smear findings are consistent with lead poisoning. The patient's lead level is elevated, and the blood smear shows basophilic stippling, which is a characteristic feature of lead poisoning.

The best treatment option for this patient is dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), also known as succimer. DMSA is an oral chelating agent that is effective in treating lead poisoning with blood lead levels between 45-69 mcg/dL. It is the recommended treatment for children with lead poisoning and is generally well-tolerated.

Calcium disodium edetate (EDTA) is also a chelating agent, but it is typically used in more severe cases of lead poisoning and is administered intravenously. Dimercaprol is another chelating agent, but it is typically used in combination with EDTA and is not recommended as a single agent for lead poisoning. Trientine and penicillamine are chelating agents used to treat other metal poisonings, such as copper and Wilson's disease, respectively.",Success
"A 39-year-old woman with poorly controlled systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents to her rheumatologist for a follow-up visit. She has had intermittent myalgias, arthralgias, fatigue, and skin rashes over the past 10 years that have acutely worsened over the past year. She works as a school teacher but reports that she has had to miss several days of work due to her symptoms. She has been on hydroxychloroquine for several years but does not feel that it is adequately controlling her symptoms. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, she is well-appearing and in no acute distress. She has erythematous, raised plaques with keratotic scaling and follicular plugging on her hands. The physician decides to trial the patient on low-dose prednisone to better control her symptoms. At 2 months of follow-up, she reports that her flares have subsided and she has been able to return to work full-time. If this patient continues this medication regimen, she will be at an elevated risk for developing which of the following?",A,"The correct answer is A. Femoral neck fracture.

The patient is taking low-dose prednisone to control her symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Long-term use of corticosteroids like prednisone can lead to osteoporosis, which increases the risk of fractures, particularly in the spine, hip, and wrist. The femoral neck is a common site for osteoporotic fractures, making option A the correct answer.

The other options are not directly related to the use of prednisone or osteoporosis:

* B. Femoral shaft fracture is not typically associated with osteoporosis or corticosteroid use.
* C. Meniscal tear is a type of knee injury, not related to prednisone use or osteoporosis.

"A 40-year-old woman presents with severe shortness of breath. The patient is unable to provide a history due to her breathing difficulties. The patient’s roommate says that she came home and found her in this state. She also says that they both occasionally take sleeping pills to help them fall asleep. Physical examination reveals an obese female, dyspneic with diminished chest wall movements. The patient’s A-a gradient is calculated to be 10 mm Hg. Which of the following most likely accounts for this patient’s symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Alveolar hypoventilation.

The patient's symptoms, including severe shortness of breath and diminished chest wall movements, suggest respiratory failure. The A-a gradient of 10 mm Hg is normal, which suggests that the problem is not with gas exchange in the lungs (options C, D, and E). The patient's history of taking sleeping pills and the physical examination findings of obesity and dyspnea suggest that the patient may have overdosed on the sleeping pills, leading to respiratory depression and alveolar hypoventilation.",Success
"A 74-year-old woman is brought to her primary care doctor by her adult son. The son says she has been very difficult at home and is ""losing it"".

At her last visit you noted mild cognitive impairment. Today, she appears withdrawn and hesitates to make eye-contact with you. She lets her son do most of the talking. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",E,"The correct answer is E. Ask the son to step out so you can speak with the patient alone.

Before proceeding with any further evaluation or discussion, it's essential to establish a rapport with the patient and assess her ability to provide her own history and make decisions. By asking the son to step out, the doctor can create a safe and non-intimidating environment for the patient to open up and share her concerns, feelings, and experiences. This will help the doctor to better understand the patient's perspective and make a more accurate assessment of her cognitive and emotional state.",Success
"An investigator is studying the effects of different gastrointestinal regulatory substances. A healthy subject is asked to eat a meal at hour 0, and the pH of stomach contents and rate of stomach acid secretions are measured over the next 4 hours. Results of the study are shown. Which of the following mechanisms most likely contributes to the changes seen at point D in the graph?",B,"The correct answer is B. Increased activity of D cells.

At point D in the graph, the pH of the stomach contents increases, and the rate of stomach acid secretion decreases. This suggests that there is an inhibition of gastric acid secretion.

D cells produce somatostatin, a hormone that inhibits the release of gastrin and other gastrointestinal hormones, including histamine and acetylcholine, which stimulate gastric acid secretion. Therefore, increased activity of D cells would lead to a decrease in gastric acid secretion and an increase in pH, as seen at point D.

The other options do not fit with the changes seen at point D:

A. Increased vagal stimulation would increase gastric acid secretion, not decrease it.

C. Increased activation of H2 receptors would increase gastric acid secretion, not decrease it.

D. Increased activity of enterochromaffin-like cells would increase histamine release, which would stimulate gastric acid secretion, not decrease it.

E. Increased activity of I cells would increase cholecystokinin (CCK) release, which would stimulate pancreatic enzyme secretion, but not affect gastric acid secretion.",Success
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician with a lump on her throat that has steadily increased in size over the past 5 months. She does not have difficulties swallowing, dyspnea, or changes in voice. Examination shows a 3-cm, hard swelling on the left side of her neck that moves with swallowing. There is no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Thyroid functions tests are within the reference range. Ultrasound of the neck shows an irregular, hypoechogenic mass in the left lobe of the thyroid. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is inconclusive. The surgeon and patient agree that the most appropriate next step is a diagnostic lobectomy and isthmectomy. Surgery shows a 3.5-cm gray tan thyroid tumor with invasion of surrounding blood vessels, including the veins. The specimen is sent for histopathological examination. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on microscopic examination of the mass?",B,"The correct answer is E. Orphan Annie nuclei.

The symptoms and examination findings, along with the ultrasound and surgical results, suggest a diagnosis of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The invasion of surrounding blood vessels, including veins, is also consistent with this diagnosis. Orphan Annie nuclei, which are characterized by optically clear nuclei with a ground-glass appearance, are a hallmark feature of papillary thyroid carcinoma.",Success
"A 53-year-old female patient comes to the physician’s office for her annual check-up visit. She has no complaints and her past medical history is notable for diabetes and hypertension. During this visit, the patient undergoes screening procedures per guidelines including a mammogram. On the screening mammogram a spiculated, irregular mass is found on the left breast. Further diagnostic mammography and biopsy reveal ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Which of the following is the most important factor in determining this patient’s prognosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Tumor stage.

The prognosis of breast cancer is most closely related to the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis. The stage of breast cancer is determined by the size of the tumor, the involvement of lymph nodes, and the presence of distant metastases. The TNM staging system is commonly used to classify breast cancer into different stages, with stage I being the earliest and most treatable, and stage IV being the most advanced and having the poorest prognosis.

While tumor grade (option A) is also an important factor in determining prognosis, it is not as important as tumor stage. Tumor grade refers to the degree of abnormality of the cancer cells and how quickly they are growing. A higher grade tumor tends to have a poorer prognosis, but it is not as strong a predictor of outcome as tumor stage.

Age (option C) is also a factor in breast cancer prognosis, with older women tend to have a poorer prognosis than younger women. However, it is not as important as tumor stage.

The patient's history of diabetes (option D) is not directly related to her breast cancer prognosis.

The location of the tumor on the breast (option E) is also not a significant factor in determining prognosis. While tumors in certain locations, such as the upper outer quadrant, may be more easily detected and treated, the prognosis is ultimately determined by the stage and characteristics of the tumor itself.",Success
"A 2-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her concerned father. He states that ever since her uncomplicated delivery she has failed to gain weight, has had chronic diarrhea, and has had multiple bacterial and viral infections. During the course of the workup, an absent thymic shadow is noted and a lymph node biopsy demonstrates the absence of germinal centers. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",C,"The correct answer is C. Adenosine deaminase deficiency.

The symptoms described, including failure to gain weight, chronic diarrhea, and recurrent infections, are consistent with a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). The absence of a thymic shadow and the lack of germinal centers in the lymph node biopsy further support this diagnosis.

Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is a type of SCID that is caused by a defect in the ADA gene. This enzyme is necessary for the breakdown of toxic metabolites in lymphocytes, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of these metabolites, which are toxic to lymphocytes. As a result, patients with ADA deficiency have a severe deficiency of both B and T cells, leading to recurrent infections and failure to thrive.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Defect in WASP gene: This would cause Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a condition characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections, but not SCID.

B. Defect in ATM gene: This would cause ataxia-telangiectasia, a condition characterized by cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasias, and recurrent infections, but not SCID.

D. NADPH oxidase deficiency: This would cause chronic granulomatous disease, a condition characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, but not SCID.

She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the breasts shows a secondary mound formed by the nipple and areola. Pubic hair is sparse and lightly pigmented. Abdominal examination shows bilateral firm, nontender inguinal masses. Pelvic examination shows a blind-ended vaginal pouch. Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Gonadectomy.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a condition where a person with a 46,XY karyotype is resistant to the effects of androgens, resulting in a female phenotype. The presence of bilateral inguinal masses, which are likely testes, and the absence of a uterus and ovaries on ultrasonography support this diagnosis.

Gonadectomy, or the removal of the testes, is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition. This is because the testes are at risk of developing malignancy, and removal can reduce this risk. Additionally, gonadectomy can help to reduce the risk of androgen-dependent tumors and can also help to alleviate anxiety and uncertainty related to the presence of testes in a person who identifies as female.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Spironolactone is a medication used to treat hypertension and is not relevant to this patient's condition.

C. Testosterone therapy would not be appropriate for a patient with AIS, as they are resistant to the effects of androgens.

On examination, you notice thinning hair and mildly cool extremities with flattened nail beds. A complete blood count and iron studies are ordered. Which of the following is most likely to show up on her iron profile?",D,"The correct answer is A. Increased iron-binding capacity.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath suggest anemia, which is a common complication of rheumatoid arthritis. The physical examination findings of thinning hair, cool extremities, and flattened nail beds also support this diagnosis.

In iron deficiency anemia, the iron profile would typically show:

* Low ferritin levels (not an option in this case)
* Increased iron-binding capacity (transferrin saturation), as the body tries to increase iron absorption to compensate for the deficiency
* Decreased iron levels (not an option in this case)

Ultrasonography of the abdomen is shown below. During the ultrasound exam, the patient complains of tenderness when the probe presses down on her right upper quadrant. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her pain?",A,"The correct answer is A. Acute calculous cholecystitis.

The patient's symptoms, physical examination, and lab results are consistent with acute calculous cholecystitis. The presence of right upper quadrant tenderness, especially when the probe presses down on the area during ultrasound examination (Murphy's sign), is a classic finding in acute cholecystitis. The ultrasound image shows a gallstone in the gallbladder, which is the likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The elevated white blood cell count and mild elevation of liver enzymes also support this diagnosis.

Acute acalculous cholecystitis (option B) is a less common condition that occurs in the absence of gallstones, often in critically ill patients. Biliary colic (option C) is a condition characterized by intermittent pain due to gallstone movement, but it does not typically present with fever, leukocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes. Acute pancreatitis (option D) is unlikely given the normal serum amylase and lipase levels.

What is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Muellerian agenesis.

Here's why:

* The patient has normal breast development and pubic hair, indicating normal estrogen levels, which is supported by the normal estradiol level.
* The FSH level is within the normal range, which suggests that the ovaries are functioning normally.
* The presence of axillary hair and normal testosterone level rule out androgen insensitivity syndrome.
* The patient's height is relatively short, but it's not a characteristic feature of Turner syndrome, which is typically associated with short stature, webbed neck, and other physical abnormalities.
* The patient's symptoms of mild intermittent lower abdominal pain for the past year suggest a possible anatomical abnormality.
* The patient's refusal to undergo a vaginal examination and the presence of normal hormone levels point towards a structural abnormality, such as Muellerian agenesis, which is a congenital absence of the uterus and vagina.

Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is unlikely given the normal FSH and estradiol levels. Hyperprolactinemia is also unlikely as it would typically cause galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and low estrogen levels, which are not present in this patient.",Success

"A 62-year-old man presents with episodes of palpitations for the past 3 weeks. He says that he has episodes where he feels his heart is ‘racing and pounding’, lasting 1–2 hours on average. Initially, he says the episodes would happen 1–2 times per week but now happen almost every day. This last episode has been constant for the past 2 days. He denies any seizure, loss of consciousness, dizziness, chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is significant for an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, status post intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with still some residual neurologic impairment, and long-standing gastroesophageal reflux secondary to a hiatal hernia, managed medically.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed, which is shown in the exhibit (see image below). Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Begin warfarin and heparin.

The patient's ECG shows atrial fibrillation (AFib) with a rapid ventricular response, which is the cause of his palpitations. Given his history of ischemic stroke, AFib is a significant risk factor for future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). The most appropriate intervention to prevent future CVAs in this patient is to start anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and heparin. Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that takes several days to reach therapeutic levels, so heparin is used as a bridge to prevent thrombus formation until warfarin takes effect.

Aspirin (Option A) is not sufficient for stroke prevention in AFib, and clopidogrel (Option B) is an antiplatelet agent that is not effective for stroke prevention in AFib. Carotid endarterectomy (Option C) is not relevant to this patient's condition, as there is no evidence of carotid artery stenosis.

"In 2005, a group of researchers believed that prophylactically removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) in BRCA-mutation positive women would reduce the chance that they developed breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, they reviewed a database of women who were known to be BRCA-mutation positive and divided the group into those with breast cancer and those without breast cancer. They used data in the registry and surveys about peoples’ surgical history to compare the proportion of each population that had undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Based on this data, they reported that women undergoing the procedure had a lower chance of developing breast cancer later in life with an odds ratio of 0.46. This is an example of what type of study design?",D,"The correct answer is D. Case-control.

This study design is a case-control study because it compares two groups of people: those with breast cancer (cases) and those without breast cancer (controls). The researchers then look back at the history of these individuals to see if they had undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and calculate the odds ratio to determine if there is an association between the procedure and the development of breast cancer.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Retrospective cohort: This type of study would follow a group of people over time to see if they develop a particular outcome. In this study, the outcome (breast cancer) has already occurred, and the researchers are looking back at the history of the individuals to see if they had undergone the procedure.

B. Meta-analysis: This type of study combines the results of multiple studies to draw a conclusion. This study is a single study that analyzed a database of women with BRCA mutations.

C. Cross-sectional: This type of study would examine a group of people at a single point in time to see if there is an association between a particular exposure and an outcome. In this study, the researchers are looking back at the history of the individuals, not examining them at a single point in time.

"A 64-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus is referred to a urologist. The patient has had pain when urinating and difficulty starting a stream of urine for over 4 months now. He is bothered because he has to urinate about 9 times every day, including several times when he wakes up at night. A digital rectal examination revealed multiple hard nodules in the prostate gland. A CT scan shows a nodule in the right lung that measures 3 cm. An ultrasound scan of his urinary bladder and prostate shows residual urine of > 200 mL and heterogeneous findings of the prostate gland. Biopsy reveals grade 2 prostate adenocarcinoma. Follow-up 9 months later shows his prostate cancer is well controlled with goserelin. If one considers pulmonary nodules that are the same size as this patient’s, which of the following additional findings on CT scans would most likely prompt the removal of such nodules?",D,"The correct answer is E. Doubling time of < 1 month.

The presence of a pulmonary nodule in a patient with prostate cancer raises concerns about potential metastasis. The decision to remove a pulmonary nodule depends on various factors, including its size, growth rate, and radiological features.

A doubling time of < 1 month is a strong indicator of malignancy, as it suggests rapid growth. This would prompt the removal of the nodule to determine its nature and prevent further spread of the disease.

The other options are not as concerning:

A. Lamellated calcification is a benign feature, often seen in granulomas.

B. A ""popcorn"" pattern is characteristic of a hamartoma, a benign lung tumor.

C. A subsolid component can be seen in both benign and malignant lesions, but it is not a strong indicator of malignancy.

D. Extending fine striations are often seen in benign lesions, such as a granuloma or a hamartoma.

Therefore, option E is the most likely finding that would prompt the removal of the pulmonary nodule.",Success
"A 35-year-old man presents with a 7 month history of insomnia. The patient admitted to having trouble sleeping from a young age but became more aware of how much this is affecting his health after attending a sleep conference earlier this year. He is worried that his health has suffered because of this, and he is also concerned that he will not be able to pay his bills if he were to get sick. He has no past medical or psychiatric condition and is not known to use any recreational drugs. The patient arrived for his appointment an hour early because he was afraid he might miss it. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals an irritable middle age man who is tense and somewhat inattentive during the interview. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
 ",A,"The correct answer is A. Generalized anxiety disorder.

The patient's symptoms, such as insomnia, excessive worry about his health and finances, and anxiety about being late for his appointment, are consistent with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The patient's physical examination findings, such as being irritable, tense, and inattentive, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's long-standing history of insomnia and worry about his health suggests a chronic anxiety disorder, which is consistent with GAD.

Adjustment disorder (option B) is not the most likely diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms are not in response to a specific stressor or event. Social anxiety disorder (option C) is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are not primarily related to social situations. Agoraphobia (option D) is not supported by the patient's symptoms, as there is no mention of fear or avoidance of specific situations or places. Normal worry (option E) is not a diagnosis, and the patient's symptoms are excessive and interfere with his daily life, indicating a pathological level of anxiety.",Success
A 3-year-old girl is brought to the cardiologist because of sweating and respiratory distress while eating. She is at the 30th percentile for height and 15th percentile for weight. Echocardiography shows a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum and a moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. Physical examination is most likely to show which of the following findings?,A,"The correct answer is C. Systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis.

The symptoms described, such as sweating and respiratory distress while eating, are consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The echocardiography findings of a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum and a moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction also support this diagnosis.

A systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis (Valsalva maneuver) is a characteristic finding in VSD, as it increases the flow of blood through the defect and accentuates the murmur.",Success
"A 58-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath and a nonproductive cough for the last week. Three weeks ago, he had a fever and a cough for 6 days after he returned from a trip to Southeast Asia. He has had a 4-kg (9-lb) weight loss over the past 3 months. He has bronchial asthma and hypertension. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 41 years. Current medications include an albuterol inhaler and enalapril. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 136/89 mm Hg. There is dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and decreased tactile fremitus over the left lung base. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Chest x-ray of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?",E,"The correct answer is E. Blunting of costophrenic angle.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a pleural effusion, which is a collection of fluid in the space between the lungs and chest wall. The dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and decreased tactile fremitus over the left lung base are all consistent with a pleural effusion. The chest x-ray of this patient is most likely to show blunting of the costophrenic angle, which is a characteristic finding in pleural effusions.",Success
"A 58-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of sudden-onset right-sided body numbness for 1 hour. He reports that he has a 15-year history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. He is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. Neurological examination shows decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature on the right side of the face and body. Motor strength is 5/5 and deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Perfusion of which of the following structures of the brain is most likely impaired in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Ventral thalamus.

The patient's symptoms, including right-sided body numbness and decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature on the right side of the face and body, are consistent with a lesion in the ventral thalamus. The ventral thalamus is responsible for relaying sensory information from the body to the cortex, and damage to this area can result in contralateral (opposite side) sensory deficits.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms:

A. Parietal lobe: involved in spatial awareness, attention, and processing of sensory information, but not specifically responsible for contralateral sensory deficits.

B. Posterior limb of the internal capsule: a white matter tract that contains fibers involved in motor and sensory function, but not typically associated with contralateral sensory deficits.

C. Lateral medulla: involved in various functions, including pain and temperature sensation, but not typically associated with contralateral sensory deficits.

D. Basal pons: involved in various functions, including motor control and sensation, but not typically associated with contralateral sensory deficits.",Success
"A 9-year-old boy is brought in by his mother because of bruising on his torso and limbs. The patient’s mother denies any other symptoms and says he is otherwise healthy. Physical examination shows multiple petechiae and bruising on the torso and extremities bilaterally. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A complete blood count is normal. His coagulation profile reveals:
Prothrombin time (PT) 12 sec
Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 60 sec
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is E. Hemophilia A.

The patient's symptoms of bruising and petechiae, along with the abnormal coagulation profile, suggest a bleeding disorder. The normal complete blood count rules out thrombocytopenia, making option C (immune thrombocytopenic purpura) less likely.

The prolonged aPTT (60 sec) suggests a defect in the intrinsic or common coagulation pathway. The normal PT (12 sec) suggests that the extrinsic pathway is intact.

Hemophilia A (classic hemophilia) is a deficiency of factor VIII, which is part of the intrinsic pathway. This would cause a prolonged aPTT, as seen in this patient. Hemophilia B (Christmas disease) is a deficiency of factor IX, which is also part of the intrinsic pathway, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and coagulation profile.

Von Willebrand disease (option D) is a defect in von Willebrand factor, which affects platelet function and the intrinsic pathway. While it could cause a prolonged aPTT, it is less likely given the patient's normal platelet count and the severity of his symptoms.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (option A) is a type of cancer that can cause bleeding due to bone marrow suppression, but it is less likely given the patient's normal complete blood count and coagulation profile.",Success
"A 31-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-week history of a painless lump near the left wrist and tingling pain over his left hand. Physical examination shows a transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist. There is decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand. The tingling pain is aggravated by tapping over the swelling. Which of the following adjacent structures is at risk of entrapment if this mass persists?",C,"The correct answer is D. Flexor carpi radialis tendon.

The symptoms described in the question, such as a painless lump near the wrist, tingling pain over the hand, and decreased sensation in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger, are consistent with a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. The mass is likely a ganglion cyst, which is a common cause of carpal tunnel syndrome.

The flexor carpi radialis tendon is at risk of entrapment if the ganglion cyst persists, as it runs through the carpal tunnel and can be compressed by the cyst.",Success
"A 52-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painless right-sided scrotal swelling. The swelling started several weeks ago but is not always present. Physical examination shows an 8-cm, soft, cystic nontender right-sided scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?",A,"The correct answer is A. Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by tunica vaginalis.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a hydrocele, which is a fluid-filled sac surrounding the testicle. The fact that the mass transilluminates, is soft and cystic, and does not increase in size on coughing suggests that it is a hydrocele. The normal examination of the testis and the absence of bowel sounds in the mass also support this diagnosis.

Hydroceles are caused by an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis, a layer of tissue that surrounds the testicle. This imbalance can lead to the accumulation of fluid in the space between the tunica vaginalis and the testicle, resulting in a hydrocele.

Option B is incorrect because a failure of the processus vaginalis to obliterate would result in a congenital inguinal hernia, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Option C is also incorrect because an extension of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal would result in an inguinal hernia, which would likely be tender and would have bowel sounds. Option D is incorrect because dilation and tortuosity of veins in the pampiniform plexus would result in a varicocele, which is a different condition. Option E is incorrect because primary germ cell neoplasia of the testicle would result in a solid mass, not a fluid-filled sac.",Success

There are no palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses on this extremity, and it is colder and paler in comparison to his left side. Measured compartment pressure of his distal right leg is 35 mm Hg. What is the next best step in this patient's care?",A,"The correct answer is A. Emergent fasciotomy.

The patient's symptoms and signs, including pain, decreased sensation, and inability to move the leg, suggest compartment syndrome, which is a surgical emergency.

"A 43-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after his son found him vomiting bright red blood. He is visibly intoxicated, and hospital records indicate a long history of alcohol substance abuse treated with antabuse (disulfiram). Vital signs include T 98.4, HR 89, BP 154/92, and RR 20. EGD is notable for mild esophagitis, and a longitudinal esophageal tear at the gastroesophageal junction, with no active bleeding. What is the next best course of action?",B,"The correct answer is B. Conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation.

The patient has a longitudinal esophageal tear at the gastroesophageal junction, but there is no active bleeding. Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse and the presence of mild esophagitis, it is likely that the tear is related to vomiting and retching. In the absence of active bleeding, conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation is the next best course of action. This approach allows for close monitoring of the patient's condition and can help prevent further complications.

The other options are not appropriate in this scenario:

A. Cyanoacrylate injection and ligation with banding are typically used to treat bleeding varices, which is not the case here.

C. Barium swallow is not necessary to characterize the depth of mucosal involvement, as the EGD has already provided a clear diagnosis.

D. Esophageal manometry and impedance studies are not relevant to the management of an esophageal tear.

E. Calcium channel blockage and Botox injection of the lower esophageal sphincter are treatments for achalasia, which is not the diagnosis in this case.",Success
A medical student is preparing a patient for an appendectomy. He is asked by the surgeon to disinfect the patient’s skin with a chlorhexidine-isopropyl alcohol solution before the procedure. Recent studies have shown that this solution substantially reduces the risk of surgical site infections compared with a povidone-iodine preparation without alcohol in clean-contaminated surgery. Which of the following mechanisms best describes the mechanism of action of chlorhexidine?,E,"The correct answer is B. Protein coagulation/denaturation.

Chlorhexidine is a bisbiguanide antiseptic that works by disrupting the bacterial cell membrane, leading to protein coagulation and denaturation. This ultimately causes the death of the bacterial cell. Chlorhexidine is effective against a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Its mechanism of action is distinct from other antiseptics, such as povidone-iodine, which works by releasing iodine that attacks bacterial cell walls and nucleic acids.",Success

Physical exam of the infant is unremarkable. The mother has a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and is curious about the development of her daughter's ovaries. Which of the following is true regarding the baby’s reproductive system at this time?",B,"The correct answer is B. The baby’s oocytes are arrested in prophase.

At birth, a female infant's ovaries contain approximately 1-2 million oocytes, which are arrested in prophase I of meiosis. This means that the oocytes have begun the process of meiosis, but have not yet completed it.

"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-week history of burning sensation in his mouth. One year ago, a peripheral blood smear performed during workup of fatigue revealed erythrocytes without central pallor. His father had gallstones, for which he underwent a cholecystectomy at the age of 26 years. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes, mild scleral icterus, a swollen, red tongue, and several mouth ulcers. There is darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles. His spleen is enlarged and palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.1 gm/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 104 μm3, and a reticulocyte count of 9%. Which of the following would most likely have prevented this patient's oropharyngeal symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is E. Folic acid supplementation.

The patient's symptoms, including a burning sensation in the mouth, mouth ulcers, and a swollen, red tongue, are consistent with a folate deficiency. The patient's medical history, including a peripheral blood smear showing erythrocytes without central pallor, suggests that the patient has a congenital disorder affecting hemoglobin synthesis, likely beta-thalassemia. The patient's father's history of gallstones at a young age also supports this diagnosis, as beta-thalassemia can lead to increased hemolysis and bilirubin production, causing gallstones.

Folic acid supplementation would have helped to prevent the patient's oropharyngeal symptoms, which are related to the folate deficiency. The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or underlying condition.",Success
An experimental new drug in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 was found to increase the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation at the endothelium. This further increased glucose-dependent insulin production. Which of the following drugs has a mechanism of action most similar to this new experimental drug?,B,"The correct answer is B. Sitagliptin.

The experimental drug described in the question prevents the degradation of incretins at the endothelium, which increases glucose-dependent insulin production. This is similar to the mechanism of action of sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. DPP-4 is an enzyme that breaks down incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). By inhibiting DPP-4, sitagliptin increases the levels of active incretins, which in turn stimulate insulin secretion and improve glucose control.

Exenatide (A) is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, which works by mimicking the action of GLP-1, but it does not prevent its degradation.

Glimepiride (C) is a sulfonylurea that stimulates insulin secretion by binding to the sulfonylurea receptor on pancreatic beta cells.

Canagliflozin (D) is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which works by increasing urinary glucose excretion.

"A 60-year-old man with severe persistent asthma since the age of 14 presents with an acute exacerbation of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing over the last several days. His asthmatic symptoms are usually well controlled with regular high-dose inhaled triamcinolone, but over the last week or so he has developed a nocturnal cough and mild wheezing despite good compliance with controller medications. A review of several spirometry reports suggest of bronchial asthma with a partial irreversible airway obstruction. Which of the following is most likely to be associated with the recent loss of asthma control in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Airway remodeling.

The patient's history of severe persistent asthma since childhood, partial irreversible airway obstruction, and recent loss of asthma control despite good compliance with controller medications suggest that airway remodeling may be contributing to the recent exacerbation. Airway remodeling refers to the structural changes that occur in the airways over time, including fibrosis, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and epithelial thickening, which can lead to irreversible airflow obstruction. This is a common feature of severe asthma and can contribute to loss of asthma control.

Airway epithelial shedding (A) is a feature of acute asthma exacerbations, but it is not the most likely explanation for the patient's recent loss of asthma control. Airway smooth muscle atrophy (B) is not a typical feature of asthma. Airway inflammation (D) is a key component of asthma, but it is not the most likely explanation for the patient's recent loss of asthma control, given that they have been taking high-dose inhaled corticosteroids.

A photomicrograph of a section of the lung obtained during the autopsy is shown. Which of the following mediators is most likely responsible for the presence of the cell-type indicated by the arrow?",B,"The correct answer is C. Interferon-gamma.

The photomicrograph shows a section of lung tissue with an inflammatory infiltrate, and the arrow is pointing to a neutrophil. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that is typically recruited to sites of bacterial infection, such as in this case with Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is a cytokine that plays a key role in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils in response to bacterial infections. It is produced by immune cells such as T cells and natural killer cells, and it stimulates the production of chemokines and adhesion molecules that attract neutrophils to the site of infection.

The other options are not directly related to the recruitment of neutrophils:

A biopsy is obtained showing diffuse cellular hyperplasia with areas of focal colloid hyperplasia. Given these findings, the patient is started on appropriate therapy, and the neck mass becomes smaller over time. Which of the following is most likely associated with the cause of this patient's symptoms?",C,"The correct answer is A. HLA-B8 risk factor.

The patient's symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism. The presence of a painful, diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with small nodules, along with symptoms of fatigue and cold intolerance, suggests Graves' disease.

Prothrombin Time 14 sec
Partial Thromboplastin Time 90 sec
Mixing study (PTT) 89 sec
What is the most likely cause of the patient’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Antibodies directed against phospholipids.

The patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus and spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks gestation suggests the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, which are a common feature of antiphospholipid syndrome. The laboratory results, particularly the prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) that does not correct with a mixing study, are consistent with the presence of a lupus anticoagulant, which is a type of antiphospholipid antibody. The patient's symptoms and Doppler ultrasound results are consistent with deep vein thrombosis, which is a common complication of antiphospholipid syndrome.

Antibodies directed against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (Option A) are associated with immune thrombocytopenia, not thrombosis. Antibodies directed against endothelial cells (Option C) are not a well-defined entity and are not typically associated with thrombosis.

She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from “random” bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, “Yes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.” She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/70 mm Hg, pulse 66/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base. There are also branched radiodensities that the radiologist notes as being “glove-finger shadows” (noted by the arrow in the image). Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are elevated. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Prednisone.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including worsening shortness of breath, coughing and wheezing episodes, fever, malaise, and expectoration of brown mucous plugs, are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). The chest radiograph showing atelectasis in the right lung base and ""glove-finger shadows"" (also known as ""tree-in-bud"" opacities) is also characteristic of CF. The elevated serum IgE levels support this diagnosis.

Prednisone is a corticosteroid that is often used to treat CF exacerbations, as it can help reduce inflammation and improve lung function. While antibiotics may also be necessary to treat bacterial infections, prednisone is the most appropriate initial therapy to address the patient's respiratory symptoms and inflammation.

The other options are not directly related to the treatment of CF:

A. Isoniazid is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis.

B. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections.

C. Caspofungin is an antifungal medication used to treat invasive fungal infections.

E. Surgical resection of the infiltrates is not a primary treatment for CF and may not be necessary in this case.",Success
"A 30-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with complaints of fever (41.5℃ (106.7℉)) and diarrhea for the past 12 hours. There is no history of headaches, vomiting, or loss of consciousness. The past medical history is unobtainable due to a language barrier (the patient recently immigrated from abroad), but his wife says her husband had a motor vehicle accident when he was a teenager that required surgery. He is transferred to the ICU after a few hours in the ED because of dyspnea, cyanosis, and near-collapse. There are no signs of a meningeal infection. The Blood pressure was 70/30 mm Hg at the time of transfer. A chest X-ray at the time of admission showed interstitial infiltrates without homogeneous opacities. The initial laboratory results reveal metabolic acidosis, leukopenia with a count of 2,000/mm³, thrombocytopenia (15,000/mm³), and a coagulation profile suggestive of disseminated coagulation. A peripheral smear was performed and is shown below. Despite ventilatory support, administration of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressor agents, the patient died the next day. A gram stain from an autopsy specimen of the lungs revealed gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains. Which of the following organisms is most likely?",C,"The correct answer is C. Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The peripheral smear shows red blood cells with multiple small, ring-shaped structures, which are consistent with spherocytes. This, combined with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, suggests a diagnosis of pneumococcal sepsis. The gram stain from the autopsy specimen showing gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains is also consistent with Streptococcus pneumoniae.",Success
"A 12-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department 3 hours after the sudden onset of colicky abdominal pain and vomiting. The patient also manifests symptoms of redness and swelling of the face and lips without pruritus. Her symptoms began following a tooth extraction earlier in the morning. She had a similar episode of facial swelling after a bicycle accident 1 year ago, which resolved within 48 hours without treatment. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a nontender facial edema, erythema of the oral mucosa, and an enlarged tongue. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation over the lower quadrants. An abdominal ultrasound shows segmental thickening of the intestinal wall. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Complement inhibitor deficiency.

The patient's symptoms, including recurrent episodes of facial swelling, abdominal pain, and intestinal wall thickening, are consistent with hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of C1 inhibitor, a protein that regulates the complement system. The lack of pruritus and the presence of abdominal symptoms also support this diagnosis.",Success
"A healthy 21-year-old man undergoes physical fitness testing prior to long-term submarine deployment. To evaluate his pulmonary function, lung and thoracic compliance are measured at different system pressures. A graph of the relationship between his lung volume and transpulmonary pressure is shown.

The dotted line in the graph represents the maximum lung volume that can be achieved with maximum inspiratory effort, which is the definition of vital capacity.",Success
"A 3-day-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a 4-hour history of somnolence, poor feeding, and one episode of vomiting. He is exclusively breastfed. His serum glucose concentration is 88 mg/dL and his serum ammonia concentration is 850 μmol/L (N<90). Urinalysis shows an increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio. Urinary ketones are absent. This patient is most likely deficient in an enzyme that catalyzes which of the following reactions?",A,"The correct answer is A. Ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a deficiency in the urea cycle, specifically ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. The elevated serum ammonia level, increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio in the urine, and absence of urinary ketones support this diagnosis.

OTC is an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction between ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to form citrulline, which is a critical step in the urea cycle. Deficiency in this enzyme leads to the accumulation of ammonia and orotic acid, causing the observed symptoms and laboratory results.",Success
"A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dragging pelvic pain and a 3 kg (6 lb 9 oz) weight loss over the past 6 months. Menses occur at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals; her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate is 102/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Physical examination shows hyperreflexia. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass. This adnexal mass is most likely derived from which of the following cell types?",B,"The correct answer is D. Endometrial cells.

The symptoms described, such as pelvic pain, irregular menses, and a hypoechoic adnexal mass, are consistent with an endometrioma, which is a type of ovarian cyst that forms when endometrial tissue grows outside the uterus. Endometrial cells are the most likely origin of this adnexal mass.",Success
"A 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department with the complaint of pain in his right toe for the past hour. The pain is so severe that it woke him up. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 40 years and binge drinks alcohol after work and on the weekends. He underwent an appendectomy when he was 14 years old. He is a long-distance truck driver. Neither of his parents had any significant medical history. His temperature is 37.7°C (100°F), blood pressure is 135/75 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, respiratory rate is 20/min, and BMI is 25 kg/m2. On examination, his right first metatarsophalangeal joint is very tender, swollen, warm, and red in color. Range of motion cannot be assessed due to extreme tenderness.
Laboratory test
Complete blood count:
Hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL
Leukocytes 16,000/mm3
Platelets 150,000/mm3
ESR 50 mm/hr
Synovial fluid is aspirated from the joint. The findings are:
Appearance Cloudy, dense yellow
WBC 30,000 cells/µL
Culture Negative
Needle-shaped birefringent crystals are observed in the joint aspirate. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is C. Lysis of large numbers of cells.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with acute gouty arthritis, which is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints. The presence of needle-shaped birefringent crystals in the joint aspirate is diagnostic of gout.

The most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition is the lysis of large numbers of cells, which releases nucleic acids that are then metabolized to uric acid. This can occur in individuals who have a high cell turnover rate, such as those with chronic myeloproliferative disorders or those undergoing chemotherapy. In this patient, the long history of smoking and binge drinking may have contributed to his increased cell turnover rate, leading to an increased production of uric acid and ultimately, the development of gout.",Success
"A 33-year-old man presents to the infectious diseases clinic for follow-up. He was recently admitted to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and cough, and was found to have Pneumocystic jirovecii pneumonia and a new diagnosis of HIV. His CD4 count is 175, viral load is pending. As part of routine laboratory studies given his new diagnosis, an RPR was found to be positive with a titer of 1:64, and this is confirmed with a positive FTA-ABS. He is unsure when or how he acquired HIV or syphilis. His neurological examination is normal, and he has no symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management:",C,"The correct answer is C. Treat with three weekly injections of penicillin, obtain titers in 6 months.

The patient has a positive RPR and FTA-ABS, indicating a diagnosis of syphilis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that patients with HIV and syphilis be treated with a regimen that is effective for neurosyphilis, even if they do not have neurological symptoms. This is because HIV-infected individuals are at increased risk of developing neurosyphilis.

The recommended treatment for neurosyphilis is three weekly injections of benzathine penicillin G, 2.4 million units IM. This is because the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration of penicillin is improved with multiple doses.

Option A is incorrect because a lumbar puncture is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have neurological symptoms. Options B, D, and E are incorrect because they do not provide the recommended treatment regimen for neurosyphilis in an HIV-infected individual.",Success
"A 67-year old man presents to his primary care physician for his yearly checkup. He has not noticed any major changes in his health over the last year but says that unfortunately, he stopped exercising because he has been stressed by work. His past medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipidemia. He is taking a number of drugs but does not remember what they are. A panel of metabolic and lipid tests are ordered and show worsening of his metabolic parameters. Based on these findings, his physician prescribes a drug that leads to a large decrease in triglycerides with a much smaller increase in high-density lipoproteins and decrease in low-density lipoproteins. The drug that was most likely prescribed in this case is associated with which of the following side effects?",B,"The correct answer is B. Cholelithiasis.

The patient's metabolic and lipid test results suggest that the prescribed drug is a fibrate, which is a class of medications that effectively lower triglycerides and increase HDL cholesterol, with a smaller effect on LDL cholesterol. Fibrates are commonly used to treat hypertriglyceridemia and are often prescribed for patients with diabetes and hyperlipidemia.

One of the known side effects of fibrates is an increased risk of cholelithiasis (gallstones). This is because fibrates can increase the concentration of cholesterol in bile, making it more likely to form gallstones.

Acanthosis nigricans (A) is a skin condition associated with insulin resistance, not a side effect of fibrates. Decreased vitamin D absorption (C) is a side effect of some medications, but not typically associated with fibrates. Hepatotoxicity (D) is a potential side effect of some medications, but not a common side effect of fibrates. Teratogenicity (E) is a concern with some medications, but not typically associated with fibrates.",Success
"A 29-year-old woman presents to her OB/GYN for a preconception visit. She wishes to become pregnant within the next several months. A thorough history reveals that the patient suffers from phenylketonuria (PKU). She recalls being instructed by prior physicians to follow a diet that avoids certain foods; however, she admits to not being complaint with these recommendations. Laboratory testing reveals a plasma phenylalanine level of 20.2 mg/dL (normal range <2 mg/dL). Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. 3 months prior to conception, begin a restricted diet to lower phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL.

Women with phenylketonuria (PKU) who become pregnant have a higher risk of having a child with intellectual disability, microcephaly, and congenital heart defects if their phenylalanine levels are not well controlled during pregnancy. To minimize these risks, it is recommended that women with PKU follow a phenylalanine-restricted diet before conception and throughout pregnancy. The goal is to lower phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL, which is considered safe for fetal development. This should be done at least 3 months prior to conception to ensure that the levels are under control before pregnancy.",Success
"A 47-year-old man presents to his family physician with a sudden onset of severe pain and redness in his eyes that started this morning. He is having difficulty seeing properly and is extremely worried about losing his vision. Further history reveals that he has had progressive lower back pain for over 2 months now. The pain is usually at its worst in the morning, but it remains throughout the day. It gets better with movement, however, so he tends to do some light exercises every day. He also has heel pain and feels significant pressure while walking. Laboratory analysis reveals increased ESR and CRP serum levels. Which of the following would most likely be seen in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Aortic regurgitation.

The patient's symptoms, including sudden onset of severe eye pain and redness, difficulty seeing, and a history of progressive lower back pain, heel pain, and morning stiffness, are consistent with a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). AS is a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects the spine and can cause eye inflammation (uveitis).

The laboratory results showing increased ESR and CRP serum levels support this diagnosis, as they indicate inflammation.

Aortic regurgitation is a known complication of ankylosing spondylitis, and it is likely to be seen in this patient. The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and diagnosis.",Success
"A 38-year-old woman presents to her physician’s clinic for recurrent episodes of chest pain that wakes her from her sleep. While usually occurring late at night, she has also had similar pains during the day at random times, most recently while sitting at her desk in her office and at other times while doing the dishes at home. The pain lasts 10–15 minutes and resolves spontaneously. She is unable to identify any common preceding event to pain onset. The remainder of her history is unremarkable and she takes no regular medications. She works as an accountant. There is no history of smoking or drug use, however, she does consume 5 alcoholic drinks per week. Examination reveals: pulse 70/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg. A physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following would be effective in reducing her symptoms?",C,"The correct answer is C. Isosorbide dinitrate.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with angina pectoris, specifically variant angina, which is caused by coronary artery spasm. The fact that the pain occurs at rest, wakes her up at night, and is not triggered by exertion suggests that it is not typical angina pectoris caused by atherosclerosis.

Isosorbide dinitrate is a nitrate medication that is effective in reducing the frequency and severity of angina attacks by dilating the coronary arteries and reducing vasospasm. It is commonly used to treat variant angina.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that is used to prevent thrombotic events, but it is not effective in reducing symptoms of angina.

B. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that is used to treat atrial fibrillation and heart failure, but it is not indicated for angina.

The tonsils are not notably enlarged. Laboratory work-up shows an elevated lymphocyte count, atypical lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear, and a positive heterophile antibody screen. Which of the following is the best management of this patient's condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Bed rest and activity limitation.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with infectious mononucleosis (IM), a viral infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The presence of splenomegaly, tonsillar exudate, and posterior auricular lymphadenopathy, along with an elevated lymphocyte count, atypical lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear, and a positive heterophile antibody screen, support this diagnosis.

The management of IM is primarily supportive, and the best option is A. Bed rest and activity limitation. Patients with IM should avoid strenuous activities, especially contact sports, to reduce the risk of splenic rupture. They should also get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and take over-the-counter pain relievers to manage symptoms.

The other options are not correct because:

Hemoglobin A1C 10.5%
Urine
Osmolality 400 mOsm/kg
Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""",B,"The correct answer is C. Gastrointestinal fluid loss.

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness when standing up suggest dehydration.
* The physical examination findings of whitening of the tongue and skin that takes 5 seconds to retract after pinching on the back of the hand are also consistent with dehydration.
* The laboratory studies show a serum sodium level of 150 mEq/L, which is slightly low, and a serum osmolality of 354 mOsm/kg, which is also slightly low. This suggests that the patient has a hypotonic dehydration.
* The urine osmolality of 400 mOsm/kg is relatively high, which suggests that the kidneys are trying to conserve water.
* The patient's medication, hydrochlorothiazide, can cause dehydration, but it would not typically cause a hypotonic dehydration.
* Osmotic diuresis (option B) would cause a high serum osmolality, not a low one.
* Diuretic overdose (option A) would cause a high urine output, but the patient's urine osmolality is high, suggesting that the kidneys are conserving water.
* Excess production of aldosterone (option D) would cause hypertension and hypokalemia, but the patient's blood pressure is low, and his potassium level is normal.
* Insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone (option E) would cause diabetes insipidus, which would result in a high serum osmolality and a low urine osmolality, the opposite of what is seen in this patient.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for these findings is gastrointestinal fluid loss due to the patient's nausea and vomiting, leading to dehydration.",Success
"A 38-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for her yearly exam. Her only complaint is difficulty losing weight. Her BMI is 34 kg/m^2. In addition to a standard physical exam, the physician orders a glucose tolerance test. The woman's fasting blood glucose level is 120 mg/dL and two-hour post 75g glucose load blood glucose level is 190 mg/dL. The physician informs the patient that she is ""pre-diabetic"" or at risk of developing diabetes and recommends lifestyle modification with follow-up in 6 months. Which of the following endogenous signaling molecules or receptors will increase insulin sensitivity in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a nuclear receptor that plays a key role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. Activation of PPARγ increases insulin sensitivity, which is beneficial for individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. Thiazolidinediones, a class of antidiabetic medications, work by activating PPARγ, leading to increased insulin sensitivity and improved glucose uptake in adipose tissue and muscle.

The other options are incorrect because:

A. Catecholamines (such as epinephrine and norepinephrine) decrease insulin sensitivity and increase glucose release from storage sites.

B. Glucagon raises blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and decreases insulin sensitivity.

C. Glucocorticoids (such as cortisol) decrease insulin sensitivity and increase glucose release from storage sites.

Extraocular movements are intact. Mild ptosis is noted bilaterally but worse on the left. A visual acuity test reveals no abnormalities. Which of the following medications is most appropriate in the management of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Pyridostigmine.

The patient's symptoms, including double vision, worsening fatigue, and bilateral ptosis, are consistent with myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction. Pyridostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that is commonly used to treat MG by increasing the amount of acetylcholine available at the neuromuscular junction, thereby improving muscle strength and reducing symptoms.

Physostigmine (option B) is also a cholinesterase inhibitor, but it is not typically used to treat MG.

Edrophonium (option C) is a short-acting cholinesterase inhibitor that is sometimes used to diagnose MG, but it is not used for long-term management.

"Accurate and rapid identification of individuals with tuberculosis (TB) is crucial to accomplishing the goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to eliminate this disease. One of the key strategies for the detection of TB is the use of tuberculin skin testing as a globally pertinent screening method, due to its low cost and technical simplicity. A study from Brazil demonstrated 76.7% accuracy, 67.9% sensitivity, 84.4% specificity, 79.1% positive predictive value, and 75% negative predictive value when using 5-mm skin elevation as a threshold, or cut-off, point for the screening test (following intradermal injection). Lowering the cut-off point to 4 mm would also result in an increase in which test property?",D,"The correct answer is D. Negative predictive value.

Lowering the cut-off point from 5 mm to 4 mm would increase the number of true negatives (people who do not have TB and test negative) and decrease the number of false negatives (people who have TB but test negative). This would result in an increase in the negative predictive value, which is the proportion of people who test negative and do not have the disease.

The other options are not correct:

A. Convergent validity refers to the extent to which different measures of the same concept are correlated. It is not directly related to the cut-off point of a test.

B. Discriminant validity refers to the ability of a test to distinguish between people with and without a disease. While lowering the cut-off point may affect the test's ability to discriminate between people with and without TB, it would not directly increase discriminant validity.

C. Positive predictive value is the proportion of people who test positive and actually have the disease. Lowering the cut-off point would likely decrease the positive predictive value, as more people without TB would test positive.

E. Test specificity is the proportion of people without TB who test negative. Lowering the cut-off point would likely decrease test specificity, as more people without TB would test positive.",Success

"A one-week-old, full-term infant born by uncomplicated vaginal delivery is brought to a pediatrician by his mother, who notes that her daughter's skin appears yellow. She reports that the child cries several times per day and sleeps 7-8 hours at night, uninterrupted. She has been breastfeeding exclusively and feels that he has been feeding well. Which of the following is the best treatment for this condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Continue normal breast feeding.

The symptoms described, such as jaundice (yellow skin) in a one-week-old full-term infant who is breastfeeding well and has a normal sleep pattern, are consistent with physiologic jaundice, a common and benign condition in newborns. Physiologic jaundice is caused by the breakdown of fetal hemoglobin and is usually treated with continued breastfeeding and monitoring. In this case, the infant is feeding well and has a normal sleep pattern, which suggests that the jaundice is not causing any significant distress.

The other options are not appropriate treatments for physiologic jaundice:

A. Phototherapy is used to treat pathologic jaundice, which is a more severe condition that requires medical intervention.

B. Phenobarbital administration is not a treatment for jaundice in newborns.

C. Plasma exchange is a treatment for severe cases of jaundice, but it is not necessary for physiologic jaundice.

D. Switching from breast milk to formula is not necessary and may even exacerbate the condition, as breast milk helps to promote the excretion of bilirubin, the pigment responsible for jaundice.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman arrives to the clinic complaining of progressive urinary leakage that has occurred for the past 1 year. At first, she would notice leakage only during athletic exercise, but now the incontinence occurs even when she laughs or coughs. The patient states that she goes to the bathroom more frequently to try to prevent “wetting myself.” She wakes up once a night to urinate. She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she “needs to focus.” The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use. Pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable. When that patient is asked to Valsalva, leakage of urine is observed. A urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Urethral hypermobility.

The patient's symptoms of urinary leakage that progresses from occurring only during athletic exercise to occurring with laughing or coughing, and the observation of urine leakage during Valsalva maneuver, suggest stress urinary incontinence (SUI). SUI is often caused by urethral hypermobility, which is a weakening of the pelvic floor muscles and connective tissue that support the urethra. This can occur due to childbirth, surgery, or other factors.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and examination:

A. Diabetic polyuria would cause frequent urination and polyuria, but not specifically stress incontinence.

B. Overactive detrusor muscle would cause urinary frequency, urgency, and possibly incontinence, but not specifically stress incontinence.

C. Primary polydipsia would cause excessive thirst and urination, but not specifically stress incontinence.

E. Vescicovaginal fistula would cause continuous urinary incontinence, not stress incontinence triggered by specific activities.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after an episode of altered mental status. She was at a party when she suddenly fell to the floor. Her friends state that she was not responsive and was acting oddly. After the episode, the patient seemed confused and had no memory of the event. The patient has a past medical history of substance abuse, depression, and anxiety. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 117/69 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals a girl who seems confused and responds to questions slowly. Her gait is stable, and she demonstrates 5/5 strength in her upper and lower extremities. Laboratory values and a urine dipstick test are performed as seen below:

Toxicology:
Benzodiazepines: Positive
Marijuana: Positive
Cocaine: Negative
Phencyclidine: Negative

Urine Dipstick:
Appearance: Dark
Red blood cells: Positive
Glucose: Negative

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. IV fluids and mannitol.

The patient's presentation, including altered mental status, confusion, and a positive urine dipstick for red blood cells, suggests a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, which is a condition characterized by muscle breakdown and release of muscle enzymes into the bloodstream. The dark appearance of the urine also supports this diagnosis.

The presence of benzodiazepines and marijuana in the toxicology screen may have contributed to the patient's altered mental status, but they do not explain the red blood cells in the urine.

The best next step in management is to administer IV fluids and mannitol to help flush out the muscle enzymes and prevent kidney damage. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that can help increase urine production and reduce the risk of kidney injury.

Diazepam (A) may be used to treat seizures or anxiety, but it is not the best next step in this scenario. Electroencephalography (B) may be useful in evaluating the patient's altered mental status, but it is not the most urgent priority. Phenytoin (D) is an anticonvulsant that may be used to treat seizures, but it is not indicated in this scenario. Supportive therapy and observation (E) may be necessary, but they are not the most important next step in managing the patient's rhabdomyolysis.",Success
"A 47-year-old woman presents to a physician for evaluation of vomiting and diarrhea for 2 days. Her symptoms began following a company picnic a few days ago. Initially, she was unable to tolerate any solids or liquids by mouth, but now has been able to drink sips of water. She had a mild headache, which was relieved with acetaminophen. The past medical history is unremarkable. She does not take any medications. The blood pressure is 120/60 mm Hg and the heart rate is 60/min. On examination, the mucous membranes are dry and the eyes are slightly sunken. Where is most of the sodium reabsorbed in this patient’s kidneys?",D,"The correct answer is D. Proximal tubule.

In this patient, the kidneys are trying to conserve sodium and water due to dehydration caused by vomiting and diarrhea. The proximal tubule is the site where most of the sodium reabsorption occurs, with approximately 60-70% of the filtered sodium being reabsorbed in this segment. This is an important mechanism to conserve sodium and water in the body.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Collecting duct: This is the site where fine-tuning of sodium reabsorption occurs, but it is not the primary site of sodium reabsorption.

B. Distal tubule: This segment is involved in the regulation of sodium reabsorption, but it is not the primary site.

C. Descending limb of loop of Henle: This segment is involved in the concentration of urine, but it is not a site of significant sodium reabsorption.

E. Ascending limb of loop of Henle: This segment is involved in the dilution of urine, but it is not a site of significant sodium reabsorption.",Success
"A one-week-old boy presents with yellow sclerae, severe lethargy, and decreased muscle tone. His mother notes that the symptoms started shortly after birth and have been progressively worsening. The patient is breast fed and takes no medications. His labs are within normal limits with the exception of his liver function tests as follows:

ALT: 8 U/ L
AST: 10 U/L
Alkaline phosphatase: 50 U/L
Albumin: 3.7 g/dL
Total protein: 6.7 g/dL
Bilirubin, total: 29.4 mg/dL
Bilirubin, unconjugated: 29.2 mg/dL
Bilirubin, conjugated: 0.2 mg/dL

The boy is taken immediately for treatment. What is the most likely underlying cause of his condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Absence of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1.

The patient's lab results show a significant elevation in total bilirubin, with almost all of it being unconjugated bilirubin. This suggests a defect in the conjugation of bilirubin, which is a process that occurs in the liver and involves the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1. The absence of this enzyme would lead to a buildup of unconjugated bilirubin, causing the symptoms seen in this patient.

Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I is a rare genetic disorder caused by the complete absence of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1, which leads to severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The other options are not consistent with the lab results and symptoms presented.",Success

C. The tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea is approximately 1.0 throughout the proximal convoluted tubule.

This is because the graph shows that the concentration of urea in the tubular fluid is roughly equal to the concentration in the plasma at all points along the proximal convoluted tubule, resulting in a ratio of approximately 1.0.",Success
"A 62-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of right-sided back pain, nausea, and dark urine. He reports alternating episodes of decreased urine output followed by a temporary increase in urine output for the past 2 days. In the past year, he has had two urinary tract infections. He has Crohn disease and underwent a small bowel resection 5 years ago. He currently takes mesalamine and a multivitamin. His father had recurrent kidney stones. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows right costovertebral angle tenderness. Urinalysis shows 70 RBC/hpf and envelope-shaped crystals. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a 6-mm stone in the proximal right ureter and two 4-mm stones in the left kidney. Which of the following factors has most likely contributed most to this patient’s current condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Malabsorption of fatty acids.

The patient's history of Crohn disease and small bowel resection suggests malabsorption of fatty acids, which can lead to an increased risk of oxalate kidney stones. The presence of envelope-shaped crystals in the urinalysis is consistent with oxalate stones. The patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are also consistent with kidney stones.

While parathyroid gland adenoma (Option A) can cause hypercalcemia, which can increase the risk of kidney stones, it is less likely to be the primary contributor to this patient's condition given the history of Crohn disease and malabsorption.

Excess vitamin D (Option B) can also increase the risk of kidney stones, but it is not as strongly associated with oxalate stones as malabsorption of fatty acids.

Recurrent urinary tract infections (Option C) may increase the risk of kidney stones, but they are not the primary cause of oxalate stones.

High urine pH (Option E) is not typically associated with oxalate stones, which are more commonly associated with acidic urine.",Success

"A 29-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain for 2 hours. Her current pregnancy was achieved by means of in vitro fertilization due to azoospermia in her partner. Prenatal course has been uncomplicated with regular prenatal visits. After a period of having avoided sexual intercourse during her early pregnancy, she resumed sexual activity with her partner at week 22 of gestation. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate; her other child was delivered vaginally. She has had abnormal Pap smears due to HPV in the past. Her pulse is 82/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, the uterus is consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is in a cephalic presentation. There are traces of blood on the vulva and the introitus. Speculum examination shows a tender, bruised cervix, with a closed cervical os. Fetal heart rate is 166/min and CTG shows a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall. What is the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding?",C,"The correct answer is C. Cervical trauma.

The patient's symptoms of vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain, along with the physical examination findings of a tender, bruised cervix, suggest that the bleeding is likely due to cervical trauma. The fact that she resumed sexual activity at 22 weeks' gestation and has a closed cervical os makes cervical trauma a more likely cause than other options.",Success
"A 16-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency room with acute vomiting and abdominal pain that began earlier today. His parents say that the boy was doing well until two days ago when he told them that he was feeling unwell.

  pH: 7.21
  pCO2: 32 mm HG
  HCO 3-: 15.2 mEq/L
Sodium: 122 mEq/L
Potassium: 5.8 mEq/L
Urinalysis is positive for ketone bodies. What is the most appropriate immediate step in the management of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Administer IV fluids and insulin.

The patient is presenting with symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of diabetes. The diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of stopping insulin, high blood glucose level, and presence of ketone bodies in the urine. The patient's lab results also show a metabolic acidosis with a low pH, low bicarbonate level, and high anion gap.

The immediate management of DKA involves administering IV fluids to correct dehydration and insulin to lower blood glucose levels. IV fluids help to replenish lost fluids, electrolytes, and reduce blood glucose levels. Insulin administration helps to reduce glucose production in the liver and increase glucose uptake in the peripheral tissues.

The other options are not correct because:

B. IV antibiotics are not indicated in the management of DKA.

C. Oral antidiabetic medications are not effective in the management of DKA, and IV fluids are necessary to correct dehydration.

D. IV bicarbonate is not recommended in the management of DKA unless the patient's pH is very low (<6.9).

E. While potassium and magnesium levels may need to be monitored and replaced, they are not the most immediate step in the management of DKA.",Success
"A 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department with chest pain. He reports that one hour ago he was climbing the stairs in his home when he suddenly developed excruciating chest pain. He describes the pain as ripping and radiating to the back. The patient’s past medical history is significant for a heart murmur that is being followed by his outpatient cardiologist. He takes no medications. The patient works as a carpenter and reports being monogamous with his wife. He denies any history of intravenous drug use or recent travel. In the emergency department, the patient’s temperature is 99.4°F (37.4°C), blood pressure is 94/56 mmHg, pulse is 121/min, and respirations are 14/min. On physical exam, the patient appears to be in moderate distress and is clutching his chest. He is tall and has joint hypermobility. His breath sounds are equal and full bilaterally and has weak distal pulses.

Which of the following is most likely to be found in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is A. Holosystolic, high-pitched blowing murmur at the lower left sternal border.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with an aortic dissection, which is a tear in the lining of the aorta. The patient's history of a heart murmur, tall stature, and joint hypermobility suggest that he may have Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder that can increase the risk of aortic dissection.

They try to ask her what is wrong, but she does not respond and persists crying for approximately 20 minutes, after which she goes back to sleeping comfortably. Upon awaking the following morning, she has no recollection of the night's events. Which of the following is true about these episodes?",B,"The correct answer is B. They occur only during non-REM sleep.

The symptoms described in the question are consistent with night terrors, also known as sleep terrors. Night terrors are a type of parasomnia that occurs during deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, usually in the first third of the night. They are characterized by sudden episodes of screaming, crying, and thrashing, often accompanied by a sense of fear or panic. The child is usually unresponsive to attempts to comfort them and may not remember the episode in the morning.

"An 18-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a pruritic rash on her back for the past 2 hours. This morning, she started a course of ceftriaxone for treatment of pyelonephritis. A photograph of the rash is shown. This patient's skin findings are most likely associated with which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is E. Mast cell activation in subcutaneous tissues.

The photograph shows a urticarial rash, which is characterized by pruritic, erythematous, and edematous lesions. This type of rash is typically associated with mast cell activation, which leads to the release of histamine and other mediators that cause increased permeability of blood vessels, leading to edema and inflammation.

Option A is incorrect because perivascular cutaneous polymorphonuclear infiltration is more characteristic of a hypersensitivity vasculitis.

Option B is incorrect because direct tissue damage by an irradiated antibiotic agent is not a known mechanism of skin rash.

Option C is incorrect because cytotoxic T-cell destruction of antigen-tagged cells is more characteristic of a cell-mediated immune response, such as in contact dermatitis.

Option D is incorrect because hyperpermeability of superficial dermal microvasculature is a more general term that could be associated with various types of skin lesions, but it is not specific to urticaria.",Success

An x-ray of the spine shows a wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Secondary hyperparathyroidism.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated potassium level (5.1 mEq/L) and a high creatinine level (3.8 mg/dL), indicating chronic kidney disease. The wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra is likely due to osteoporosis, which is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a common complication of chronic kidney disease, where the parathyroid glands overproduce parathyroid hormone in response to low calcium levels and high phosphate levels. This can lead to bone resorption and osteoporosis, resulting in compression fractures.

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism (A) is a rare condition that occurs when a parathyroid gland becomes autonomous and continues to produce excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone even after the underlying cause has been treated. While it is possible, it is less likely than secondary hyperparathyroidism in this scenario.

Elder abuse (C) is not supported by the patient's history or physical examination.

Pseudohypoparathyroidism (D) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the response to parathyroid hormone, leading to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. It is not consistent with the patient's laboratory results or clinical presentation.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (E) is a condition where one or more parathyroid glands become overactive and produce excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone, leading to hypercalcemia. It is not consistent with the patient's laboratory results, which show a normal calcium level.",Success
"A 50-year-old man comes to the physician because of swelling of his legs for 2 months. Three months ago, he was diagnosed with hypertension and started on a new medication. His blood pressure is 145/95 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 2+ edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. This patient was most likely treated with which of the following drugs?",E,"The correct answer is E. Amlodipine.

The patient's symptoms of swelling in the legs (edema) and the fact that he was started on a new medication for hypertension three months ago suggest that the medication is causing the edema as a side effect. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is a common antihypertensive medication that can cause edema as a side effect. The other options are less likely to cause edema: losartan and lisinopril are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic, and hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that would actually help reduce edema.",Success
An investigator is studying the function of different enzymes in various human cell types. A subset of normal human cells with an elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase is harvested and isolated. Which of the following is most likely to be absent in these cells?,A,"The correct answer is D. Lactic acid dehydrogenase.

Bisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme that converts 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate in the glycolytic pathway. It is present in high concentrations in red blood cells, where it helps to regulate the levels of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, a key allosteric effector of hemoglobin.

In cells with elevated bisphosphoglycerate mutase, it is likely that the glycolytic pathway is favored, and the cells are producing more ATP through anaerobic glycolysis. As a result, the cells are less likely to produce lactic acid, which is the end product of anaerobic glycolysis. Therefore, lactic acid dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, is likely to be absent or present at low levels in these cells.

The other options are not directly related to the presence of bisphosphoglycerate mutase and are therefore less likely to be absent in these cells.",Success

She has also had intermittent headaches over the last month and has noticed that her shirts have been getting wet unexpectedly. Blood tests reveal an abnormal elevation of a circulating substance. Which of following changes is also associated with the physiologic function of the most likely substance in this case?",B,"The correct answer is D. Increased human chorionic gonadotropin.

The symptoms described, such as frequent near-misses while driving, headaches, and unexpected wetness on her shirts, suggest that the woman may be experiencing symptoms of pregnancy, such as morning sickness and breast tenderness.

"A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of episodic headaches associated with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Over-the-counter pain medications have failed to reduce her symptoms. An MRI of the brain shows isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle. This dilatation is most likely caused by blockade of which of the following structures?",B,"The correct answer is B. Interventricular foramen.

The patient's symptoms and the MRI finding of isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle suggest a blockage of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the lateral ventricle. The interventricular foramen (also known as the foramen of Monro) connects the lateral ventricle to the third ventricle and allows CSF to flow from the lateral ventricle to the third ventricle. A blockage of this foramen would cause the lateral ventricle to dilate.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Arachnoid villi are small projections of the arachnoid membrane that allow CSF to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Blockage of arachnoid villi would not cause isolated dilation of the lateral ventricle.

C. The median aperture (also known as the foramen of Magendie) is a opening in the roof of the fourth ventricle that allows CSF to flow out of the ventricular system. Blockage of this aperture would affect the entire ventricular system, not just the lateral ventricle.

D. Lateral apertures (also known as the foramina of Luschka) are openings in the lateral walls of the fourth ventricle that allow CSF to flow out of the ventricular system. Blockage of these apertures would affect the entire ventricular system, not just the lateral ventricle.

E. The cerebral aqueduct connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle and allows CSF to flow from the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. Blockage of the cerebral aqueduct would affect the entire ventricular system, not just the lateral ventricle.",Success

Physical examination shows diffuse petechiae and bruising. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",E,"The correct answer is E. Vitamin K deficiency.

The symptoms described, such as lethargy, easy bruising, and petechiae, are consistent with a bleeding disorder. The fact that the child was born at home with minimal prenatal or postnatal care suggests that the child may not have received vitamin K prophylaxis at birth, which is a routine practice in many countries to prevent bleeding disorders in newborns.

Without treatment, this patient's current condition puts him at greatest risk for which of the following complications?",D,"The correct answer is B. Coronary artery aneurysms.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease, a vasculitis that can lead to coronary artery aneurysms if left untreated. The rash, fever, and mucocutaneous findings are all characteristic of Kawasaki disease. The patient's lack of routine childhood vaccinations increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.",Success

Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient's most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is C. Ceftriaxone.

The patient's symptoms and CSF results are consistent with bacterial meningitis, likely caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or Neisseria meningitidis. The CSF results show an elevated white blood cell count, low glucose, and high protein, which are characteristic of bacterial meningitis.

Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that is effective against both S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis, making it the best treatment option for this patient.

The causal organism of this patient's current condition most likely produces which of the following substances?",E,"The correct answer is C. Urease.

The patient's symptoms and the growth of a non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-positive, gram-negative rod in urine cultures suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Proteus mirabilis. Proteus mirabilis is a common cause of UTIs, particularly in patients with indwelling catheters. One of the key virulence factors of Proteus mirabilis is its ability to produce urease, which breaks down urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide, leading to the formation of struvite stones and contributing to the development of UTIs.",Success
"A 26-year-old man comes to the physician for episodic fever, recurrent night sweats, and a 6-kg (14.2-lb) weight loss over the past 2 months. He reports that the fever lasts for 7 to 10 days, then subsides completely for about a week before returning again. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Physical examination shows nontender cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. An x-ray of the chest shows bilateral mediastinal masses. Resection of a cervical lymph node is performed. A photomicrograph of the resected specimen is shown. Further histopathological examination is most likely to show which of the following findings?",B,"The correct answer is B. Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30.

The photomicrograph shows a lymph node with a characteristic ""cellular"" or ""mottled"" appearance, which is consistent with Hodgkin lymphoma. The presence of bilateral mediastinal masses and the patient's symptoms also support this diagnosis. CD15 and CD30 are markers that are typically positive in Reed-Sternberg cells, which are the malignant cells in Hodgkin lymphoma.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase is a marker for hairy cell leukemia, not Hodgkin lymphoma.

C. BCR-ABL rearrangement is a characteristic of chronic myeloid leukemia, not Hodgkin lymphoma.

D. Overexpression of Bcl-2 is seen in follicular lymphoma, not Hodgkin lymphoma.

E. t(8;14) chromosomal translocation is a characteristic of Burkitt lymphoma, not Hodgkin lymphoma.",Success
"A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of nausea for the last two weeks. During this period, she has had increased urinary frequency and fatigue. She also reports two episodes of non-bloody vomiting. There is no personal history of serious illness. Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago. Physical examination shows bilateral breast tenderness. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is positive. Which of the following is the most accurate predictor of the gestational age?",D,"The correct answer is D. Crown-rump length.

Crown-rump length (CRL) is the most accurate predictor of gestational age in early pregnancy, particularly between 7-12 weeks of gestation. It is a measurement of the length of the embryo or fetus from the top of the head to the bottom of the rump. CRL is a reliable indicator of gestational age because it grows at a consistent rate during early pregnancy.

The other options are not as accurate predictors of gestational age:

A. Ratio of head to abdominal circumference: This measurement is not as accurate as CRL and is typically used later in pregnancy.

B. Serum β-hCG levels: While β-hCG levels can indicate pregnancy, they are not a reliable predictor of gestational age.

C. Femoral length: This measurement is used later in pregnancy to estimate gestational age, but it is not as accurate as CRL in early pregnancy.

E. Biparietal length: This measurement is used later in pregnancy to estimate gestational age, but it is not as accurate as CRL in early pregnancy.",Success
"A 6-week-old male infant is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of recurrent nonbilious vomiting. Vomiting occurs almost immediately after most feeds. Each time, he becomes irritable while feeding and refuses to finish the bottle. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation and weighed 3300 g (7 lb 4 oz); he currently weighs 4000 g (8 lb 13 oz). He has Down syndrome. His vaccinations are up-to-date. He appears agitated and cries during the examination. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 156/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 100/49 mm Hg. Examination shows upward slanting of the eyelids, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a single transverse palmar crease on both hands. The abdomen is soft and nontender. A 2.5-cm (1-inch) epigastric mass is palpated. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis is within normal limits. Further diagnostic evaluation of the patient is most likely to show which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is D. Elongated and thickened pylorus on abdominal ultrasound.

The symptoms described, such as nonbilious vomiting, irritability, and refusal to feed, are consistent with pyloric stenosis, a common condition in infants. The presence of a 2.5-cm epigastric mass on palpation also supports this diagnosis. Abdominal ultrasound would likely show an elongated and thickened pylorus, which is a characteristic finding in pyloric stenosis.

The other options are not consistent with the symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Dilated colon segment on abdominal x-ray would be more consistent with a diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease or other conditions affecting the large intestine.

B. A high serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration would be more consistent with a diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

C. Detection of rotavirus antigen on enzyme immunoassay (EIA) would suggest a diagnosis of rotavirus gastroenteritis, which is not consistent with the symptoms and physical examination findings.

E. Tripple bubble sign on abdominal x-ray would be more consistent with a diagnosis of intestinal obstruction or malrotation, which is not supported by the symptoms and physical examination findings.",Success
"A 5-year-old Syrian immigrant and her family present for an immigration physical. Her mother describes photophobia, bilateral lacrimation, eye itching, and eyelid swelling for the last week. She is known to have an allergy to cephalosporins. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. She has met all of her developmental milestones and most of her vaccines. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 105/60 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 18/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). The physical examination is mostly normal except for her eye exam as presented in the image below. Which of the following statements is true regarding treatment of this patient’s condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. The child should be administered a single dose of oral azithromycin.

The image provided suggests that the child has bilateral conjunctivitis, which is likely caused by Chlamydia trachomatis, a common cause of conjunctivitis in children. Azithromycin is the recommended treatment for chlamydial conjunctivitis in children, and it is given as a single dose. The child's allergy to cephalosporins makes option A incorrect. Topical bacitracin (option B) is not effective against chlamydial conjunctivitis. Oral tetracycline (option C) is not recommended in children under 8 years old due to the risk of tooth discoloration.

"Three days after induction chemotherapy, a 9-year-old boy is admitted to the hospital for fever and neutropenia. He was initially diagnosed with t(9;22)-positive acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia following workup for fatigue and pancytopenia. He is fully conscious. His blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), pulse is 98/min, and respiratory rate is 14/min. Physical examination including examination of the central venous catheter site shows no source of infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated. Which of the following factors about this patient most strongly indicates a poor prognosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Cytogenetics.

The presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (t(9;22)) in a patient with acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a poor prognostic factor. This chromosomal abnormality is typically associated with a worse outcome in ALL.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Age: While age can be a prognostic factor in ALL, 9 years old is not typically considered a high-risk age group.

C. Fever and neutropenia: While fever and neutropenia are serious complications of chemotherapy, they are not necessarily indicative of a poor prognosis in this patient.

D. Initial presentation: The patient's initial presentation with fatigue and pancytopenia is not unusual for ALL, and does not necessarily indicate a poor prognosis.

E. Immunological subtype: While T-ALL can have a worse prognosis than B-ALL, the immunological subtype itself is not the strongest indicator of a poor prognosis in this patient.",Success
"A 45-year-old homeless man comes to the emergency department because of progressive neck pain for 3 days. He also reports headaches and numbness in both hands. Over the past 4 months, he has had intermittent lower back pain after waking up. The back pain improves with movement. He also has recurrent episodes of gout in the metatarsophalangeal joint of his right big toe. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years and drinks four beers daily. The patient is a known user of intravenous heroin. He appears acutely ill. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg. There are several track marks on both forearms. Examination of the neck shows warmth, erythema, and limited range of motion. Gentle palpation over the midcervical spinal processes causes severe pain.

Segmented neutrophils 77%
Eosinophils 1%
Lymphocytes 20%
Monocytes 2%
Platelet count 278,000/mm3

Blood cultures are pending. An x-ray of the cervical spine shows no abnormalities. An MRI of the spine shows signs of inflammation. A bone biopsy confirms the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",B,"The correct answer is C. Surgical debridement.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of spinal osteomyelitis, which is an infection of the spine. The MRI of the spine shows signs of inflammation, and the bone biopsy confirms the diagnosis. Surgical debridement is often necessary to remove infected tissue and bone, and to stabilize the spine. This is usually done in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.

Option A, lumbar puncture, is not necessary in this case, as the diagnosis has already been confirmed by bone biopsy.

Option B, intravenous ciprofloxacin and vancomycin therapy, may be part of the treatment plan, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Antibiotics should be started, but surgical debridement is necessary to remove the infected tissue.

Option D, oral indomethacin therapy, is not appropriate for the treatment of spinal osteomyelitis.

Option E, bone scintigraphy, is a diagnostic test that may be used to evaluate the extent of the infection, but it is not a treatment.",Success
"A 1-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department with persistent vomiting, dehydration, and irritability. Over the past week, she has been projectile vomiting after most feedings. Initially, the vomiting would occur just once or twice a day, but now it occurs after every feed. However, her appetite hasn’t decreased, and she seeks milk right after each episode of vomiting. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is breastfed exclusively. On physical exam, the vital signs include: temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), blood pressure 85/55 mm Hg, respiratory rate 28/min, and heart rate 150/min. On examination, she appears to be mildly dehydrated, listless, and irritable. Her abdomen is soft and nontender with a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region. Which of the following acid-base disturbances is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's symptoms, such as projectile vomiting, dehydration, and irritability, are consistent with pyloric stenosis, a condition that causes narrowing of the pylorus, which connects the stomach to the small intestine. The palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region is also a characteristic finding in pyloric stenosis.

The vomiting leads to loss of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and potassium ions, which can cause metabolic alkalosis. The body tries to compensate by increasing respiratory rate to expel more carbon dioxide, which can lead to respiratory alkalosis as well. However, in this case, the metabolic alkalosis is the primary acid-base disturbance.

Metabolic acidosis (option B) is unlikely because the patient is losing acidic gastric contents, which would increase the pH of the blood. Respiratory alkalosis (option A) may occur as a compensatory response to metabolic alkalosis, but it is not the primary acid-base disturbance. Respiratory acidosis (option D) and mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis (option E) are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.",Success
"A 10-year-old girl is brought to a clinic by her parents after 1 week of difficulty breathing, dry cough, and low-grade fevers. She has also developed shallow erythematous ulcers inside of her mouth. There is no history of chills, rigors, or headaches. Her appetite has decreased. The girl has been HIV-positive since birth and is being treated with HAART. Her baseline viral load is <50/mL. On general examination, the girl appears ill. Diffuse inspiratory crackles are heard on chest auscultation with normal heart sounds. No lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly is noted on physical examination. A blood sample is drawn, which shows a CD4 count of 100/mm3 and a viral load of 25,050/mL. What is the most likely mechanism responsible for the lack of responsiveness to therapy?",D,"The correct answer is D. pol gene mutation.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a failure of HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) treatment, which is likely due to the development of resistance to the antiretroviral medications. The pol gene codes for the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is the target of many antiretroviral medications. Mutations in the pol gene can lead to resistance to these medications, making them less effective in suppressing viral replication.

The other options are not directly related to the lack of responsiveness to HAART therapy:

A. Ineffective CD8 cytotoxicity refers to the immune system's inability to kill infected cells, which is not directly related to the failure of HAART.

B. gag gene mutation is not typically associated with resistance to HAART.

C. env gene mutation is related to the virus's ability to infect cells, but it is not directly related to the failure of HAART.

E. Decreased viral replication is the opposite of what is observed in this patient, who has a high viral load despite being on HAART.",Success
"A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department with confusion. The patient lives in a nursing home and has Alzheimer dementia at baseline.

PTH: 8 pg/mL

The patient is referred to another physician for a more thorough workup including laboratory work and CT imaging. Which of the following is the best long-term prophylaxis for the cause of this patient’s acute symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Alendronate.

The patient's symptoms, including confusion, somnolence, and polyuria, are consistent with hypercalcemia. The laboratory values show a high calcium level (12.2 mg/dL) and a normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) level, which suggests that the hypercalcemia is not due to primary hyperparathyroidism.

The patient's history of weight loss and polyuria suggests that the hypercalcemia may be due to a malignancy, such as multiple myeloma or bone metastases. The best long-term prophylaxis for hypercalcemia of malignancy is bisphosphonate therapy, such as alendronate.

Calcitonin (option B) is a medication that can be used to treat hypercalcemia in the short-term, but it is not a long-term solution. Furosemide (option C) is a diuretic that can help increase calcium excretion in the urine, but it is not a long-term prophylaxis for hypercalcemia. IV fluids (option D) may be used to treat dehydration, but they are not a long-term solution for hypercalcemia.

Even after being successfully treated for her urinary condition, she continues to show restricted social interaction. Which of the following is a true statement regarding the patient's condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. She fears not being able to escape similar situations.

The patient's behavior is consistent with a specific phobia, specifically situational phobia, which is a type of anxiety disorder.

"A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department with dyspnea and palpitations. He does not smoke cigarettes or consume alcohol, and past medical history is insignificant. Blood pressure is 115/75 mmHG and heart rate is 125/min. Heart rhythm is irregularly irregular. After initial treatment with IV digoxin the patient's heart rate drops to 85/min and remains irregular. Which of the following best explains the effect of digoxin in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Vagal stimulation.

Digoxin works by increasing the parasympathetic tone, which stimulates the vagus nerve, leading to a decrease in heart rate. In atrial fibrillation, digoxin helps to slow the ventricular rate by increasing the refractory period of the AV node, allowing fewer impulses to reach the ventricles. This is why the patient's heart rate dropped to 85/min after treatment with IV digoxin.",Success
"Public health researchers are reviewing data from an outbreak of hepatitis A that was traced to contaminated produce from a popular restaurant. A case series investigation with prospective and retrospective follow-up found that 500 individuals dined at the restaurant during the week of study. The incidence of hepatitis A infection was found to be 25%, and the total number of deaths recorded among the incident cases was 5 individuals. What was the case-fatality rate for the hepatitis A outbreak?",A,"The correct answer is B. 5%.

To calculate the case-fatality rate, you need to divide the number of deaths (5) by the total number of cases (25% of 500, which is 125) and multiply by 100.

Case-fatality rate = (Number of deaths ÷ Number of cases) × 100

On physical examination, the patient is drowsy but follows commands. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. The remainder of the initial examination is unremarkable. While the patient is being transferred to observation, his level of consciousness acutely declines. Repeat vital signs are significant for a blood pressure of 190/110 mm Hg. Ophthalmic examination now shows a fixed and dilated left pupil with no pupillary light reflex. A noncontrast CT of the head is performed and is shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Tearing of the middle meningeal artery.

The patient's symptoms and CT scan are consistent with an epidural hematoma, which is typically caused by tearing of the middle meningeal artery. The patient's initial presentation with anterograde amnesia and normal vital signs, followed by a rapid decline in level of consciousness and development of a fixed and dilated pupil, is consistent with this diagnosis.

He complains of frequent episodes of waking up in the middle of his sleep. When he wakes up, he feels excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness. His morning blood glucose is high on repeated measurement. Which of the following is the optimal intervention for this patient condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Reducing daily insulin dose.

The patient's symptoms of waking up in the middle of the night with excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness are indicative of nocturnal hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). The high morning blood glucose levels suggest that the body is responding to the hypoglycemic episode by releasing stress hormones, which raise blood sugar levels. The optimal intervention in this case would be to reduce the daily insulin dose to prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia.",Success
"A researcher conducts multiple experiments to establish an infection and disease model for Clostridium perfringens in chickens. To ensure that all instruments are free of the pathogenic organism, he uses a disinfectant that oxidizes and denatures proteins. Which of the following disinfectants did the researcher most likely use?",A,"The correct answer is A. Chlorine dioxide.

Chlorine dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent that is effective against a wide range of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It works by oxidizing and denaturing proteins, which ultimately leads to the death of the microorganism. This makes it a suitable choice for disinfecting instruments and surfaces to prevent the spread of Clostridium perfringens.

The other options are not as effective against Clostridium perfringens or do not work by oxidizing and denaturing proteins:

* Isopropyl alcohol (B) is a solvent that can denature proteins, but it is not as effective against bacterial spores as chlorine dioxide.
* Phenol (C) is a disinfectant that works by denaturing proteins, but it is not as effective against Clostridium perfringens as chlorine dioxide.
* Povidone-iodine (D) is an iodophor that works by releasing iodine, which is toxic to microorganisms. While it is effective against many microorganisms, it may not be as effective against Clostridium perfringens as chlorine dioxide.

Her random blood glucose is 220 mg/dL and HbA1C is 8.5%. She wants to discuss possible complications concerning her pregnancy. Which of the following cardiac complications is her infant at high risk for?",B,"The correct answer is B. Transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Maternal diabetes, especially if poorly controlled, increases the risk of cardiac defects in the fetus. The most common cardiac defect associated with maternal diabetes is transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a condition where the heart muscle becomes thickened, leading to reduced heart function. This condition is usually reversible after birth, but it can cause complications during the neonatal period.

The other options are not directly related to maternal diabetes:

A. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is a genetic disorder that can occur in the general population, but it is not specifically associated with maternal diabetes.

C. Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect that can occur in the general population, but it is not directly related to maternal diabetes.

His vital signs are within normal limits. The neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense. The rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Spinal metastasis.

The patient's symptoms, including back pain, bilateral lower limb weakness, and difficulty controlling bowel movements, suggest a compressive lesion in the spinal cord. The presence of a hard nodular mass on rectal examination and a weak rectal sphincter tone further support this diagnosis. Spinal metastasis is a common cause of spinal cord compression in adults, and it is likely that the patient's cancer has metastasized to the spine, causing his symptoms.

Syringomyelia (A) is a condition characterized by a fluid-filled cavity in the spinal cord, which can cause weakness, numbness, and loss of reflexes, but it is less likely to cause a hard nodular mass on rectal examination.

A herniated disc (C) can cause back pain and weakness, but it is typically unilateral and would not cause a hard nodular mass on rectal examination.

An epidural abscess (D) is a bacterial infection that can cause spinal cord compression, but it would typically present with fever, chills, and rapid progression of symptoms, which are not mentioned in this scenario.

Which of the following is the best next step in therapy?",D,"The correct answer is D. Modafinil.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with narcolepsy, a chronic neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness), and disrupted nighttime sleep. The patient's Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 17 also supports this diagnosis.

Modafinil is a wake-promoting medication that is commonly used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy. It is a first-line treatment for narcolepsy and has been shown to be effective in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness and improving cognitive function.

Clomipramine (A) is a tricyclic antidepressant that may be used to treat cataplexy, but it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for excessive daytime sleepiness.

Dextroamphetamine (B) and methylphenidate (C) are stimulants that may be used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but they are not typically used as first-line treatments for narcolepsy.

To reduce the likelihood of falls, the most appropriate management is which of the following?",A,"The correct answer is A. Cooling the dialysate.

The patient is experiencing lightheadedness after hemodialysis sessions, which is likely due to hypotension. Cooling the dialysate can help reduce the likelihood of falls by reducing the risk of hypotension. Cooling the dialysate can help to reduce the vasodilatory effects of hemodialysis, which can contribute to hypotension.

The other options are not directly related to reducing the likelihood of falls due to hypotension:

B. Eating heavier meals during dialysis may help to increase blood pressure, but it is not a direct solution to the problem.

C. Increasing salt intake may help to increase blood pressure, but it is not a recommended strategy for managing hypotension in hemodialysis patients.

The patient's hemoptysis, diffuse muscle pain, and shortness of breath are consistent with pulmonary hemorrhage, a hallmark of Goodpasture's syndrome. The laboratory results show evidence of kidney damage, including proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated creatinine.

The treatment of Goodpasture's syndrome typically involves a combination of immunosuppressive therapy to reduce the production of anti-GBM antibodies and plasmapheresis to remove the circulating antibodies. Methylprednisolone is a glucocorticoid that can help reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. Cyclophosphamide is a cytotoxic agent that can help reduce the production of anti-GBM antibodies. Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes the antibodies from the blood, which can help reduce the damage to the kidneys and lungs.

Option D is the most appropriate treatment for this patient, as it combines the immunosuppressive effects of methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide with the antibody-removing effects of plasmapheresis.",Success
"A 39-year-old woman presents with headaches, constipation, increased thirst, and increased urinary frequency. Her blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg and pulse is 67/min. Blood tests reveal high blood glucose and low potassium level. Abdominal CT scan shows a well-circumscribed homogeneous mass in the left adrenal gland. The hormone excess responsible for her symptoms uses which of the following pathways to exert its action?",A,"The correct answer is C. cAMP pathway.

The symptoms described, such as hypertension, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia, are consistent with an aldosterone-producing adenoma (Conn's syndrome). Aldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland that regulates electrolyte balance and blood pressure. It acts through the cAMP pathway, specifically by binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor, which activates adenylate cyclase and increases cAMP production. This leads to the reabsorption of sodium and water in the kidneys, resulting in hypertension, and the excretion of potassium, leading to hypokalemia.",Success
"A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a headache. He states that this is the worst headache he has ever had and that his symptoms have not been improving. The patient complains of pain in his jaw that is worse when he chews. He has a past medical history of insomnia and is currently taking alprazolam. His temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 157/98 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for tenderness over the patient's scalp, jaw, and temporal area. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. IV steroids.

The patient's symptoms, including a severe headache, jaw pain that worsens with chewing, and tenderness over the scalp, jaw, and temporal area, are consistent with giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis. GCA is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent vision loss.

The best next step in management is to administer IV steroids to reduce inflammation and prevent further complications. Steroids are the first-line treatment for GCA, and prompt initiation of therapy can help prevent vision loss and other complications.

A CT head may be ordered to rule out other causes of headache, but it is not the best next step in management. Ibuprofen may provide some symptomatic relief, but it is not a definitive treatment for GCA. Lumbar puncture is not typically indicated in the diagnosis of GCA. Temporal artery biopsy is a diagnostic test that can confirm the diagnosis of GCA, but it is not the best next step in management, as treatment should be initiated promptly to prevent complications.",Success
"A 34-year-old man with acute lymphocytic leukemia presents for follow-up in the oncology clinic after his second cycle of chemotherapy. In addition to intermittent nausea, he has mild weakness, tingling, and numbness in his left hand. With his affected hand, he is able to grip, but occasionally drops small objects. His oncologist tells him that one of his chemotherapy agents likely caused his neuropathy given its strong association with neurotoxicity. He was recently treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and dasatinib. The culprit medication works by which of the following mechanisms of action?",B,"The correct answer is B. Blocks microtubule formation.

The patient's symptoms of neuropathy, including weakness, tingling, and numbness in his left hand, are likely caused by vincristine, which is a vinca alkaloid that works by blocking microtubule formation. Vincristine is known to cause neurotoxicity, particularly peripheral neuropathy, as a side effect of its mechanism of action.",Success
"A 1-day-old infant is in the neonatal intensive care unit due to respiratory failure from pulmonary hypoplasia. The mother is a healthy 32-year-old woman who did not have regular prenatal exams. On physical examination, you notice low-set ears and retrognathia with abnormal extremity development. Which of the following abnormalities is associated with the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",C,"The correct answer is D. Rocker bottom feet.

The symptoms described in the question, including pulmonary hypoplasia, low-set ears, retrognathia, and abnormal extremity development, are consistent with Potter sequence, a rare congenital disorder caused by oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid) due to bilateral renal agenesis (absence of kidneys). Rocker bottom feet are a characteristic feature of Potter sequence.

The other options are not directly related to the symptoms described:

A. Hepatosplenomegaly is associated with various conditions, including liver disease, but not with pulmonary hypoplasia or the other symptoms described.

B. Macroorchidism is a feature of Fragile X syndrome, which is not related to the symptoms described.

C. Posterior urethral valves are a congenital anomaly that can cause urinary tract obstruction, but they are not typically associated with pulmonary hypoplasia or the other symptoms described.

"A 47-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer who is undergoing chemotherapy comes to the physician for a follow-up exam. She reports extreme fatigue since beginning her chemotherapy regimen. Her pulse is 98/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg. Her hemoglobin is 10.4 g/dL, leukocyte count is 800/mm3 with 5% monocytes, and platelet count is 50,000/mm3. The patient is started on a new medication. One week later, serum studies show a hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 2,000/mm3 with 2% monocytes, and a platelet count of 56,000/mm3. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?",C,"The correct answer is E. Sargramostim.

The patient's blood counts show an increase in white blood cell count (WBC) and a slight increase in platelet count, but no significant change in hemoglobin. This suggests that the medication is stimulating the production of white blood cells, but not red blood cells or platelets.

Sargramostim is a granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that stimulates the production of white blood cells, particularly granulocytes and macrophages. It is often used to support bone marrow recovery after chemotherapy.

Filgrastim (C) is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that also stimulates white blood cell production, but it is more specific for granulocytes and would not increase monocyte counts.

Aldesleukin (A) is an interleukin-2 that stimulates the immune system, but it would not specifically increase WBC counts.

Interferon beta (B) is an antiviral and immunomodulatory agent that would not increase WBC counts.

Romiplostim (D) is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist that stimulates platelet production, but it would not increase WBC counts.",Success
"A male newborn born at 27 weeks' gestation is evaluated for rapid breathing and hypoxia shortly after birth. His mother had no prenatal care. Cardiopulmonary examination shows normal heart sounds, intercostal retractions, and nasal flaring. An x-ray of the chest shows low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities. He is started on nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",C,"The correct answer is C. Hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy.

The symptoms described, such as rapid breathing and hypoxia, along with the chest x-ray findings of low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities, are consistent with Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS). RDS is a common condition in preterm infants, particularly those born before 32 weeks' gestation.

Hyaline membranes are a characteristic finding in RDS, and they would be seen lining the alveoli on lung biopsy. They are composed of dead cells, fibrin, and other debris that accumulate in the alveoli due to the lack of surfactant, a substance that helps to expand the lungs and maintain airflow.

The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis of RDS:

A. Bilateral pleural effusions on lung ultrasound would be more consistent with a diagnosis of pleural effusion or chylothorax.

B. Corkscrew-shaped organisms on umbilical cord culture would suggest a diagnosis of listeriosis, which is not related to RDS.

D. Meconium-stained fluid on deep suctioning would suggest a diagnosis of meconium aspiration syndrome, which is a different condition.

Abdominal ultrasonography shows a normal liver, a common bile duct caliber of 10 mm (normal < 6 mm) and a gallbladder with multiple gallstones and no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Choledocholithiasis.

The patient's symptoms of severe, sharp, penetrating abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, are consistent with biliary colic. The presence of multiple gallstones in the gallbladder and a dilated common bile duct (10 mm) on ultrasonography suggest that a stone has passed into the common bile duct, causing obstruction and jaundice. The elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and bilirubin levels support this diagnosis. The absence of fever, guarding, and rebound tenderness makes cholecystitis (option D) less likely. The patient's history of Crohn's disease and resection of the terminal ileum is a red herring and not directly related to the current symptoms.",Success

Her medical history is positive only for frequent bouts of sinusitis. She currently denies any smoking, drinks a glass of red wine/day, and she denies any past illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 87/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. Her physical examination shows decreased air movement throughout the right lung but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur, and a gravid uterus without acute findings. On physical examination, she is afebrile, tachycardic to 121/min, normotensive, and demonstrates an O2 saturation of 92%. Which of the following is the best next step in the evaluation of the most likely diagnosis for this patient?",D,"The correct answer is A. D-dimer.

The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and right-sided chest pain, especially with inspiration, are concerning for a pulmonary embolism (PE). The fact that she recently traveled from New York to the west coast also increases her risk for a PE. Given her pregnancy, a D-dimer assay is a reasonable next step in the evaluation. A D-dimer is a sensitive test for PE, and a negative result can help rule out the diagnosis. If the D-dimer is positive, further imaging studies such as a V/Q scan or CT pulmonary angiogram may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",Success

Colonoscopy with biopsy is later performed showing a neoplastic growth in the descending colon. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for his cardiac findings?",E,"The correct answer is A. Viridans streptococci.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest endocarditis, which is supported by the presence of a new-onset high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur, conjunctival hemorrhages, and petechiae on his lower extremities. The ""head bobbing with each heartbeat"" is also consistent with endocarditis.

The most likely explanation for the cardiac findings is infective endocarditis caused by Viridans streptococci, which is a common cause of endocarditis in patients with underlying cardiac conditions or in those with a history of dental procedures. The patient's history of colon cancer and the presence of a neoplastic growth in the descending colon may have led to bacteremia, which then seeded the heart valves, causing endocarditis.

Option B, Treponema pallidum, is unlikely as the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of syphilis. Option C, Malignant colonic neoplasm, is related to the patient's underlying cancer, but it is not the direct cause of the cardiac findings. Option D, Collagen vascular disease, is not supported by the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings.

Her fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 122 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Check serum electrolytes.

The patient's symptoms, such as confusion, unusual behavior, and psychomotor agitation, are consistent with delirium. The fact that she has not been eating or drinking much for the past 6 days suggests that she may be dehydrated and have electrolyte imbalances, which can contribute to delirium. Hydrochlorothiazide, her medication for hypertension, can also cause electrolyte imbalances. Therefore, checking serum electrolytes is the most appropriate next step in management.

While a lumbar puncture (A) may be necessary to rule out meningitis or encephalitis, it is not the most immediate concern given the patient's symptoms and physical examination. Checking serum TSH level (B) may be necessary to rule out hypothyroidism, but it is not the most urgent step.

The patient does not have any current complaints except for occasional numbness in both hands and feet. His HbA1C is 8.5% and serum glucose is 240 mg/dL. Which of the following is the best next step in this patient’s condition?,C,"The correct answer is C. Add a sulfonylurea.

The patient's HbA1C is 8.5%, which indicates that his blood sugar control is not optimal, and his serum glucose is 240 mg/dL, which is above the target range. The patient is already on metformin, which is a first-line medication for type 2 diabetes, but it is not sufficient to control his blood sugar levels. Adding a sulfonylurea, which stimulates the release of insulin from the pancreas, is a reasonable next step to improve blood sugar control.

Starting basal-bolus insulin (Option A) may be premature at this stage, as the patient's blood sugar levels are not severely uncontrolled. Continuing metformin monotherapy (Option B) is unlikely to improve the patient's blood sugar control. Adding an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor (Option D) or a thiazolidinedione (Option E) may not be as effective as adding a sulfonylurea in this situation.",Success
"A 42-year-old chronic alcoholic man was admitted to the hospital for inappropriate behavior and disturbed memory. He presents with severe retrograde memory loss, confusion, and confabulation. Neurologic examination showed horizontal nystagmus. He also has bilateral pretibial pitting edema and perioral erythema. CT studies of the brain were normal. The duty physician suspects the patient may be vitamin deficient. Which of the following reactions does the deficient vitamin mediate?",A,"The correct answer is D. Isocitrate + NAD+ <=> Alpha-Ketoglutarate + CO2 + NADH.

The patient's symptoms, including severe retrograde memory loss, confusion, and confabulation, are consistent with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is caused by a deficiency of thiamine (Vitamin B1). Thiamine is a coenzyme for several enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including transketolase and pyruvate dehydrogenase.

The reaction mediated by thiamine is the conversion of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, which is catalyzed by the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase. This reaction is part of the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) and is essential for the production of energy in the form of ATP.

The other options are not directly related to thiamine deficiency:

A. Alpha-Ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA <=> Succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH is the reaction catalyzed by alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, which requires coenzyme A and NAD+.

A 7-year-old boy is brought to your office with complaints of wheezing and dyspnea. Laboratory work reveals eosinophilia and positive skin tests for allergens. Which of the following types of drugs would be an effective treatment in this patient?,D,"The correct answer is A. Beta-2 antagonist.

The patient's symptoms of wheezing and dyspnea, along with the laboratory results of eosinophilia and positive skin tests for allergens, suggest a diagnosis of asthma. Beta-2 antagonists, such as salmeterol or formoterol, are a type of bronchodilator that can help relieve bronchospasm and improve lung function in patients with asthma. They work by stimulating the beta-2 receptors in the lungs, which causes the airways to relax and open up, making it easier to breathe.

A 16-year-old healthy female presents to her pediatrician concerned that she has not had a menstrual period. She has no past medical history and takes no medications. She plays volleyball and gets good grades in school. Her BMI is 22 kg/m2. Physical examination reveals normal female external genitalia and pubic hair along the mons pubis and superomedial thighs. Her breasts appear normal. Transabdominal ultrasound reveals an absent uterus. Serum testosterone levels is within the normal range for females. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?,E,"The correct answer is E. Failure of paramesonephric duct development.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a normal female phenotype, but the absence of a uterus on transabdominal ultrasound indicates a developmental anomaly. The normal serum testosterone levels rule out androgen-related disorders. The presence of normal female external genitalia and pubic hair suggests that the patient has a normal karyotype (46,XX), making option B unlikely.

The patient's condition is consistent with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a rare congenital disorder characterized by the absence or abnormal development of the uterus and vagina.

He was coming to the United States to spend time with some extended family. According to the grand-daughter his mental status was altered upon arrival and his health began to decline. She is not aware of his past medical status or medications. At the hospital, his blood pressure is 98/60 mm Hg, the pulse id 110/min, the respiratory rate is 21/min, and the temperature is 35.6°C (96.1°F). On physical exam, the patient appears cachectic, drowsy, and only responds to questions by nodding his head. His heart rate is tachycardic with a regular rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The cystotomy incision for his suprapelvic catheter is red and swollen. The patient admitted to the hospital and stabilized and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The catheter tube produces no urine over 24 hours and only thick green-white puss can be expressed. The treatment team concludes this patient has urinary tract obstruction. What is the best method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Ultrasound.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest a urinary tract obstruction, and the best method to evaluate this would be an ultrasound. Ultrasound is a non-invasive and quick imaging modality that can assess the kidneys, ureters, and bladder for any obstruction or hydronephrosis. It can also help identify any stones or other causes of obstruction.

Renal biopsy (A) is not indicated in this scenario, as it is an invasive procedure that is typically used to diagnose kidney disease or cancer.

Abdominal-pelvic CT scan (C) may be useful in evaluating the urinary tract, but it would expose the patient to radiation and may not be necessary in this case.

Blood analysis (D) may be useful in evaluating the patient's overall health and detecting any signs of infection or organ dysfunction, but it would not specifically evaluate urinary tract obstruction.

Urine analysis (E) may be useful in evaluating for urinary tract infection, but it would not directly evaluate urinary tract obstruction.",Success
"A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider for intermittent shaking of his hands. He reports that for the last several years he has noticed this ""shaking"" when he brushes his teeth and prepares a cup of coffee in the morning. The shaking then gradually improves over the course of the day. His past medical history is otherwise notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His only home medication is pravastatin. The patient smokes half a pack per day of cigarettes and drinks 2-3 beers throughout the day. His family history is significant for Parkinson disease in his father. On physical exam, his blood pressure is 159/84, pulse is 74/min, and respirations are 12/min. He has a high frequency bilateral hand tremor elicited on finger-to-nose testing. His neurological exam is otherwise unremarkable. This patient should be started on which of the following medications?",C,"The correct answer is B. Primidone.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with essential tremor, a neurological disorder characterized by involuntary shaking or trembling of various parts of the body, often affecting the hands. The fact that the tremor improves over the course of the day and is elicited on finger-to-nose testing supports this diagnosis.

Primidone is a medication commonly used to treat essential tremor. It is an anticonvulsant that has been shown to be effective in reducing tremor amplitude and improving functional abilities in patients with essential tremor.

Alprazolam (A) is a benzodiazepine that may be used to treat anxiety or insomnia, but it is not typically used to treat essential tremor. Propranolol (C) is a beta blocker that may be used to treat certain types of tremors, such as those associated with anxiety or hyperthyroidism, but it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for essential tremor. Topiramate (D) is an anticonvulsant that is sometimes used to treat essential tremor, but it is not as commonly used as primidone. Trihexyphenidyl (E) is an anticholinergic medication that is sometimes used to treat Parkinson's disease, but it is not typically used to treat essential tremor.",Success
"A pediatrician notices that 9 of her patients this year have developed paralysis after a flu-like illness. They range in age from 7 to 11, and most of them had no abnormal activities prior to developing the paralysis. These patients concern her because she has not seen this type of paralytic illness in over 20 years of practice. Based on this experience, she decides to write up the initial presentation and clinical course of these patients and publish them in a journal. Which of the following is most likely true about this study?",B,"The correct answer is B. Hypothesis testing cannot be performed.

This study is a case series, which is a descriptive study that reports on a series of patients with a particular condition or outcome. The pediatrician is simply reporting on the characteristics and outcomes of the 9 patients who developed paralysis after a flu-like illness. There is no control group, and no intervention is being tested. Therefore, hypothesis testing, which requires a comparison between groups, cannot be performed.

The other options are not correct:

A. This study is not an experiment, so different interventions with 2 or more variables cannot be studied.

C. Odds ratio is a measure of association used in case-control studies, which is not the design of this study.

D. Relative risk is a measure of association used in cohort studies, which is also not the design of this study.

"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after a motor vehicle accident. He is unconscious upon arrival and is found to have severe internal bleeding due to trauma. He is taken for emergency surgery and severely damaged tissues are removed. After surgery, the boy is taken into the PICU for recovery. Over the subsequent week, serial labs are drawn showing target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. He is started on a prophylactic regimen that is continued upon discharge. Which of the following is consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed in this case?",C,"The correct answer is E. Folate metabolism inhibitor.

The patient's lab results, including target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis, are consistent with a diagnosis of hypercoagulability due to trauma and tissue damage. The prophylactic regimen started in this case is likely to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is a common complication in trauma patients.

The most likely drug prescribed in this case is a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), which is a common prophylactic agent for VTE. However, the mechanism of action described in the options is not consistent with LMWH.

The correct answer is E. Folate metabolism inhibitor, which is the mechanism of action of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). TMP-SMX is often prescribed prophylactically in trauma patients to prevent pneumocystis pneumonia, which is a common complication in immunocompromised patients. The mechanism of action of TMP-SMX involves inhibiting folate metabolism, which is necessary for bacterial growth and proliferation.",Success
"A 25-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of several weeks of intense itching, particularly localized around his anus. Of note, the patient denies any recent travel, sexual contacts, fever, dysuria, or diarrhea. His temperature is 98.1°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 12/min. On exam, the patient demonstrates severe excoriations in his perianal region with slight erythema over the areas that are torn. He does not have any other dermatologic findings. The scotch tape test is positive. The patient has a previous documented allergy to albendazole. Which of the following is an alternative medication that can be used?",E,"The correct answer is E. Pyrantel pamoate.

The patient's symptoms and positive scotch tape test suggest a diagnosis of pinworm infection (Enterobius vermicularis). The patient has an allergy to albendazole, which is a common treatment for pinworm infection. Pyrantel pamoate is an alternative medication that can be used to treat pinworm infection.

Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication, not effective against pinworms. Diethylcarbamazine is used to treat filariasis, not pinworm infection. Ivermectin is used to treat strongyloidiasis and scabies, but not pinworm infection. Praziquantel is used to treat tapeworm infections, not pinworm infection.",Success
"A 21-year-old female presents to the office after a health screening in which she was found to have high blood pressure. At the office, the blood pressure is 168/114 mm Hg. You have seen the patient in the past for amenorrhea and infertility issues, but she denies taking any medication at this time. On examination, the patient is short and normal weight but has a webbed neck. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the elevated blood pressure?",A,"The correct answer is A. Central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys.

The patient's physical characteristics, such as a webbed neck and short stature, suggest Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects females. One of the common features of Turner syndrome is hypertension, which is often due to coarctation of the aorta or renal anomalies, including horseshoe kidney (central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys). This is the most likely cause of the patient's elevated blood pressure.",Success
A 25-year-old African American man presents to his primary care provider for routine blood work. He is a well-known case of sickle cell disease treated with hydroxyurea and tramadol as needed for pain. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. The patient asks if his disease can adversely affect his kidneys because his friend was recently diagnosed with end-stage renal failure. Which of the following is a renal complication of sickle cell disease?,E,"The correct answer is E. Impaired urine concentration ability.

Sickle cell disease can cause several renal complications, including impaired urine concentration ability, which is a common finding in patients with sickle cell disease. This is due to damage to the renal medulla and the inability of the kidneys to concentrate urine properly.

The other options are not correct:

A. Transitional cell carcinoma is a type of bladder cancer, not a renal complication of sickle cell disease.

B. Membranous glomerulonephritis is a type of glomerulonephritis, but it is not a common complication of sickle cell disease.

"A clinical trial is conducted to test the efficacy of a new drug, A, to treat tinea versicolor. A total of 500 participants are recruited for the study and are randomized into 2 groups in equal numbers. Group 1, the study treatment group, is given drug A, while group 2, the control group, is given the current standard antifungal therapy. After the completion of therapy, 190 participants from the study treatment group and 165 participants from the control group are cured. Which calculation below represents the number needed to treat for the new drug?",B,"The correct answer is B. 250/25.

To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), you need to find the difference in the number of participants cured between the study treatment group and the control group, and then take the reciprocal of that difference.

In this case, the number of participants cured in the study treatment group is 190, and the number of participants cured in the control group is 165. The difference is 190 - 165 = 25.

Since there are 250 participants in each group, the NNT is 250/25, which represents the number of patients that need to be treated with the new drug to prevent one additional case of tinea versicolor compared to the standard antifungal therapy.",Success
"A 38-year-old woman is being evaluated by her primary care physician for chronic, widespread pain that started around 5 months ago. This pain has been accompanied by sleeping issues. Her friend recommended that she try yoga to relieve the pain, but she says this has not helped her at all. Se says the symptoms have begun to impact her daily functions and keep her from doing things she used to enjoy. Past medical history includes generalized anxiety disorder, for which she currently takes no medication. The patient had been previously medicated with paroxetine for 5 years. On physical examination, several areas of point tenderness are found on the occipital region, elbows, and medial surface of both knees. Laboratory work up is unremarkable. What is the best treatment option for the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Paroxetine.

The patient's symptoms, including chronic widespread pain, sleeping issues, and point tenderness in specific areas, are consistent with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia. The patient's history of generalized anxiety disorder and previous response to paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), suggest that this medication may be effective in managing her symptoms.

"A 29-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. On presentation, he is found to have scalp and trunk lacerations that are still actively bleeding. He has no past medical history and does not take any medications. On presentation, his temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 110/74 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical exam, he is found to be anxious but does not have any visible injuries other than the lacerations. Which of the following processes would most likely be seen in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Increased norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node.

The patient is anxious and has a normal blood pressure, which suggests that he is experiencing a stress response to the trauma. This stress response is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system, which releases norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) and other catecholamines. Norepinephrine acts on the sinoatrial node to increase heart rate, which is why the patient's pulse is 82/min.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's presentation:

A. Baroreceptor-mediated vasodilation would decrease blood pressure, which is not seen in this patient.

B. Chemoreceptor-mediated vasoconstriction is related to changes in blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

C. Increased acetylcholine at the sinoatrial node would decrease heart rate, which is the opposite of what is seen in this patient.

Free T4 6 pmol/L N: 10–20 pmol/L
What is the necessary treatment?",D,"The correct answer is D. Surgical resection.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of hypopituitarism, specifically a pituitary tumor compressing the pituitary gland and causing hormone deficiencies. The symptoms include:

* Frequent headaches and fatigue (suggesting a mass effect on the pituitary gland)
* Weight gain despite a healthy diet (suggesting hypothyroidism)
* Frequent urination (suggesting diabetes insipidus)
* Nonpitting edema and decreased reflexes (suggesting hypothyroidism)
* Papilledema and bitemporal hemianopsia (suggesting increased intracranial pressure)

The laboratory findings support this diagnosis, including:

* Low sodium and potassium levels (suggesting adrenal insufficiency)
* Low glucose level (suggesting hypoglycemia)
* Low bicarbonate level (suggesting metabolic acidosis)
* Low TSH and free T4 levels (suggesting hypothyroidism)

"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?",E,"The correct answer is E. A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.

Here's why:

* Northern blot detects RNA, and HIF-1α is a protein, so options A and B are not relevant.
* Southern blot detects DNA, and HIF-1α is a protein, so options C and D are not relevant.

Bleeding time: 3 minutes
Prothrombin time: 11 seconds
Partial thromboplastin time: 53 seconds
Bradykinin formation: decreased

Which of the following factors is most likely defective in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Factor XII.

* The bleeding time is normal (3 minutes), which suggests that platelet function is normal.
* The prothrombin time (PT) is normal (11 seconds), which suggests that the extrinsic coagulation pathway is normal.
* The partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is prolonged (53 seconds), which suggests a defect in the intrinsic coagulation pathway.
* The bradykinin formation is decreased, which is a clue that points to a defect in the contact activation pathway, which involves factor XII.

Factor XII is involved in the contact activation pathway and is necessary for the formation of bradykinin. A defect in factor XII would lead to decreased bradykinin formation and a prolonged PTT.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's syncope?",C,"The correct answer is A. Hypomagnesemia.

The patient's symptoms and telemetry results are consistent with torsades de pointes, a type of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that can cause syncope. Torsades de pointes is often associated with QT prolongation, which can be caused by various factors, including electrolyte imbalances such as hypomagnesemia. Azithromycin, one of the patient's medications, can also prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of torsades de pointes.

Hypomagnesemia is a common electrolyte imbalance that can occur in patients with diabetes, and it can contribute to QT prolongation and torsades de pointes. The other options are less likely to be the underlying cause of this patient's syncope:

Target concentration = 2 mg/L = 2,000 μg/L (since 1 mg = 1,000 μg)
Clearance = 15.0 L/h
Bioavailability = 75% = 0.75
Frequency = 2 times per day

First, we need to convert the clearance from L/h to L/dosing interval. Since the frequency is 2 times per day, the dosing interval is 12 hours. We can convert the clearance as follows:

Clearance (L/dosing interval) = 15.0 L/h x 12 h / 2 = 90 L/dosing interval

Now, we can plug in the values:

Dose = (2,000 μg/L x 90 L/dosing interval) / (0.75 x 2)
Dose = 240,000 μg / 1.5
Dose = 160,000 μg

Since the options are in milligrams, we need to convert the dose from micrograms to milligrams:

Dose (mg) = 160,000 μg / 1,000 μg/mg = 160 mg

The closest option to 160 mg is:

"A 5-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office by his parents after they noticed blood in his urine. The child has been complaining of difficulty in passing urine and has lower abdominal pain. He seems more bloated than usual. On some occasions, he starts crying while passing urine, primarily because of a burning sensation. A urinalysis is performed, and the results are as follows:
Urine pH 6.2
Urine specific gravity 1.010
Glucose Negative
Ketones Negative
RBCs 1-2/hpf
WBCs 0-1/hpf
Casts 2-3/hpf
The pediatrician believes the boy has a bladder infection with a double-stranded DNA virus. Which of the following conditions is also commonly associated with this viral infection?",A,"The correct answer is D. Vesicular rash.

The symptoms described in the question, such as blood in the urine, difficulty passing urine, lower abdominal pain, and burning sensation while urinating, are consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI). The urinalysis results also support this diagnosis.

The pediatrician's suspicion of a double-stranded DNA virus suggests that the infection is caused by adenovirus, which is a common cause of UTIs in children. Adenovirus is also associated with a vesicular rash, which is a characteristic feature of hand-foot-and-mouth disease.

The other options are not directly related to adenovirus infection:

A. Gastroenteritis is a symptom of rotavirus infection, not adenovirus.

B. Painful dermatomal vesicles are characteristic of herpes zoster (shingles) infection, not adenovirus.

C. Lymphadenopathy is a symptom of various infections, including viral and bacterial infections, but it is not specifically associated with adenovirus.

"A 46-year-old woman presents with difficulty initiating sleep, as well as frequent nighttime awakenings. She reports making multiple mistakes at her office job, has an inability to concentrate, and feels sleepy throughout the day. She is worried that her sleeping troubles will cause her to get fired. Which of the following would best treat this patient’s insomnia pharmacologically?",C,"The correct answer is C. Triazolam.

Triazolam is a benzodiazepine that is specifically approved for the treatment of insomnia, particularly for difficulty initiating sleep. It has a short half-life, which makes it suitable for short-term use and reduces the risk of daytime sedation.

Citalopram (A) is an antidepressant that may cause insomnia as a side effect, rather than treating it.

Chlordiazepoxide (B) is a benzodiazepine that is used to treat anxiety, but it has a longer half-life than triazolam and may cause daytime sedation.

Diazepam (D) is a benzodiazepine that is used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms, and seizures, but it is not specifically approved for insomnia and has a longer half-life than triazolam.

Modafinil (E) is a wake-promoting agent that is used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift work sleep disorder. It is not typically used to treat insomnia.",Success
"A 5-year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician for evaluation of difficulties noted at school. Her kindergarten teacher voiced her concern that the child ‘spaces out’ often and thinks she may have ADHD. The parents deny any history of head trauma or infection. Her blood pressure is 106/74 mm Hg, the heart rate is 69/min, and the respiratory rate is 14/min. Physical exam demonstrates a happy child who has reached developmental milestones. Laboratory results are within normal limits. EEG demonstrates a 3-Hz spike and wave pattern (see image). The decision is made to start the child on medical therapy. What should be advised to the parents as a potential side effect of the first-line medication?",B,"The correct answer is B. GI upset.

The EEG result suggests that the child has absence seizures, a type of epilepsy. The first-line medication for absence seizures is typically ethosuximide or valproic acid. Both of these medications can cause gastrointestinal (GI) upset, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, as a potential side effect.

The other options are not correct:

A. Nystagmus is a side effect of certain anticonvulsant medications, but it is not typically associated with ethosuximide or valproic acid.

C. Facial rash and blood in the urine are not typical side effects of ethosuximide or valproic acid.

D. Profound leukopenia (a decrease in white blood cell count) is not a common side effect of ethosuximide or valproic acid.

E. Weight gain and change in hair color are not typical side effects of ethosuximide or valproic acid.",Success

His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows weak peripheral pulses. Cardiac examination is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Aortic valve stenosis.

The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue, along with the physical examination findings of weak peripheral pulses and a cardiac examination that likely shows a harsh systolic murmur, are consistent with aortic valve stenosis. The patient's age, smoking history, and hypertension also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis.",Success
A 56-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 1 week after a temporal artery biopsy was performed to evaluate headache and blurry vision. He has a 12-year history of hypertension treated with lisinopril. Results of the testing show decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this finding?,C,"The correct answer is D. Decreased production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate.

The patient's symptoms of headache and blurry vision, along with the temporal artery biopsy, suggest a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis. The decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells are likely due to the decreased production of nitric oxide (NO), which is synthesized from arginine. NO stimulates the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), a secondary messenger that causes vasodilation. Therefore, decreased NO production would lead to decreased cGMP production.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the decreased arginine concentrations:

A. Increased binding of calcium to calmodulin would increase smooth muscle contraction, not affect arginine concentrations.

B. Increased phosphorylation of myosin would increase smooth muscle contraction, not affect arginine concentrations.

C. Increased production of nitric oxide would increase cGMP production, not decrease arginine concentrations.

E. Decreased concentration of bradykinin, a vasodilator, would not directly affect arginine concentrations or NO production.",Success
"While traveling abroad a physician is asked to attend a meeting regarding healthcare in the region. The rate of chlamydial infection is exceptionally high in the area, and the local government is wanting to test a new treatment for these infections. To test the new therapy, the physician is asked to oversee the operations of testing this new treatment. When asking what this would entail, the officials tell the physician that they plan to infect the local prison population with chlamydia and then test the new treatment on these individuals. Which of the following is the best response from the physician?",D,"The correct answer is D. “I can not help you due to the ethical principle of nonmaleficence.”

The ethical principle of nonmaleficence is the principle of ""do no harm."" In this scenario, intentionally infecting the prison population with chlamydia would cause harm to the individuals involved, which violates this principle. The physician should refuse to participate in the proposed study because it involves harming innocent people, even if it's for the purpose of testing a new treatment.

Autonomy (Option A) refers to the right of individuals to make their own decisions, which is not directly relevant in this scenario. Justice (Option C) refers to the fair distribution of benefits and burdens, which is also not directly applicable here. Beneficence (Option E) refers to the principle of doing good, but in this case, the proposed study would cause harm, not good.",Success
"A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 7-day history of progressively worsening shortness of breath. She has a history of asthma and has frequent exacerbations despite receiving maximal medical therapy. Physical examination shows scattered expiratory wheezing. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 9,800/mm3 (13% eosinophils) and elevated serum concentration of immunoglobulin E. An x-ray of the chest shows thickened bronchial walls and perihilar opacities. Sputum culture shows scattered septate hyphae that branch at 45 degrees. Which of the following is most likely to be increased in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. IL-4.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), a condition characterized by an allergic reaction to Aspergillus fungi in the lungs. The presence of eosinophils, elevated IgE levels, and septate hyphae in the sputum culture support this diagnosis.

IL-4 is a cytokine that promotes the production of IgE and is involved in the allergic response. In ABPA, IL-4 levels are typically increased, contributing to the allergic inflammation and eosinophilic response.

The other options are not directly related to ABPA or the allergic response:

A. IL-28 is involved in antiviral responses and is not typically associated with ABPA.

B. C5a is a component of the complement system and is involved in inflammation, but it is not specific to ABPA.

"A 29-year-old G1P0 female presents at 22 weeks gestation for her first prenatal care appointment. Physical exam demonstrates a uterine size greater than expected for her gestational age and taut, shiny skin with scattered striae on her abdomen. Ultrasound examination of the fetus reveals 2.5 L of amniotic fluid (normal 1.5-2.0 L) with an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 34 (normal AFI 20-25). Which of the following fetal abnormalities or dysfunctions could have contributed to these abnormal ultrasound findings?",C,"The correct answer is C. Duodenal atresia.

The symptoms described, including a uterine size greater than expected for gestational age, taut and shiny skin with scattered striae on the abdomen, and excessive amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios), are consistent with a diagnosis of polyhydramnios. The ultrasound finding of 2.5 L of amniotic fluid and an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 34 also support this diagnosis.

Polyhydramnios can be caused by various fetal abnormalities or dysfunctions, including gastrointestinal obstruction, such as duodenal atresia. In this condition, the fetus is unable to swallow amniotic fluid properly, leading to an accumulation of fluid.

The other options are not directly related to polyhydramnios:

A. Renal agenesis would likely cause oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid) rather than polyhydramnios.

B. Pulmonary hypoplasia is not typically associated with polyhydramnios.

D. Posterior urethral valve would likely cause oligohydramnios rather than polyhydramnios.

E. Polycystic kidney disease may cause oligohydramnios or normal amniotic fluid levels, but it is not typically associated with polyhydramnios.",Success
"A 68-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with chest pain. She reports sudden severe and crushing substernal chest pain that started 1 hour ago. Her past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and a prior myocardial infarction requiring a coronary artery bypass graft 2 years ago. She takes aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, spironolactone, atorvastatin, and insulin. She is retired and lives a sedentary lifestyle at home. Her temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 109/68 mmHg, pulse is 118/min, and respirations are 24/min. Before being able to start the physical examination, the patient loses consciousness. Her pulse is palpable but weak. Her blood pressure is now 88/50 mmHg and pulse is 130/min. Her skin is pale, cold, and clammy. An electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in leads I, aVL, V3, V4, V5, and V6. A medication that primarily stimulates which of the following receptors would be most appropriate to improve the hemodynamic status of this patient?",C,"The correct answer is A. Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor.

The patient is experiencing cardiogenic shock, as evidenced by the loss of consciousness, weak pulse, and low blood pressure. To improve the hemodynamic status of this patient, a medication that increases peripheral vascular resistance and blood pressure is needed. Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors are primarily responsible for vasoconstriction, which would help to increase blood pressure and improve perfusion to vital organs.

In this scenario, an alpha-1 agonist such as phenylephrine or norepinephrine would be an appropriate choice to improve the patient's hemodynamic status.",Success
"A 4-year-old child is rushed to the emergency department after developing sudden abdominal pain followed by nausea, vomiting, and dark, almost black-colored stool. Prior to the onset of symptoms, he was seen playing with his mother’s purse containing a bottle of vitamin supplements, which she takes for chronic microcytic anemia. Which of the following medications is the treatment for this patient's intoxication?",C,"The correct answer is C. Deferoxamine.

The symptoms described, including sudden abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and dark, almost black-colored stool, are consistent with iron poisoning. The fact that the child was playing with the mother's purse containing vitamin supplements, which she takes for chronic microcytic anemia, suggests that the child ingested iron supplements.

Deferoxamine is a specific chelating agent used to treat iron poisoning. It binds to iron in the bloodstream, allowing it to be excreted in the urine, and is the treatment of choice for severe iron intoxication.",Success

Her temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 184/111 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with normal strength and sensation in the patient's upper and lower extremities. The patient's memory is intact and her speech seems normal and fluent. Her gait is stable with no ataxia. An initial head CT demonstrates diffuse atrophy which is consistent with previous head CT scans. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is C. Echocardiogram.

The patient's symptoms of slurred speech and arm weakness, which resolved on their own, are consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Given the patient's history of atrial fibrillation, the most likely cause of the TIA is an embolic event from the heart. An echocardiogram is the best next step in management to evaluate the patient's heart and identify any potential sources of embolism.

Alteplase (A) is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient's symptoms have already resolved and thrombolysis is typically used in acute ischemic strokes, not TIAs.

A CT angiogram (B) may be useful in evaluating the patient's cerebral vasculature, but it is not the next best step in management.

Heparin (D) may be considered for anticoagulation, but it is not the next best step in management, and the patient's atrial fibrillation should be further evaluated with an echocardiogram before initiating anticoagulation.

His temperature is 97.9°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 144/94 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a man who seems unable to smile with dysarthric speech. He takes shallow and weak breaths on pulmonary exam. The patient demonstrates 3/5 strength with diminished reflexes in his upper extremities. The patient is subsequently intubated. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Antitoxin.

The patient's symptoms, including blurry vision, difficulty speaking and swallowing, weakness of facial muscles, and shortness of breath, are consistent with botulism. The patient's occupation as a farmer and canner, along with the recent diarrhea and cough, suggest that he may have ingested contaminated food. Botulism is typically treated with antitoxin, which can help neutralize the toxin and improve symptoms.

Atropine (B) is not a treatment for botulism. Neostigmine (C) is used to treat myasthenia gravis, not botulism.

A 79-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of difficulty starting urination and a vague sensation of fullness in the pelvis. Pelvic speculum examination in the lithotomy position shows a pink structure at the vaginal introitus that protrudes from the anterior vaginal wall when the patient is asked to cough. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?,C,"The correct answer is C. Cystocele.

A cystocele is a type of pelvic organ prolapse where the bladder bulges into the vagina, causing a bulge or protrusion at the vaginal introitus. The symptoms described, such as difficulty starting urination and a sensation of fullness in the pelvis, are consistent with a cystocele. The physical examination finding of a pink structure protruding from the anterior vaginal wall when the patient coughs also supports this diagnosis.

Uterine prolapse (A) would typically involve the uterus protruding into the vagina, not the anterior vaginal wall. Vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma (B) is a rare type of cancer that would not typically present with these symptoms. Rectocele (D) is a type of pelvic organ prolapse involving the rectum, which would not cause a bulge at the anterior vaginal wall.

She is not currently on any medications. Clinical examination shows mild tenderness in the suprapubic region, and there is no organomegaly. Findings on colonoscopy include patchy erythema and ulceration in the cecum, ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon. Mucosal biopsy shows colonic crypts with lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrates. What is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is A. Ulcerative colitis.

The symptoms and findings in this case are consistent with ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The patient's symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and blood in the stool, along with the colonoscopy findings of patchy erythema and ulceration in multiple segments of the colon, support this diagnosis. The mucosal biopsy showing lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrates in the colonic crypts is also consistent with ulcerative colitis.

Crohn's disease (option B) is another type of IBD, but it typically involves the entire thickness of the bowel wall and can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, whereas ulcerative colitis primarily affects the mucosa and is limited to the colon.

Acute infective colitis (option C) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms have been ongoing for a month, and there is no mention of a recent infectious episode.

Pseudomembranous colitis (option D) is a type of colitis caused by Clostridioides difficile infection, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

His extremities remain cold despite having the ambient room temperature increased to 80°F (26.7°C). What is the most likely cause of his presentation?",A,"The correct answer is B. Cervical spinal cord transection.

The patient's presentation is consistent with neurogenic shock, which is caused by a spinal cord injury. The clues that point to this diagnosis are:

* The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, which indicates severe neurological impairment
* The lack of tachycardia despite hypotension, which is unusual in the setting of hemorrhagic shock
* The presence of cold extremities despite aggressive resuscitation and a warm ambient temperature
* The low ScvO2 (central venous oxygen saturation) of 39%, which suggests inadequate tissue perfusion
* The absence of active bleeding or other obvious causes of shock

Cervical spinal cord transection can cause neurogenic shock, which is characterized by hypotension, bradycardia, and decreased peripheral resistance.

She drinks a glass of wine every night and does not smoke. She has a history of hypertension and osteoarthritis. She does not take any medications. She has never traveled out of the country. She works as an accountant. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. Lungs are clear to auscultation. An x-ray of the chest shows a 2.5-cm nodule with irregular borders at the apex of the left lung with no mediastinal or hilar enlargement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is D. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.

The patient's symptoms, such as hemoptysis, nonproductive cough, fatigue, and weight loss, are consistent with lung cancer. The chest x-ray showing a 2.5-cm nodule with irregular borders at the apex of the left lung also supports this diagnosis. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of non-small cell lung cancer that is commonly found in the upper lobes of the lungs, which is consistent with the location of the nodule in this patient. Additionally, squamous cell carcinoma is more common in African Americans and is often associated with hemoptysis.",Success
"A 70-year-old man with hyperlipidemia and hypertension returns to his cardiologist for ongoing blood pressure management. He reports feeling fine with no trouble with his medications. He exercises regularly and sleeps well without snoring or daytime somnolence. His blood pressure measurements in the past have ranged from 160 - 170/80 - 100 mmHg. Today, his pressure is 150/100 mmHg with a pulse of 65/min while on hydrochlorothiazide and ramipril. Physical exam reveals a II/VI early systolic murmur with split S2 is appreciated at the right upper sternal border. There is unremarkable carotid, renal, or abdominal bruits. What is the most common cause of his hypertension?",C,"The correct answer is C. Stiffening of the aorta.

The patient's blood pressure measurements, which show a wide pulse pressure (150-100 mmHg), suggest that the patient has a non-compliant or stiff aorta, which is a common cause of hypertension in older adults. The physical exam finding of a II/VI early systolic murmur with split S2 at the right upper sternal border is also consistent with aortic stiffness.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings:

A. Primary hyperaldosteronism would typically cause hypokalemia and a more severe hypertension, which is not mentioned in the case.

B. Hypothyroidism is not typically associated with hypertension.

D. Obstructive sleep apnea is not suggested by the patient's report of regular exercise and good sleep quality without snoring or daytime somnolence.

E. Aortic stenosis would typically cause a harsh, late-peaking systolic murmur, which is not described in the case.",Success
An 11-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. He is growing along with the 75th percentile and meeting all milestones. Physical examination shows a poorly rugated scrotum. The palpation of the scrotum shows only 1 testicle. A 2nd testicle is palpated in the inguinal canal. The examination of the penis shows a normal urethral meatus. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,E,"The correct answer is E. Orchiopexy.

The patient is an 11-month-old boy with an undescended testicle (cryptorchidism) that is palpable in the inguinal canal. Orchiopexy, a surgical procedure to move the testicle into the scrotum, is the most appropriate next step in management. This is recommended to reduce the risk of testicular torsion, infertility, and testicular cancer.",Success

A multi-specialty physician practice is meeting to determine which compensation scheme would best serve the practice and its patient population. Which of the following are true in regards to physician compensation?,C,"The correct answers are:

C. Fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality
E. Capitation may provide perverse incentives to decrease preventive medicine visits

Explanation:

* A is incorrect because capitation actually poses the most financial risk to physicians, as they receive a fixed payment per patient per month, regardless of the number of services provided.
* B is incorrect because fee-for-service pays physicians a set amount of money per unit of service (e.g., per visit, per procedure), not per unit of time.
* D is incorrect because fee-for-service actually poses less financial risk to physicians, as they are paid for each service provided, rather than receiving a fixed payment per patient.
* C is correct because fee-for-service can incentivize physicians to provide more services, even if they are not necessary, in order to increase revenue.
* E is correct because capitation can incentivize physicians to reduce preventive medicine visits, as they are paid a fixed amount per patient, regardless of the services provided. This can lead to a focus on acute care rather than preventive care.",Success
"A 29-year-old woman presents to her primary care doctor for a prenatal visit. She has just learned that she is pregnant and estimates she is approximately 6 weeks pregnant given the timing of her last menstrual cycle. She has a history of recurrent fetal loss. In total, she has had 4 miscarriages between the gestational ages of 8 and 15 weeks. She has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and has had several DVTs in the past and a clot in her lung once. Her vitals today are unremarkable. She is asking if there are any treatments she should receive to prevent fetal loss. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Aspirin and heparin.

This patient has a history of recurrent fetal loss, systemic lupus erythematosus, and thrombotic events (DVTs and pulmonary embolism). She is at high risk for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is a condition characterized by recurrent thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity in the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies.

The most appropriate management for this patient is to start her on aspirin and heparin therapy to prevent further thrombotic events and reduce the risk of fetal loss. Aspirin is used to prevent platelet activation and thrombosis, while heparin is used to prevent venous thromboembolism.

Option A, aspirin alone, is not sufficient to prevent thrombotic events in this high-risk patient. Option C, aspirin and warfarin, is not recommended during pregnancy due to the teratogenic effects of warfarin. Option D, no treatment indicated, is incorrect given the patient's high-risk profile. Option E, rivaroxaban, is a direct oral anticoagulant that is not recommended during pregnancy due to limited safety data.",Success
"A 17-year-old girl is brought to the physician because she has not attained menarche. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 168 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 63 kg (139 lb); BMI is 22.3 kg/m2. Examination shows normal breast development. Scant axillary hair is present. Abdominal examination shows a firm, nontender left inguinal mass. Pelvic examination shows a blind vaginal pouch. Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is B. 5-α reductase deficiency.

The patient's symptoms, including the presence of a blind vaginal pouch, scant axillary hair, and a firm, nontender left inguinal mass, are consistent with 5-α reductase deficiency, a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the reproductive system. The inguinal mass is likely a testis, and the patient's phenotype is likely to be that of a male pseudohermaphrodite.

Mullerian duct agenesis (Option A) would not explain the presence of a blind vaginal pouch or the inguinal mass. Sex chromosome mosaicism (Option C) or sex chromosome monosomy (Option D) would not typically present with a blind vaginal pouch and a testis in the inguinal canal. Androgen insensitivity (Option E) would not explain the presence of a testis in the inguinal canal.",Success
"A 68-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of worsening fatigue and weight loss. He is especially concerned about a recent episode in which he noticed a blurring of his vision and headache; he also notes that his “memory is not as good as it used to be,” which his wife confirms. Physical exam is notable only for pallor and general weakness. Laboratory studies reveal anemia as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) reveals a sharp, narrow spike of monoclonal IgM; serum IgM concentration is 6.3 g/dL. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?",C,"The correct answer is C. Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia.

The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, weight loss, and neurological symptoms (blurring of vision, headache, and memory impairment), are consistent with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. The laboratory findings, including anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a sharp, narrow spike of monoclonal IgM on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), also support this diagnosis. The high serum IgM concentration (6.3 g/dL) is also characteristic of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.

IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a possible precursor to Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, but it is not typically associated with symptoms or anemia. Multiple myeloma is a possibility, but it is more commonly associated with bone lesions and lytic bone disease, which are not mentioned in this case. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are also possibilities, but they are less likely given the specific laboratory findings and symptoms described.",Success

"A 40-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe left upper quadrant pain (duration 3 hours, stabbing quality, 10/10 on the pain scale). Past medical history is significant for sickle cell anemia. Physical examination is significant for severe tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant. Significant splenomegaly is also noted. The patient is admitted to the hospital for close observation and placed on deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis as part of a routine protocol. Laboratory findings drawn sometime after admission demonstrate a normal prothrombin time (PT) and elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Which of the following factors is most directly affected by the DVT prophylaxis?",D,"The correct answer is C. VIIa.

The patient is on DVT prophylaxis, which typically involves the use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin. Heparin works by activating antithrombin III, which then inactivates factor Xa and thrombin (IIa). The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is sensitive to the effects of heparin and will be elevated in the presence of therapeutic levels of heparin.

Factor VIIa is not directly affected by heparin. Factor VIIa is involved in the extrinsic pathway of coagulation and is not a target of heparin's anticoagulant activity.

The other options are not correct because:

* Factor VII is involved in the extrinsic pathway of coagulation and is not directly affected by heparin.
* Factor XIIa is involved in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and is not directly affected by heparin.
* Factor X is inactivated by antithrombin III in the presence of heparin, but it is not directly affected by heparin itself.

On exam, his temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 116/74 mmHg, pulse is 64/min, and respirations are 12/min. His viral load is undetectable on his current regimen, and his blood count, electrolytes, and liver function tests have all been within normal limits. In order to consider maraviroc for therapy, a tropism assay needs to be performed. Which of the following receptors is affected by the use of maraviroc?",B,"The correct answer is B. gp120.

Maraviroc is a CCR5 antagonist, which means it blocks the CCR5 receptor on the surface of CD4 cells. HIV-1 uses the gp120 protein to bind to the CCR5 receptor, allowing the virus to enter the cell. By blocking the CCR5 receptor, maraviroc prevents the virus from entering the cell and replicating. A tropism assay is necessary to determine if the patient's HIV-1 strain uses the CCR5 receptor, as maraviroc is only effective against CCR5-tropic viruses.",Success
"A 16-year-old female presents to her physician’s office after noticing a round lump in her left breast 2 months ago. She reports that the lump seemed to enlarge and became tender just preceding her last 2 menses. It is otherwise painless, and the patient denies any discharge or skin changes. She has no past medical history but her grandmother, age 72, was just diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The patient is an avid softball player at her high school and denies alcohol, smoking, or illicit drug use. On exam, the breasts appear symmetric and normal. A 3-cm round, mobile mass is palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There is slight tenderness to deep palpation of the mass. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy on either side. Which of the following is the most likely outcome of this patient’s condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. This mass will most likely decrease in size or disappear over time.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a benign breast mass, likely a fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas are common in young women and are often tender and mobile. They can fluctuate in size with hormonal changes, which is why the patient noticed an increase in size preceding her menses. Fibroadenomas are typically benign and can resolve on their own over time, which is why option D is the most likely outcome.",Success
"A 22-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a headache. She has had episodic headaches like this in the past and states that her headache today is severe, worse when laying down, and not responding to ibuprofen. She also reports a transient episode of vision loss and current blurry vision. She states she has a ringing in her ears as well. The patient has a past medical history of headaches, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and constipation. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 149/92 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is not remarkable and an initial head CT is within normal limits. Which of the following is the best next step in management for the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is D. MRI.

The patient's symptoms, including a severe headache, transient vision loss, blurry vision, and ringing in her ears, are consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri. IIH is a condition in which there is increased pressure in the brain, often due to excess cerebrospinal fluid.

The patient's past medical history of obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and constipation are also risk factors for IIH. The normal head CT rules out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a tumor or bleeding.

The next step in management would be to perform an MRI to confirm the diagnosis of IIH and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms. An MRI can show signs of increased intracranial pressure, such as flattening of the posterior sclera, empty sella, and transverse sinus stenosis.

The other options are not correct because:

A. 100% oxygen is not a treatment for IIH.

B. Ibuprofen has already been tried and was not effective.

C. Lumbar puncture may be necessary to measure the opening pressure and collect cerebrospinal fluid for analysis, but it is not the best next step in management.

E. Tissue plasminogen activator is a thrombolytic agent used to treat acute ischemic stroke, and it is not indicated for the treatment of IIH.",Success
A 28-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of amenorrhea. Her last period occurred 4 months ago but she has not had sex in the last year and home pregnancy tests have come back negative. She first started having periods at age 13 and her periods have been unremarkable up until they stopped 4 months ago. Her past medical history is significant for radius and ulnar forearm fractures that she sustained in a car crash 3 months ago. She didn't see the car coming and has had increasing difficulty noticing objects in her peripheral vision. She also notes having recurrent headaches 5 months ago. Otherwise she has been healthy with no previous pregnancies. Physical exam reveals galactorrhea and temporal field visual defects. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for this patient's amenorrhea?,B,"The correct answer is B. Inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone release.

The patient's symptoms, including amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and temporal field visual defects, are consistent with a diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia, likely caused by a pituitary tumor. The tumor is compressing the optic chiasm, causing the visual field defects, and is also inhibiting the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), leading to amenorrhea. The galactorrhea is due to the excessive production of prolactin, which is also inhibiting GnRH release. The patient's history of headaches and peripheral vision loss also support this diagnosis.",Success

He is noted to have jaundice, palpable firm liver, mild splenomegaly, and shifting dullness consistent with the presence of ascites. Liver function tests are as follows:
Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  97 U/L
Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 40 U/L
Serum albumin 2.5 g/dL
Total bilirubin 3 mg/dL
Prothrombin time 20 seconds
Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's illness?",C,"The correct answer is C. Substance abuse.

The patient's presentation with hematemesis, jaundice, palpable firm liver, mild splenomegaly, and ascites suggests liver cirrhosis. The laboratory results, including elevated bilirubin, low albumin, and prolonged prothrombin time, are also consistent with liver cirrhosis. The AST:ALT ratio of 2.4 (97:40) is suggestive of alcoholic liver disease, which is a common cause of cirrhosis in patients with a history of substance abuse.",Success
"A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department for a cough and fatigue.

His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals crackles on pulmonary exam and S4 on cardiac auscultation. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",E,"The correct answer is D. Ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and admission to the intensive care unit.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), which is a serious infection that requires prompt treatment. The patient's confusion, tachycardia, and hypotension also suggest that he may be septic, which increases his risk of mortality.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend that patients with CAP who are at risk of mortality, such as those with sepsis, be treated with a combination of antibiotics that cover both typical and atypical pathogens. Ceftriaxone is a beta-lactam antibiotic that covers typical pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, while azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that covers atypical pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila.

Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is also necessary due to the patient's sepsis and risk of mortality. The ICU can provide close monitoring and supportive care, such as oxygen therapy, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressors, if needed.

Option A is incorrect because azithromycin alone may not provide adequate coverage for typical pathogens, and admission to the medical floor may not provide the level of care that the patient requires. Option B is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings suggest that he requires hospitalization, not discharge. Option C is incorrect because moxifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that may not provide adequate coverage for typical pathogens, and the patient's sepsis requires treatment with a beta-lactam antibiotic. Option E is incorrect because moxifloxacin alone may not provide adequate coverage for atypical pathogens, and admission to the medical floor may not provide the level of care that the patient requires.",Success
"A 72-year-old man in a nursing home was brought to the emergency department with right hand and leg weakness for 1 hour. There has been a gradual increase in the degree of weakness.

On examination, the reflexes are hypertonic and the Babinski reflex is positive. The CT scan is shown. What is the most likely pathologic change?",B,"The correct answer is B. Liquefactive necrosis.

The CT scan shows a large hypodense area in the left hemisphere, consistent with a cerebral infarction. The patient's symptoms, including right hand and leg weakness, disorientation, and positive Babinski reflex, are also consistent with a left middle cerebral artery stroke.

Liquefactive necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in the brain, particularly in response to ischemia or infarction. It is characterized by the breakdown of brain tissue, leading to the formation of a liquid-filled cavity. This type of necrosis is commonly seen in cerebral infarctions, such as the one shown in the CT scan.

The other options are not directly related to the pathology of a cerebral infarction:

A. Gangrenous necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in response to ischemia, but it is typically seen in peripheral tissues, such as the limbs.

C. Caseous necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in response to infection, particularly tuberculosis.

D. Fibrinoid necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in response to immune-mediated injury, such as in autoimmune disorders.

A bone marrow aspiration is ordered but after multiple attempts, they are unable to obtain an adequate bone marrow sample. A peripheral blood smear would likely reveal cells that stain with which of the following stains?",D,"The correct answer is D. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia, a rare type of blood cancer. The inability to obtain an adequate bone marrow sample is consistent with this diagnosis, as the bone marrow is often fibrotic and difficult to aspirate in hairy cell leukemia.

Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) is a specific stain that is used to diagnose hairy cell leukemia. It is a sensitive and specific marker for hairy cell leukemia, and a positive TRAP stain is often used to confirm the diagnosis.

Prussian Blue (A) is a stain used to detect iron in tissues, and is not specific for hairy cell leukemia. Ziehl-Neelsen (B) is a stain used to detect acid-fast bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

The patient's symptoms, including fatigue, lethargy, and epigastric pain after eating, are consistent with gastritis and anemia. The laboratory studies showing decreased serum hemoglobin levels and increased serum gastrin levels support this diagnosis. The photomicrograph of the biopsy specimen taken from the gastric antrum likely shows atrophic gastritis, which is characterized by the destruction of parietal cells. Parietal cells are responsible for producing intrinsic factor, which is necessary for vitamin B12 absorption. The destruction of parietal cells leads to a deficiency in intrinsic factor, resulting in vitamin B12 deficiency and subsequent anemia.",Success
A 72-year-old anthropologist with long-standing hypertension visits your office for a routine exam. You notice an abnormality on his laboratory results caused by his regimen of captopril and triamterene. What abnormality did you most likely find?,B,"The correct answer is B. Hyperkalemia.

Captopril is an ACE inhibitor, which can increase potassium levels in the blood by reducing aldosterone production and increasing potassium reabsorption in the kidneys. Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic, which also increases potassium levels in the blood. The combination of these two medications increases the risk of hyperkalemia (elevated potassium levels).",Success
"A 56-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband because of increasing confusion, generalized fatigue, and irritability for the past week. She has been unable to recall her husband's name or their address. She has had insomnia and daytime sleepiness during this period. Her last bowel movement was 3 days ago. One month ago, she underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portal shunt (TIPS) placement. She has alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Current medications include spironolactone and furosemide. She used to drink over a pint of vodka daily but quit 2 months ago. She is oriented to place and person. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 102/64 mm Hg. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. There are several telangiectasias over the chest and back. Palmar erythema is present. The abdomen is mildly distended and nontender. Shifting dullness is present. There is a flapping tremor of both hands when outstretched and dorsiflexed. Neurologic examination shows no other focal findings. She completes the number connection test slower than the age-normalized standard. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Administer lactulose.

The patient's symptoms, such as confusion, fatigue, irritability, insomnia, and difficulty recalling her husband's name and address, are consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver cirrhosis. The presence of a flapping tremor (asterixis) and slow completion of the number connection test also support this diagnosis.

Lactulose is a medication that is commonly used to treat hepatic encephalopathy. It works by reducing the production of ammonia in the gut, which is a toxin that can contribute to hepatic encephalopathy.

Reversal of TIPS (Option A) may not be necessary at this point, and paracentesis (Option B) is not indicated for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. Ceftriaxone (Option C) is an antibiotic that may be used to treat infections, but there is no indication of infection in this patient. Vitamin B1 (Option E) is important for patients with a history of alcoholism, but it is not the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's symptoms.",Success
"A 50-year-old woman is brought to the office by her daughter with a chief complaint of finger pain in her left hand. She is slightly confused and can’t remember when the pain started. Her daughter states that the pain has been present for approximately one month. She expresses concern that her mother has been progressively more confused during the past week. She reports that her mother also has had worsening nausea for several months. The patient’s vital signs are heart rate 92/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), and blood pressure 120/86 mm Hg. Upon physical examination, the patient reports pain when the fingers of the left hand are palpated, and small palpable tumors are visible on the fingers. An X-ray image of the left-hand shows thin bones with brown tumors and osteolysis of the distal phalanges. What is the most likely cause for this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Hyperparathyroidism.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with hyperparathyroidism, a condition characterized by excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The symptoms include:

* Finger pain: due to osteolysis (bone resorption) and brown tumors (collections of osteoclasts and fibrous tissue) on the fingers
* Confusion: due to hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels) which can cause neurological symptoms
* Nausea: due to hypercalcemia
* Palpable tumors on the fingers: brown tumors
* X-ray findings: thin bones, osteolysis, and brown tumors on the distal phalanges

Hyperparathyroidism can cause osteolysis, bone resorption, and brown tumors, which are characteristic features of this condition. The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings as well as hyperparathyroidism.",Success
"A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of lightheadedness, intermittent headaches, and easy bruising. Five months ago, she was treated for an episode of thrombophlebitis. Physical examination shows multiple bruises on her limbs. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 900,000/mm3 and elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid. Treatment with a medication is begun that is also used in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the beneficial effect of this drug in sickle cell disease?",B,"The correct answer is B. Increase in circulating fetal hemoglobin.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of polycythemia vera, a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an overproduction of blood cells. The medication used to treat this condition is hydroxyurea, which is also used to treat sickle cell disease.

In sickle cell disease, hydroxyurea increases the production of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which can help to reduce the severity of the disease by inhibiting the sickling of red blood cells. This is the mechanism by which hydroxyurea is beneficial in sickle cell disease.",Success
"Candida is injected into the skin of a 38-year-old female patient. Forty-eight hours later, there is a 14 mm raised, slightly hardened area at the injection site. What type of hypersensitivity reaction has occurred and what cell type plays a role?",D,"The correct answer is D. Type IV hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells.

The description of a 14 mm raised, slightly hardened area at the injection site 48 hours after Candida injection is consistent with a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, which is a type of Type IV hypersensitivity reaction. This type of reaction is mediated by CD4+ T cells, which recognize and respond to the Candida antigen, leading to the recruitment of immune cells and the formation of a localized inflammatory response.",Success
"On routine screening, a 62-year-old man is found to have positive fecal occult blood tests. He is asymptomatic, but his father died of large intestinal cancer. Abdominal and rectal exams are normal. A colonoscopy subsequently reveals a polyp in the descending colon but no other abnormalities. Excisional biopsy of the polyp shows 75% tubular architecture. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Adenomatous polyp.

The presence of 75% tubular architecture on excisional biopsy of the polyp is consistent with an adenomatous polyp, which is a type of polyp that has a high risk of progressing to colorectal cancer. Adenomatous polyps are the most common type of polyp found in the colon and are often asymptomatic, but can cause bleeding, which would explain the positive fecal occult blood test.",Success
"A 20-year-old male college student presents to the emergency room at 4 AM in the morning with complaints of abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for the past 2 hours. He was studying for his exams last night when he became hungry and ate some food from the afternoon after heating it for a while. He says that his symptoms began an hour after he ate the food. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 90/78 mm Hg. A physical examination is within normal limits except for signs of dehydration. What is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Bacillus cereus infection.

The patient's symptoms, including abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, are consistent with a foodborne illness. The fact that the symptoms began within 1-2 hours of eating the reheated food suggests a preformed toxin-mediated illness, which is characteristic of Bacillus cereus infection. Bacillus cereus is a common cause of food poisoning, particularly in reheated rice and other starchy foods. The patient's physical examination is within normal limits except for signs of dehydration, which is consistent with a mild to moderate case of food poisoning.",Success
"A 79-year-old woman presents to her physician complaining of a persistent non-productive cough and dyspnea after contracting a cold in the past month.

During a review of symptoms, she described a month-long trip to St. Louis, Missouri, to visit family. At the physician’s office, her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. A focused chest exam reveals mild crepitus on the right side. A chest X-ray shows a cavitary lesion in the right lung which is confirmed on chest computed tomography (CT). A lung biopsy is performed to rule out cancer and reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with oval yeast in macrophages. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Histoplasmosis.

The patient's symptoms, such as a persistent non-productive cough and dyspnea, and the presence of a cavitary lesion in the right lung, are consistent with histoplasmosis. The fact that the patient recently visited St. Louis, Missouri, which is an endemic area for histoplasmosis, further supports this diagnosis. The lung biopsy findings of necrotic granulomatous inflammation with oval yeast in macrophages are also characteristic of histoplasmosis.

Coccidioidomycosis (A) is more commonly associated with the southwestern United States, and the patient's travel history does not suggest exposure to this region. Blastomycosis (B) can cause similar symptoms, but it is more commonly associated with skin lesions, which are not mentioned in this case. Sporotrichosis (C) is a fungal infection that typically affects the skin, and onychomycosis (E) is a fungal infection of the nails, neither of which fit the patient's symptoms and biopsy findings.",Success
"A 14-year-old girl comes to the physician because she has not yet had her period. She is at the 10th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. Examination shows a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, a low posterior hairline, forearms angled 20° away from the body when fully extended, and shortened fourth metacarpals bilaterally. Sexual development is Tanner stage 1. Which of the following statements about this patient's fertility is most accurate?",A,"The correct answer is A. Pregnancy success rate with donor oocytes is similar to patients with primary ovarian failure.

The patient's physical characteristics, such as a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, a low posterior hairline, forearms angled away from the body, and shortened fourth metacarpals, are consistent with Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females and is characterized by short stature, ovarian dysgenesis, and infertility.

Women with Turner syndrome are typically infertile due to ovarian failure, and their chances of conceiving naturally are very low. However, with the use of donor oocytes (eggs from a donor), they can achieve pregnancy through in vitro fertilization (IVF). The pregnancy success rate with donor oocytes is similar to that of patients with primary ovarian failure, which is around 50-60% per cycle.

The other options are incorrect:

B. Administration of gonadotropins will not increase the chances of conceiving in a patient with Turner syndrome, as the ovaries are not functional.

C. Impaired tubal ciliary function is not a characteristic of Turner syndrome, and it would not prevent natural fertilization in any case.

D. The majority of patients with Turner syndrome do not become pregnant without medical assistance due to their infertility.

E. Functional gametes (sperm or eggs) are not present in patients with Turner syndrome, and the absence of a uterus is not a characteristic of the syndrome. Surrogacy may be an option for some patients, but it is not necessary in this case.",Success
"An investigator is studying traumatic knee joint injuries in college athletes. Images and tissue samples are collected from 4 athletes with cartilaginous injury and 4 athletes with bone fractures. After 8 weeks, the athletes with bone fractures show almost complete resolution, while the athletes with cartilaginous injuries show only minimal signs of healing. The investigator hypothesizes that this is due to the absence of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration. Transplant of which of the following tissues would most likely promote healing in the group with cartilaginous injury?",A,"The correct answer is A. Perichondrium.

Perichondrium is a layer of connective tissue that surrounds cartilage and contains progenitor cells that can differentiate into chondrocytes, which are the cells responsible for producing cartilage matrix. Transplanting perichondrium into the area of cartilaginous injury could provide a source of progenitor cells to promote healing and matrix regeneration.

The other options are not correct because:

* Proteoglycans (B) are a type of molecule found in cartilage matrix, but they do not contain progenitor cells.
* Chondronectin (C) is a protein involved in cartilage development, but it is not a source of progenitor cells.
* Osteoblasts (D) are cells involved in bone formation, not cartilage regeneration.
* Mature chondrocytes (E) may not be able to proliferate and differentiate to the same extent as progenitor cells, and may not be able to promote healing as effectively.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of increasing weakness and numbness of the upper extremities for 5 days. During the past 2 days, she has had urinary incontinence not related to sneezing or laughing. Last summer, she had weakness and numbness of her right lower extremity that was worse when she was outside; she regained her strength 3 weeks later. She has no history of serious illness. She has had 10 male sexual partners in her lifetime and uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows an impaired tandem gait. There is mild spasticity and muscle strength is decreased in both upper extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ bilaterally. The abdominal reflex is absent. Muscle strength in the right lower extremity is mildly decreased. Sensation to vibration and fine touch is decreased over the upper extremities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. MRI of the brain and spine.

The patient's symptoms, including weakness and numbness in the upper extremities, urinary incontinence, and abnormal reflexes, suggest a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis. The patient's history of a previous episode of weakness and numbness in the right lower extremity that resolved on its own also supports this diagnosis.

An MRI of the brain and spine is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis, as it can help to identify lesions in the central nervous system that are consistent with demyelination.

Antinuclear antibody testing (Option A) is not relevant to this patient's symptoms and would not be a useful diagnostic test.

Muscle biopsy (Option B) would not be helpful in diagnosing a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system.

Rapid plasma reagin test (Option C) is a test for syphilis, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms.

Lumbar puncture (Option E) may be useful in diagnosing multiple sclerosis, but it would not be the next step in diagnosis. An MRI would be performed first to identify any lesions in the central nervous system.",Success
"A 37-year-old woman presents to your office with heartburn. Following an extensive workup, you diagnose her with a duodenal ulcer secondary to H. pylori infection. You prescribe triple therapy of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of omeprazole?",D,"The correct answer is D. Inhibition of primary active transport.

Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), which works by inhibiting the primary active transport of hydrogen ions (H+) from the parietal cells of the stomach into the gastric lumen. This reduces the production of gastric acid, which helps to heal the duodenal ulcer and alleviate heartburn symptoms.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. SST2 receptor agonist: Omeprazole is not an SST2 receptor agonist. SST2 receptors are involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion, but omeprazole does not act on these receptors.

B. Parasympathetic inhibition: Omeprazole does not inhibit parasympathetic activity. Parasympathetic stimulation can increase gastric acid secretion, but omeprazole's mechanism of action is independent of parasympathetic activity.

C. Reversible block of H2 receptors: Omeprazole is not an H2 receptor antagonist. H2 receptor antagonists, such as ranitidine, work by blocking the action of histamine on parietal cells, reducing gastric acid secretion. Omeprazole, on the other hand, inhibits the proton pump directly.

E. Inhibition of 50S ribosomal subunit: This is the mechanism of action of macrolide antibiotics, such as clarithromycin, which is part of the triple therapy regimen. Omeprazole does not inhibit the 50S ribosomal subunit.",Success

"Two weeks after starting chemotherapy with etoposide, a 66-year-old man with small cell lung cancer comes to the physician because of persistent nausea and vomiting. His symptoms improve significantly after the administration of metoclopramide. This patient's symptoms were most likely due to the effect of chemotherapy on which of the following structures?",E,"The correct answer is E. Area postrema.

Etoposide, a chemotherapeutic agent, can cause nausea and vomiting by stimulating the area postrema, also known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). The CTZ is a region in the brain that is sensitive to chemicals in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and it plays a key role in inducing vomiting in response to toxins. The CTZ is located in the floor of the fourth ventricle and is outside the blood-brain barrier, making it accessible to circulating toxins.

Metoclopramide, an antiemetic medication, works by blocking the dopamine receptors in the CTZ, which helps to reduce nausea and vomiting.

The other options are not directly related to the mechanism of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting:

A. Vestibular nerve: involved in balance and equilibrium, not nausea and vomiting.

B. Intestinal smooth muscle: involved in gut motility, not nausea and vomiting.

C. Vagus nerve: involved in various functions, including gut motility and nausea, but not specifically in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

A 6 cm burn is present on the right arm. His vitals are within normal limits except for mild tachypnea at 21/min. Which of the following diagnostic tests should be conducted first to evaluate this patient?",C,"The correct answer is B. Urine dipstick.

The patient has been struck by a high-voltage power line, which can cause cardiac arrest, muscle damage, and renal damage due to rhabdomyolysis. The patient is experiencing severe pain in the flanks, which suggests possible kidney damage. A urine dipstick is a quick and non-invasive test that can detect the presence of blood or myoglobin in the urine, which would indicate rhabdomyolysis. This test should be conducted first to evaluate the patient's renal function and potential muscle damage.

The other options are not the most appropriate first step in evaluating this patient:

A. FAST ultrasound assessment is used to evaluate for intra-abdominal bleeding, which is not the primary concern in this patient.

C. Urinalysis is a more comprehensive test that can provide more information about the patient's renal function, but it is not as quick or easy to perform as a urine dipstick.

Abdominal exam reveals an obese abdomen without pain in any of the quadrants. Lower extremity pitting edema is noted bilaterally. Which of the following sets of lab values most likely corresponds to this patient's presentation?",C,"The correct answer is C. High BNP, high ADH, low sodium, low potassium.

Here's why:

* High BNP (Brain Natriuretic Peptide): The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings (shortness of breath, bilateral crackles, and bilateral pitting edema) suggest heart failure, which would increase BNP levels.
* High ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone): The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings also suggest volume overload, which would stimulate the release of ADH to retain water and dilute sodium levels.
* Low sodium: The patient's volume overload and heart failure would lead to dilutional hyponatremia (low sodium levels).
* Low potassium: The patient's heart failure and diuretic use (although not mentioned, it's likely given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings) would lead to potassium depletion.

The other options do not fit the patient's presentation:

* A: High potassium is unlikely in heart failure patients, especially with diuretic use.
* B: Low ADH is unlikely in heart failure patients with volume overload.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

The patient presents with symptoms of cholangitis, including fever, right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice. The ultrasound shows a dilated common bile duct, suggesting a bile duct stone. The laboratory results show elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels, consistent with biliary obstruction.

He does not comply with any commands, and it is not possible to freely manipulate his extremities due to rigidity. His mucous membranes are dry. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is B. Heat stroke.

The patient's symptoms, such as undressing in hot weather, altered mental status, high body temperature (104°F), and dry mucous membranes, are consistent with heat stroke. The patient's rigidity and non-compliance with commands may be related to the heat stroke, rather than a primary neurological or psychiatric condition.

While the patient has a history of substance abuse and may have been experiencing psychotic symptoms (paranoia, aggression), the primary diagnosis is likely heat stroke, which can cause altered mental status, rigidity, and autonomic instability.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (D) is a possible complication of antipsychotic medication, but it is less likely in this scenario, given the patient's recent exposure to heat and lack of prior antipsychotic use. Malignant hyperthermia (C) is a rare genetic disorder that is typically triggered by certain medications or medical conditions, and is not a likely diagnosis in this case. Oversedation (E) is possible, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with heat stroke than oversedation.

The key information in the question is that the nodule has decreased iodine uptake compared to the rest of the thyroid gland, and the fine-needle aspiration shows a neoplasm. Follicular carcinoma is a type of thyroid cancer that often presents as a solitary nodule with decreased iodine uptake. It is also commonly diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration.

Papillary carcinoma (A) is the most common type of thyroid cancer, but it often presents as a solid or cystic nodule with increased iodine uptake. Medullary carcinoma (B) is a type of thyroid cancer that arises from the parafollicular cells, and it often presents with elevated calcitonin levels. Anaplastic carcinoma (D) is a rare and aggressive type of thyroid cancer that often presents with a large, invasive mass. Hurthle cell carcinoma (E) is a type of follicular carcinoma, but it is less likely to present with decreased iodine uptake.",Success
"A 58-year-old male presents with an acutely elevated blood pressure of 220/140 mmHg. The patient complains of a headache and chest pain, and he has been vomiting for the last several hours. Physical exam demonstrates papilledema and a depressed level of consciousness. To treat this patient's hypertensive emergency, he is started on an IV medication commonly used in this situation. The agent exerts its effect by releasing nitric oxide as a metabolite, which subsequently activates guanylate cyclase and increases production of cGMP in vascular smooth muscle. Which of the following clinical effects would be expected from administration of this medication?",D,"The correct answer is D. Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

The medication being described is sodium nitroprusside, which is commonly used to treat hypertensive emergencies. It works by releasing nitric oxide, which activates guanylate cyclase and increases cGMP production in vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation.

As a result of vasodilation, sodium nitroprusside would be expected to decrease pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which is a measure of left ventricular preload. This is because the vasodilation would reduce the resistance against which the heart has to pump, allowing the heart to pump more efficiently and reducing the pressure in the pulmonary capillaries.

The other options are incorrect:

A. Sodium nitroprusside does not directly affect cardiac contractility.

B. The medication would actually decrease left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, not increase it.

C. The decreased afterload and preload would actually increase stroke volume, not decrease it.

E. Sodium nitroprusside would decrease systemic vascular resistance, not increase it.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman delivers a baby at term. The Apgar counts are 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Thirty minutes after delivery, the mother’s blood pressure drops to 80/60 mm Hg and her pulse is 124/min. On physical examination, her distal extremities are clammy and cold, and the uterus is boggy. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is initiated. After administering 4 units of IV fluids and 4 units of whole blood, her vitals stabilize. The next morning, she says she is unable to lactate when she tries to breastfeed her child. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the failure of lactation in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Pituitary infarction.

The patient's symptoms, including hypotension, tachycardia, and a boggy uterus, suggest postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) due to uterine atony. The administration of IV fluids and whole blood helped to stabilize her vitals. However, the failure of lactation in this patient is likely due to pituitary infarction, also known as Sheehan's syndrome. This is a rare but serious complication of PPH, where the pituitary gland is damaged due to ischemia or infarction, leading to hormone deficiencies, including prolactin, which is essential for lactation.",Success
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of fatigue and yellow discoloration of his skin. One week ago, he had an upper respiratory tract infection. Examination shows jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae. The spleen tip is palpated 2 cm below the left costal margin. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.4 g/dl and his mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is 39% Hb/cell. A Coombs test is negative. A peripheral blood smear is shown. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?",C,"The correct answer is E. Splenic sequestration crisis.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with hemolytic anemia, likely due to hereditary spherocytosis. The peripheral blood smear shows spherocytes, which are characteristic of this condition. Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic disorder that affects the red blood cell membrane, leading to the production of abnormally shaped red blood cells that are prone to hemolysis.

Splenic sequestration crisis is a complication of hereditary spherocytosis, particularly in children. It occurs when the spleen suddenly enlarges and traps large numbers of red blood cells, leading to a rapid drop in hemoglobin levels and potentially life-threatening anemia. This complication is more common in children under the age of 5 and can be triggered by viral infections, such as the upper respiratory tract infection the patient had a week prior to presentation.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:

A. Malaria is a parasitic infection that can cause hemolytic anemia, but it is not a complication of hereditary spherocytosis.

B. Acute myelogenous leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow, but it is not related to the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

C. Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, which is not a complication of hereditary spherocytosis.

D. Renal papillary necrosis is a complication of sickle cell disease, not hereditary spherocytosis.",Success

Physical exam demonstrates a normal S1 and S2, normal breath sounds, and an abdominal exam that is within normal limits. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is D. Pregnancy test.

The patient's blood pressure reading of 147/108 mmHg is elevated, which is a concern. Before attributing it to any underlying medical condition, it's essential to rule out pregnancy, which can cause blood pressure changes. A pregnancy test is a necessary step to determine if the patient is pregnant, which could be contributing to her elevated blood pressure.",Success
"A 25-year-old woman presents generalized abdominal pain and vomiting for the past hour. She has also had watery diarrhea for several days with no blood or pus in the stools. She is taking an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication, which she cannot remember the name of, and drinking oral rehydration solution, which has helped a little.

Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Administer naloxone.

The patient's symptoms, such as constricted pupils, pale and cold extremities, and shallow breathing, suggest opioid toxicity. The fact that she is taking an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication that she cannot remember the name of, and has a history of recent diarrhea, suggests that she may have taken loperamide, an opioid-based anti-diarrheal medication. Loperamide can cause opioid toxicity in large doses. Administering naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is the next best step in management to reverse the opioid toxicity.",Success

The patient is hemodynamically unstable, with worsening vital signs despite fluid administration, and has evidence of hemoperitoneum on bedside sonography. This suggests a life-threatening intra-abdominal injury that requires immediate surgical intervention. Exploratory laparotomy is the best next step to identify and control the source of bleeding.

Option A is incorrect because although fluid administration is important, the patient's hemodynamic instability requires more urgent attention.

Option B is incorrect because CT scanning is not suitable for an unstable patient and would delay definitive treatment.

Option C is incorrect because administering morphine would not address the underlying life-threatening condition and may even worsen the patient's hemodynamics.

The patient is unresponsive and has a low oxygen saturation of 73% despite being on a non-rebreather mask with an FiO2 of 100%. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.32, indicating respiratory acidosis, and a PO2 of 73 mm Hg, indicating hypoxemia. These findings suggest that the patient is not getting enough oxygen and is at risk of respiratory failure.

Reintubation is the best next step in management to secure the airway and provide mechanical ventilation to improve oxygenation and ventilation. This will help to correct the respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Performing a tracheostomy is not indicated at this time, as the patient's airway is not compromised, and reintubation is a more immediate solution.

B. Continuing to use the non-rebreather mask is not sufficient, as the patient is still hypoxemic and unresponsive.

D. Close observation only is not appropriate, as the patient's condition is critical and requires immediate intervention.

"An 11-month-old male infant is brought to his pediatrician by his mother. She is concerned about his leg and his inability to stand. He was born vaginally to a 33-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) from an uncomplicated pregnancy at 39 weeks. He has met all developmental milestones and is up to date on all vaccinations. His mother explains that he can normally stand without help and can walk briefly on his own. However, he hit his right leg against a chair 2 days ago. The area became edematous and bruised overtime and the infant became unable to stand or crawl and cries when he puts weight on it. The mother denies any child abuse from her family or child care. The patient’s vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 137/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 36.7°C (97.0°F). His length and weight are both between the 15th and 25th percentile. On physical examination, blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae are noted. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits for his age. There is joint hypermobility and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities. The patient’s right calf appears slightly deformed, edematous, and warm to the tough. The patient begins to cry loudly when the physician palpates his leg. The patient’s X-ray shows an incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis. What is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Insufficient production of procollagen type 1.

The patient's symptoms, including blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae, joint hypermobility, and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities, are consistent with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones and other connective tissue abnormalities. The incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis is also consistent with OI.

OI is caused by mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, which code for procollagen type 1, a critical component of bone collagen. The insufficient production of procollagen type 1 leads to brittle bones that are prone to fracture.

Child abuse (option A) is unlikely given the mother's denial and the presence of other symptoms consistent with OI. Marfan syndrome (option C) is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue, but it is not typically associated with brittle bones or osteogenesis imperfecta. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (option D) is a group of disorders that affect connective tissue, but it is not typically associated with brittle bones or osteogenesis imperfecta.

"A 21-year-old man comes to the emergency room with swelling and severe pain in his left lower leg that started 2 hours ago. He has no history of serious illness or trauma. His father has a history of pulmonary embolism. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily since he started college 3 years ago. He appears very distressed. He is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 92 kg (203 lb); BMI is 30.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a tender and mildly swollen left lower leg; dorsiflexion of the left foot causes severe pain in the calf. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 184,000/mm3, a prothrombin time of 11 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 26 seconds, and positive fibrin split products. Ultrasonography of the left leg shows incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow. The patient is administered a 5000 IU intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin followed by a constant infusion. Six hours later, the activated partial thromboplastin time is 30 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is C. Factor V Leiden.

The patient's symptoms, including severe pain and swelling in the left lower leg, are consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The ultrasonography findings of incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow also support this diagnosis.

The patient's family history of pulmonary embolism and his personal history of smoking increase his risk for thrombosis. The laboratory results, including a normal platelet count, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time, suggest that the patient does not have a bleeding disorder or a severe coagulopathy.

The presence of fibrin split products indicates that the patient has an ongoing thrombotic process. The patient's response to unfractionated heparin, as evidenced by the prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, suggests that the thrombosis is likely due to a genetic or acquired thrombophilia.

Factor V Leiden is a common genetic mutation that increases the risk of thrombosis. It is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms, given his age, family history, and response to heparin.",Success

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Cardiac pacing.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue and lightheadedness, along with his bradycardia (heart rate of 48/min) and hypotension (blood pressure of 89/50 mm Hg), suggest a cardiac conduction abnormality. The ECG shows a constant PR interval of 0.15 seconds with every third P wave that is nonconducted, which is consistent with a Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. This type of block can cause symptoms due to inadequate cardiac output.

Cardiac pacing is the most appropriate next step in management to address the patient's bradycardia and hypotension. Dopamine, dobutamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are all vasopressors that may be used to support blood pressure, but they do not address the underlying conduction abnormality.",Success
"In a small town with a population of 10,000 people, the prevalence of alcohol use is estimated to be 30%. A study is done with a null hypothesis that there is no association between alcohol use and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The data obtained shows, of the 200 alcoholics who were followed-up, 30 developed GERD; and out of the 400 non-alcoholics, 30 developed GERD. What fraction of GERD can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed in this town?",A,"The correct answer is A. 45/195.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the population attributable risk (PAR), which is the fraction of GERD cases that can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed.

First, we need to calculate the incidence of GERD in alcoholics and non-alcoholics:

Incidence of GERD in alcoholics = 30/200 = 0.15
Incidence of GERD in non-alcoholics = 30/400 = 0.075

Next, we need to calculate the population attributable risk (PAR):

PAR = (Incidence of GERD in alcoholics - Incidence of GERD in non-alcoholics) / Incidence of GERD in alcoholics
= (0.15 - 0.075) / 0.15
= 0.075 / 0.15

On physical examination, a mild conjunctival pallor is evident, and the rectum is erythematous, indurated, and tender. Colonoscopy demonstrates continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon. What is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Ulcerative colitis.

The patient's symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, cramping, grossly bloody stool, and an urge to defecate, are consistent with inflammatory bowel disease. The presence of continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon on colonoscopy also supports this diagnosis. Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that typically affects the rectum and colon, causing inflammation and ulceration of the mucosa.

While the patient's history of bulimia and laxative abuse may have contributed to their symptoms, it is not the primary cause of their current condition. Crohn's disease (option D) is also a type of inflammatory bowel disease, but it typically affects the entire gastrointestinal tract, not just the colon and rectum. Celiac disease (option B) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the small intestine, and irritable bowel syndrome (option C) is a functional disorder that does not typically cause bloody stools or mucosal lesions. Laxative abuse (option E) may have contributed to the patient's symptoms, but it is not the primary diagnosis.",Success

Expressed prostatic secretion Positive Negative
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis.

The patient's symptoms, including pelvic pain, irritative voiding symptoms, and painful ejaculation, are consistent with prostatitis. The presence of white cells in the expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) suggests inflammation, but the negative culture results rule out bacterial infection. The lack of response to antimicrobial therapy and the absence of any other identifiable cause of the symptoms support the diagnosis of chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (A) is unlikely to cause the patient's symptoms, particularly the painful ejaculation and hematospermia. Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis (C) is possible, but the patient's symptoms have been present for 2 years, making acute infection less likely. Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli (D) is also unlikely, given the negative culture results. Interstitial cystitis (E) may cause similar symptoms, but the presence of white cells in the EPS and the patient's other symptoms make prostatitis a more likely diagnosis.",Success

Physical exam is notable for bilateral clear breath sounds, absence of lymphadenopathy on HEENT exam, and a normal oropharynx. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",E,"The correct answer is A. Chest radiograph.

The patient's symptoms of a chronic cough with occasional blood-tinged sputum after a recent respiratory illness suggest the possibility of a pulmonary process, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. A chest radiograph is a non-invasive and relatively inexpensive test that can help evaluate the lungs and identify any abnormalities, such as infiltrates, nodules, or effusions. It is a reasonable next step in management to further evaluate the patient's symptoms and guide further testing or treatment.

CT angiogram (Option B) is not necessary at this point, as it is a more advanced imaging study that is typically reserved for evaluating more complex or severe pulmonary conditions, such as pulmonary embolism.

D-dimer (Option C) is a test that is used to evaluate for pulmonary embolism, but it is not indicated in this patient who does not have symptoms or signs of pulmonary embolism.

Sputum culture (Option D) may be useful in identifying the cause of the patient's cough, but it is not the best next step in management. The patient's symptoms are not severe, and the sputum is clear, which makes it less likely that the patient has a bacterial infection that would require antibiotic treatment.

"A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician because she has not had menstrual bleeding for the past 3 months. Menses had previously occurred at irregular 15–45 day intervals with moderate to heavy flow. Menarche was at the age of 14 years. She started having sexual intercourse with her boyfriend about 3 months ago. Six months ago she had a manic episode, which was treated with risperidone. Her mother has PCOS and her father has diabetes mellitus. She is very conscious of her weight and appearance. She is 171 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (174 lb); BMI is 27.02 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 60/min, and blood pressure is 116/70 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Pelvic examination shows a normal vagina and cervix. Serum hormone studies show:
Prolactin 16 ng/mL
Thyroid-stimulating hormone 3.8 μU/mL
Follicle-stimulating hormone 6 mIU/mL
Luteinizing hormone 5.1 mIU/mL
Progesterone 0.8 ng/mL (follicular N <3; luteal N >3–5)
Testosterone 2.2 nmol/L (N <3.5)
A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms?""",E,"The correct answer is E. Anovulation.

The patient's symptoms of irregular menses, moderate to heavy flow, and recent amenorrhea (no menstrual bleeding for 3 months) suggest anovulation, which is a common cause of menstrual irregularities in adolescents. The hormone studies support this diagnosis, as the FSH and LH levels are within normal ranges, but the progesterone level is low, indicating that ovulation is not occurring.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and hormone studies:

A. Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, but they are not typically associated with amenorrhea.

B. Congenital defects of the Mullerian ducts would likely cause more severe menstrual irregularities and may be associated with other genital tract abnormalities, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.

C. Purging behavior, such as in eating disorders, can cause menstrual irregularities, but the patient's BMI is 27, which suggests that she may be overweight, but not underweight, which is more commonly associated with eating disorders.

D. Polycystic ovaries (PCOS) are a possibility, given the patient's family history and symptoms, but the hormone studies do not support this diagnosis, as the testosterone level is within normal range, and the LH:FSH ratio is not elevated, which is typically seen in PCOS.",Success
"A 21-year-old woman presents with sudden onset of high blood pressure. She is concerned about her health especially after her colleagues noticed that her face gets red at times while at work. She has even started to use blankets to cover her feet, even on the warmest days in the summer, even though her hands feel warm to the touch. She is a student who exercises and eats a well-balanced diet every day. There is no family history of hypertension or other metabolic syndromes. On examination, her blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg, respirations are 19/min, pulse is 64/min, and temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F). An echocardiogram is ordered for investigation. This patient is likely affected by a condition which is associated with which of the following options?",C,"The correct answer is D. Pheochromocytoma.

The patient's symptoms, such as sudden onset of high blood pressure, facial flushing, and cold intolerance (using blankets to cover her feet despite warm temperatures), are consistent with a pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that produces excess catecholamines, leading to hypertension and other symptoms. The echocardiogram is likely ordered to rule out any cardiac complications of hypertension.",Success
"A 52-year-old man presents to the physician with a 6-month history of shortness of breath and nonproductive cough. He was recently diagnosed with stage 3 embryonal carcinoma testicular cancer. Following an orchiectomy, he was placed on chemotherapy. Cardiopulmonary examination shows fine inspiratory crackles bilaterally. There is clubbing present in the fingers bilaterally. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) show FVC is 78% of expected and FEV1/FVC ratio is 92%. A CT scan of the chest is shown. Which of the following drugs is responsible for the patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Bleomycin.

The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and CT scan results are consistent with bleomycin-induced lung toxicity. Bleomycin is a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used to treat testicular cancer, and it is known to cause pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial lung disease. The fine inspiratory crackles, clubbing, and CT scan findings are all consistent with this diagnosis.

The pulmonary function tests (PFTs) showing a reduced FVC and a normal FEV1/FVC ratio also support this diagnosis, as bleomycin-induced lung toxicity typically causes a restrictive pattern of lung disease.

The other options are not typically associated with this type of lung toxicity:

* Carboplatin and cisplatin are platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents that can cause nephrotoxicity and other side effects, but they are not typically associated with pulmonary fibrosis.
* Ifosfamide is an alkylating agent that can cause pulmonary edema and other side effects, but it is not typically associated with interstitial lung disease.
* Methotrexate is an antimetabolite that can cause pulmonary toxicity, but it is more commonly associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) rather than interstitial lung disease.",Success
"A 72-year-old man develops reduced urine output and a serum creatinine concentration of 2.9 mg/dL three days after being hospitalized for acute diverticulitis. On admission, a complete blood count showed a hemoglobin concentration of 15.5 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 14,000/mm3. Urinalysis showed 2+ proteinuria, and serum studies showed a blood glucose of 145 mg/dL and a creatinine concentration of 1.2 mg/dL. A CT scan of the abdomen confirmed the diagnosis. Therapy with intravenous ketoprofen, piperacillin, and tazobactam was begun, and the patient was placed on bowel rest. He has a history of hypertension, chronic constipation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin, metoprolol, and losartan. Today, his temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 135/87 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft on physical examination, and there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current renal findings?",D,"The correct answer is C. Dehydration.

The patient's history of bowel rest, lack of oral intake, and use of ketoprofen (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) suggest that dehydration is the most likely cause of the patient's acute kidney injury. The patient's creatinine level increased from 1.2 mg/dL to 2.9 mg/dL over a short period of time, which is consistent with prerenal azotemia. Additionally, the patient's physical examination findings, such as a soft abdomen and tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant, do not suggest a postrenal cause of kidney injury.",Success
"An immunology expert is delivering a talk on innate immunity. While talking about inflammasomes, he describes the process via an example: products of cellular stress are detected by NLRP3, which includes NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3; the latter interacts with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) via the pyrin domain, which leads to the formation of a protein speck that consists of multimers of ASC dimers. Which of the following enzymes will be activated as the next step in the process?",B,"The correct answer is B. Caspase 1.

Inflammasomes, such as NLRP3, activate caspase 1, which is a cysteine protease that plays a key role in the processing and maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-18. The formation of the protein speck consisting of multimers of ASC dimers leads to the recruitment and activation of caspase 1, which then cleaves and activates these cytokines, leading to their secretion and subsequent inflammatory response.",Success
The ribosome is an essential organelle that plays an important role in the synthesis of new proteins. The location of the ribosome within the cell can vary and provides a clue to the function of the particular cell. What ribosome location is essential for protein-secreting cells?,A,"The correct answer is A. Rough endoplasmic reticulum.

In protein-secreting cells, such as pancreatic cells that produce digestive enzymes, ribosomes are typically found attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The RER is a type of endoplasmic reticulum that is studded with ribosomes, which synthesize proteins that are then transported into the RER for further processing and secretion. This location allows for the efficient synthesis and secretion of proteins, which is essential for the function of protein-secreting cells.",Success
"A patient presents to the emergency department with severe pain in her head. She states that the pain started 1 hour ago after rugby practice. Typically, she takes a special medication for bad headaches, but this time she took 2 doses and noticed no improvement in her symptoms.

Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 129/65 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient is given dihydroergotamine, IV fluids, and is started on 100% oxygen. Two hours later, the patient demonstrates slurring of her speech. On physical exam there is drooping of the left side of her mouth, and her left upper extremity demonstrates 2/5 strength. A head CT is ordered. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current presentation?",C,"The correct answer is E. Subarachnoid hemorrhage.

The patient's symptoms, including severe headache, lack of response to usual medications, and subsequent development of neurological deficits (slurred speech, drooping of the left side of the mouth, and weakness in the left upper extremity), are consistent with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient's history of taking dihydroergotamine, a vasoconstrictor, may have contributed to the development of vasospasm, which can cause ischemia and infarction. The head CT is likely to show blood in the subarachnoid space, confirming the diagnosis.",Success
A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine gynecological examination and to refill her birth control pills. Her last pap smear at age 22 showed no intraepithelial lesions nor malignancy of the cervical cells. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 4 days. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with one male partner. Her father died of colon cancer at the age of 75 years and her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40 years. She mentions that she is planning a backpacking trip through Europe in 2 months. Her routine immunizations are all up-to-date. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F) and her blood pressure is 94/58 mm Hg. Pelvic and speculum examination show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the best recommendation for the patient at this time?,A,"The correct answer is A. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis screening.

The patient is sexually active with one male partner, and as part of routine gynecological care, it is recommended to screen for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. This is especially important since she is planning a trip abroad and may be at increased risk of acquiring an STI.

There is no indication for a beta-hCG urine test (Option B) as the patient is not pregnant and is using birth control pills.

A repeat Pap smear (Option C) is not necessary at this time since her previous Pap smear was normal and she is not due for another screening.

Mammography (Option D) is not recommended for this patient as she is only 24 years old and has no symptoms or risk factors for breast cancer.

Option E, no further testing is necessary, is incorrect as the patient should be screened for STIs as part of routine gynecological care.",Success
"A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient has a past medical history of asthma and cocaine use.

Which of the following is most likely to be found in this patient's history?",A,"The correct answer is D. Hepatitis C infection.

The patient's history of intravenous drug use (cocaine) increases the risk of blood-borne infections, including hepatitis C. The scenario describes a trauma patient who requires a blood transfusion, which further supports the likelihood of hepatitis C infection in this patient's history.",Success
An academic obstetrician is conducting a retrospective cohort study that evaluates the risk of placenta accreta at all statewide medical centers. Per chart review he finds that a prior cesarian birth is associated with a statistically significant increased risk of placenta accreta. The relative risk associated with this finding is 1.23. The associated p-value is 0.03. Which of the following statements is the best interpretation of the reported association in the context of the study?,A,"The correct answer is B. The chance of bias in favor of the alternative hypothesis is 3%.

The p-value of 0.03 indicates that there is a 3% chance of observing the reported association (or a more extreme association) between prior cesarian birth and placenta accreta if there is no real association between the two variables (i.e., the null hypothesis is true). This means that the observed association is unlikely to be due to chance, and it is likely that there is a real association between prior cesarian birth and placenta accreta.

The relative risk of 1.23 indicates that women with prior cesarian birth have a 23% increased risk of placenta accreta compared to women without prior cesarian birth, but this is not directly related to the p-value.

The other options are incorrect:

A. The p-value is 0.03, which means that the null hypothesis is rejected, and the 99% confidence interval would not include the null hypothesis.

C. The p-value represents the probability of observing the reported association (or a more extreme association) assuming the null hypothesis is true, not the alternative hypothesis.

D. The p-value does not represent the probability of seeing the reported risk by chance alone. Instead, it represents the probability of observing the reported association (or a more extreme association) if there is no real association.

E. The p-value does not represent the likelihood that the alternative hypothesis is false. Instead, it represents the probability of observing the reported association (or a more extreme association) if the null hypothesis is true.",Success
"A 23-year-old man presents to his primary care physician after bleeding from his gums while brushing his teeth for the past week. Although he has had gum bleeding in the past, it has never been this severe. He has no family history available as he was adopted. He does not have any significant past medical history. His physical exam is within normal limits. Screening lab work is ordered with the following values:
Platelet count 330,000/mm3
Bleeding time 6 mins
Prothrombin time 12 sec
Activated partial thromboplastin time 42 sec
Factor VIII activity decreased
Ristocetin cofactor assay decreased
He is subsequently referred to a hematologist for further work-up and treatment. Which of the following aspects of coagulation would most likely be affected?",B,"The correct answer is B. Gp Ib.

The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (VWD), a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF). VWF is a protein that plays a critical role in platelet adhesion and aggregation, and it also carries and stabilizes factor VIII.

The decreased factor VIII activity and ristocetin cofactor assay results are consistent with VWD. Ristocetin is a antibiotic that induces platelet aggregation in the presence of VWF, and a decreased response to ristocetin is a hallmark of VWD.

Gp Ib is a platelet receptor that interacts with VWF, and it is involved in platelet adhesion and aggregation. In VWD, the deficiency or dysfunction of VWF leads to impaired platelet adhesion and aggregation, which is reflected in the prolonged bleeding time.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and lab results:

A. Factor IX is involved in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and is not directly related to VWD.

C. Factor XI is also involved in the intrinsic pathway, but it is not typically affected in VWD.

D. Vitamin K is involved in the synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, and is not directly related to VWD.

The physical examination shows no abnormal findings. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA scan) shows a T-score of -3.2 standard deviations (SDs) in the hip. The patient is educated regarding her risk of falls. Exercise regimen and smoking cessation assistance are provided. Appropriate diet is indicated, as well as supplements with calcium and vitamin D. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy?",A,"The correct answer is A. Alendronate.

The patient has a T-score of -3.2 standard deviations (SDs) in the hip, which indicates severe osteoporosis. Given her history of Colles' fracture, sedentary lifestyle, and smoking, she is at high risk for future fractures. The most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy would be to initiate bisphosphonate therapy, specifically alendronate, to reduce her risk of fractures. Alendronate is a commonly used medication for the treatment of osteoporosis, and it has been shown to reduce the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures.",Success
"A 33-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 26 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department because of frequent contractions. The contractions last 40 seconds, occur every 2 minutes, and are increasing in intensity. She has a history of recurrent painful ulcers on her vulva, but she currently does not have them. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a non-reassuring fetal heart rate. Her current medications include acyclovir, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate is 88/min, and blood pressure is 126/76 mm Hg. Contractions are felt on the abdomen. The cervix is dilated to 5 cm, 70% effaced, and the station of the head is -2. A fetal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. Allow vaginal delivery.

The patient is presenting with frequent contractions and is already 5 cm dilated, which indicates that labor is progressing. Given her history of a previous cesarean section, a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) is a viable option. The patient's current condition and fetal ultrasound results do not indicate any complications that would require a cesarean delivery. Therefore, allowing vaginal delivery is the most appropriate next step in management.

Misoprostol therapy (Option B) is not indicated in this scenario, as it is typically used to induce labor, which is already progressing. Nifedipine therapy (Option C) is used to tocolyze (stop) contractions, which is not necessary in this case. Performing a cesarean delivery (Option D) is not necessary at this point, as the patient is a good candidate for VBAC. Dilation and evacuation (Option E) is not relevant in this scenario, as it is a procedure typically used for pregnancy termination, not for managing labor.",Success

Physical examination reveals 2+ bilateral pitting edema. Chest auscultation reveals bibasilar crackles. Which of the following is associated with this patient’s condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest heart failure, likely due to long-standing hypertension and alcohol abuse. The presence of bibasilar crackles, bilateral pitting edema, and exertional dyspnea are all consistent with this diagnosis.

In heart failure, the body's response to decreased cardiac output is to increase sodium retention, which leads to increased extracellular fluid volume and edema. This is achieved through the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which stimulates the kidneys to reabsorb more sodium and water. Therefore, option E, increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption, is associated with this patient's condition.

The other options are not directly related to this patient's condition:

A. Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may occur in heart failure, but it is not a primary mechanism driving the patient's symptoms.

B. Decreased vascular smooth muscle tone is not typically associated with heart failure.

C. Decreased extracellular fluid (ECF) volume is the opposite of what is seen in heart failure, where ECF volume is increased due to sodium retention.

Capillary refill is 2 seconds. Sensorimotor evaluation of the hand is without deficits. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment choice for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Amoxicillin-clavulanate.

The patient has been bitten by a stray dog and has localized cellulitis, which suggests a bacterial infection. The most common bacteria that cause dog bite infections are Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus species. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers these bacteria and is the recommended treatment for dog bite wounds. It is also effective against anaerobic bacteria that may be present in the wound.

Amoxicillin alone (Option A) may not be effective against P. multocida, which is a common cause of dog bite infections. Clindamycin (Option C) is not a good choice because it does not cover P. multocida and may not be effective against Streptococcus species.

"A 3-year-old refugee with increasing pitting edema and abdominal swelling over the past 2 months is brought to the physician. Her family has been displaced several times over the last few years. Nutrition and housing were frequently inadequate. At the physician’s clinic, the boy appears irritated and drowsy. He is difficult to arouse. Physical examination shows pitting edema over the ankles and feet and around his eyes. Abdominal examination is positive for ascites and hepatomegaly. Oral examination shows several missing teeth. Which of the following best explains these findings?",A,"The correct answer is A. Kwashiorkor.

The symptoms described, such as pitting edema, abdominal swelling, ascites, and hepatomegaly, are consistent with kwashiorkor, a form of protein-energy malnutrition. The presence of edema, particularly in the ankles and feet, is a hallmark of kwashiorkor. The patient's irritability and difficulty arousing are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Marasmus (option B) is another form of protein-energy malnutrition, but it typically presents with wasting and emaciation, rather than edema.

Beriberi (option C) is a condition caused by thiamine deficiency, and it can cause edema, but it is typically seen in the context of a diet heavily reliant on polished rice.

Rickets (option D) is a condition caused by vitamin D deficiency, and it typically presents with skeletal deformities, rather than edema and abdominal swelling.

Scurvy (option E) is a condition caused by vitamin C deficiency, and it typically presents with bleeding gums, joint pain, and poor wound healing, rather than edema and abdominal swelling.

On physical examination, her heart has a regular rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Which of the following is most consistent with her behavior?",C,"The correct answer is C. Avoidant personality disorder.

The patient's behavior is consistent with avoidant personality disorder, which is characterized by feelings of inadequacy, social inhibition, and avoidance of social interactions due to fear of criticism, rejection, or embarrassment. The patient's timid and anxious demeanor, avoidance of eye contact, and limited social interactions are all consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, her desire to be in a relationship despite her social anxiety and avoidance suggests a strong desire for human connection, which is also characteristic of avoidant personality disorder.

Agoraphobia (option E) is a possibility, given the patient's avoidance of leaving the house, but it is not the best fit, as agoraphobia is typically characterized by a fear of being in situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing, rather than a general fear of social interactions.

Body dysmorphic disorder (option A) is not supported by the information provided, as there is no mention of preoccupation with a perceived physical defect.

Schizoid personality disorder (option B) is also not a good fit, as it is characterized by a lack of desire for social relationships, whereas this patient expresses a strong desire to be in a relationship.

On exam, the boy is lethargic but responsive. He appears to be grasping at his ears and swaying from side-to-side when attempting to ambulate. He vomited once in the emergency room. Which of the following arterial blood gas readings is most likely to be found in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is B. pH 7.35, PCO2 29 mmHg, and HCO3- 15 mEq/L.

The patient's symptoms, such as lethargy, vomiting, and ataxia (swaying from side-to-side when attempting to ambulate), suggest acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen overdose can cause a metabolic acidosis, which is characterized by a low pH and a low bicarbonate level.

Option B is the only choice that reflects a metabolic acidosis, with a pH of 7.35 (slightly acidic) and a bicarbonate level of 15 mEq/L (low). The PCO2 of 29 mmHg is consistent with a respiratory compensation for the metabolic acidosis.

The other options do not reflect a metabolic acidosis and are therefore less likely to be correct.",Success
"A 38-year-old man presents with progressive tiredness and shortness of breath on exertion. Past medical history is significant for peptic ulcer disease diagnosed 2 years ago for which he is not compliant with his medications. He reports a 10-pack-year smoking history and occasionally alcohol use. His vital signs include: temperature 37.1°C (98.7°F), blood pressure 142/91 mm Hg, pulse 98/min. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL

Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) 620 μg/dL
Transferrin saturation 9%
Which of the following findings would most likely be found on a bone marrow biopsy in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. ↓ hemosiderin stores.

The patient's laboratory results suggest iron deficiency anemia, which is characterized by a low hemoglobin, hematocrit, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). The low transferrin saturation and high total iron binding capacity (TIBC) also support this diagnosis. Iron deficiency anemia is often associated with decreased hemosiderin stores in the bone marrow.

The other options are not directly related to iron deficiency anemia:

A. Hypocellularity with fatty infiltration is more characteristic of aplastic anemia.

B. ↑ megakaryocytes may be seen in thrombocytosis or myeloproliferative disorders.

"A 27-year-old G3P1010 makes an appointment with her gynecologist for evaluation of profuse bleeding, which began two days ago. She is 13 weeks pregnant based on the date of her last menstrual period. She is dizzy and weak, and is unable to move around the house and perform her daily tasks. Initially, she had only light spotting, but later on in the day the bleeding increased. Thus far, she has used six sanitary pads. The blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, the temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), the pulse is 125/min, and the respiratory rate is 14/min. A saline infusion is started, and blood and urine specimens are sent for analysis. On pelvic examination, the vagina contains blood and the cervical os is open. She also complains of cervical motion and adnexal tenderness on examination. An ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac low in the uterine cavity. No fetal movement or cardiac activity are observed. She is advised to rest for a couple of hours, after which the scan is repeated. Slight downward migration of the gestational sac is observed with no change in the fetal status. Which of the following is the next step in management?",E,"The correct answer is E. Dilation and curettage.

The patient is experiencing profuse bleeding and is hemodynamically unstable, with a low blood pressure and tachycardia. The ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac low in the uterine cavity, but no fetal movement or cardiac activity, suggesting a non-viable pregnancy. The downward migration of the gestational sac on repeat scan suggests that the pregnancy is likely to be an incomplete abortion.

Given the patient's unstable condition and the likelihood of an incomplete abortion, the next step in management is to perform a dilation and curettage (D&C) to evacuate the uterus and control the bleeding. This is a surgical procedure that involves dilating the cervix and using a curette to remove the pregnancy tissue from the uterus.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Antibiotics are not indicated in this scenario, as there is no evidence of infection.

B. Bed rest and analgesics may be used to manage the patient's symptoms, but they do not address the underlying issue of the incomplete abortion.

C. Magnesium sulfate is not indicated in this scenario, as it is typically used to prevent seizures in patients with preeclampsia.

D. Methotrexate is a medication used to terminate an ectopic pregnancy, but it is not indicated in this scenario, as the pregnancy is intrauterine and non-viable.",Success
"An otherwise healthy 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of pain and swelling of her right knee joint and left wrist. She went camping with her new boyfriend 3 weeks ago but does not recall any tick bites. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F). Examination of the right knee shows swelling, warmth, and tenderness on passive movement. There is a tender pustule on the sole of the left foot. Arthrocentesis of the right knee joint yields 8 mL of cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 45,000/mm3 (90% segmented neutrophils with intracellular organisms). Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for this patient's condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Sexually transmitted infection.

The patient's symptoms, including pain and swelling of the knee joint and wrist, along with the presence of a tender pustule on the sole of the foot, are consistent with a diagnosis of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI). The presence of intracellular organisms in the joint fluid further supports this diagnosis. DGI is a complication of gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted infection.",Success
"A 54-year-old man comes to the clinic for management of his gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He is currently on cimetidine for his condition and reports that his GERD initially improved. However, following his recent move to Michigan, he is experiencing more frequent episodes of chest pain (4-5 times a week). The pain is described as burning in quality and is concentrated around his epigastric region following food ingestion. It does not radiate anywhere and is alleviated when he takes antacids. A physical examination demonstrates a healthy male with unremarkable findings. He is subsequently prescribed a new medication for control of his symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism of action of this new medication?",B,"The correct answer is D. Reversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells.

The patient's symptoms suggest that the cimetidine (an H2 receptor antagonist) is no longer effective in controlling his GERD, and a new medication is needed. The most likely medication prescribed would be a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), which acts by reversibly inhibiting the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme at parietal cells, thereby reducing acid production in the stomach.",Success
A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for evaluation of progressively worsening swelling around the eyes. He has no history of major medical illness. He had a sore throat and cough 2 weeks ago that resolved spontaneously. Physical examination shows moderate periorbital edema and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities bilaterally. A kidney biopsy specimen shows effacement of the podocytes on electron microscopy. Which of the following is most likely to be found on urinalysis?,C,"The correct answer is C. Fatty casts and albumin.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by proteinuria, edema, and lipiduria. The electron microscopy finding of effacement of the podocytes is also consistent with nephrotic syndrome.

On urinalysis, the presence of fatty casts and albumin is typical of nephrotic syndrome. Fatty casts are formed when lipids from the bloodstream enter the urine and combine with Tamm-Horsfall protein, forming casts. Albumin is a protein that is normally not present in significant amounts in the urine, but in nephrotic syndrome, there is increased permeability of the glomerular capillaries, leading to proteinuria.

The other options are not consistent with the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome:

A. Hyaline casts and immunoglobulins are not typically seen in nephrotic syndrome.

B. Red blood cell casts and acanthocytes are more consistent with glomerulonephritis or vasculitis.

D. White blood cell casts and eosinophils are more consistent with pyelonephritis or allergic interstitial nephritis.

E. Granular casts and tubular epithelial cells are more consistent with acute tubular necrosis or chronic kidney disease.",Success
"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?",A,"The correct answer is C. Lead-time bias.

Lead-time bias occurs when a screening test or diagnostic method appears to improve outcomes because it detects a condition earlier, but the earlier detection does not actually change the natural course of the disease. In this case, if the conclusion that initial ultrasonography is associated with better outcomes is due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point-of-care ultrasound, it would be an example of lead-time bias. The earlier detection of nephrolithiasis may not actually change the outcome, but it would make it seem like the ultrasonography group has better outcomes because the condition was detected earlier.",Success
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of intermittent chest pain and palpitations. She also complains of dyspnea on exertion and has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss in the past 2 months despite normal appetite. She has no history of serious medical illness. Cardiac examination shows an irregularly irregular rhythm and a grade 3/6, low pitched, rumbling, mid-diastolic murmur heard best over the apex. Diffuse wheezing and bilateral rales are present in the lung bases. A transthoracic echocardiogram shows a left-ventricular ejection fraction of 40% and a mass in the left atrium. A biopsy of the mass is likely to show which of the following?",E,"The correct answer is B. Clusters of bland cells without mitotic activity.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of atrial myxoma, a benign tumor that typically arises in the left atrium. The echocardiogram findings of a mass in the left atrium and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction support this diagnosis. A biopsy of the mass would likely show clusters of bland cells without mitotic activity, which is characteristic of myxoma.",Success
"A 58-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent painful retrosternal dullness for 4 weeks. The pain is recurrent and occurs when she exerts herself or when she is outside during cold weather. She also experiences shortness of breath and palpitations during these episodes. The symptoms resolve spontaneously when she stops or sits down for a while. Over the past few days, the episodes have increased in frequency. She has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. Her left leg was amputated below the knee after a motorcycle accident 25 years ago. She is currently waiting for a new prosthesis and walks with crutches. Current medications include captopril, glyburide, and ibuprofen. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her pulse is 88/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 144/90 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm without any signs of ischemia. Serum cardiac markers are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with angina pectoris, which is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen-rich blood. The pain is triggered by exertion and relieved by rest, which is a classic pattern of angina. The patient's risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes, also support this diagnosis.

A myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress is a non-invasive test that can help diagnose coronary artery disease, which is the underlying cause of angina. The test involves injecting a small amount of radioactive material into the bloodstream, which allows areas of the heart with reduced blood flow to be identified. Pharmacological stress, such as with dipyridamole or adenosine, is used to mimic the effects of exercise on the heart.

Option B, upper endoscopy, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms and would not be a useful diagnostic test in this case. Option C, coronary angiography, is an invasive test that may be necessary if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, but it is not the next step in diagnosis. Option D, echocardiography at rest, may be useful in evaluating the patient's cardiac function, but it would not provide information about coronary artery disease or myocardial perfusion. Option E, repeat ECG under treadmill stress, may be useful in diagnosing coronary artery disease, but it is not as sensitive or specific as a myocardial perfusion scan.",Success

The uterus is enlarged to the umbilicus and the fetal heart rate is normal. Which of the following statements is the most accurate with respect to the presented case?",C,"The correct answer is C. Urine culture should be performed in this patient again.

The patient was previously diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria and treated with amoxicillin. However, it is recommended to perform a test of cure, typically a urine culture, 1-2 weeks after completing treatment to ensure that the infection has been fully cleared. This is because asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy can increase the risk of pyelonephritis and other complications if left untreated. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that a urine culture should be performed again to confirm that the infection has been eradicated.",Success

"A 30-year-old female presents to her primary care provider complaining of 4 days of fever, malaise, dyspnea, and productive cough and has recently developed pleuritic chest pain. Her past medical history is notable for asthma and takes albuterol as needed. She does not smoke but drinks alcohol socially. Her family history is notable for cystic fibrosis in her paternal uncle and interstitial lung disease in her paternal grandfather. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 21/min. Rales are noted in the right lower lung, and a chest radiograph demonstrates focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe. After initiating the appropriate treatment, she agrees to take part in a study assessing the immune response to lung infections. A protein is identified in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition. An amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated and a fluorescent marker is added to the sequence. This labeled sequence is subsequently added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient’s own neutrophils and macrophages and subsequently labeled with another fluorescent marker. The sequence binds strongly to this protein as evidenced by increased fluorescence in the gel. What process does this sequence typically undergo in immunocompetent individuals?",E,"The correct answer is D. VDJ recombination.

The protein identified in the patient's serum is likely an antibody, and the amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus is likely the antigen-binding region. The fact that it binds strongly to a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient's own neutrophils and macrophages suggests that it is an antibody that recognizes a specific antigen.

VDJ recombination is the process by which the immune system generates diversity in the antigen-binding regions of antibodies. It involves the random rearrangement of gene segments (V, D, and J) to create a unique antigen-binding region. This process occurs in immunocompetent individuals and is essential for generating a diverse repertoire of antibodies that can recognize and respond to a wide range of antigens.

The other options are not directly related to the process described:

A. Affinity maturation is the process by which antibodies increase their binding affinity for an antigen over time, but it is not directly related to the generation of antibody diversity.

His body was discovered 7 hours later by a group of campers who promptly called the police. On arrival, the police found his body to be cold and stiff. Which of the following processes is responsible for the rigidity observed?",D,"The correct answer is D. Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling.

Rigidity, also known as rigor mortis, is a post-mortem phenomenon characterized by stiffness of the muscles. It occurs due to the depletion of ATP in the muscles, which leads to the inhibition of cross-bridge cycling between actin and myosin filaments. As a result, the muscles become locked in a rigid state.

"A 65-year-old female patient comes to the physician’s office for her annual check-up. The patient’s only complaint is that she feels her vision has been getting more blurry over the past year. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes diagnosed 20 years ago and osteoarthritis. Her medications include metformin, glimepiride, and ibuprofen as needed for pain. Fundoscopic examination of this patient reveals narrowing of retinal arteries and microaneurysms. This patient’s symptoms are likely caused by tissue specific differences in expression of which of the following enzymes?",B,"The correct answer is A. Aldose reductase.

The patient's symptoms, including blurry vision, and the fundoscopic examination findings, such as narrowing of retinal arteries and microaneurysms, are consistent with diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the blood vessels in the retina.

Aldose reductase is an enzyme that plays a key role in the development of diabetic retinopathy. It is involved in the polyol pathway, which is a metabolic pathway that is activated in response to high glucose levels. In the polyol pathway, glucose is converted to sorbitol, which can accumulate in the cells and cause damage. Aldose reductase is the first enzyme in this pathway, and its activity is increased in diabetic retinopathy.

The other options are not directly related to diabetic retinopathy:

* Sorbitol dehydrogenase (option B) is an enzyme that converts sorbitol to fructose, but it is not directly involved in the development of diabetic retinopathy.
* Galactocerebrosidase (option C) is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of galactolipids, and is not related to diabetic retinopathy.
* Arylsulfatase A (option D) is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of sulfated glycolipids, and is not related to diabetic retinopathy.
* Sphingomyelinase (option E) is an enzyme involved in the breakdown of sphingomyelin, and is not related to diabetic retinopathy.",Success
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for the evaluation of recurrent skin lesions. The episodes of lesions started at the age of 2 months and multiple treatment options have been attempted without success. He has also had several episodes of respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers since birth. The boy attends daycare. His older brother has asthma. The patient's immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 5th percentile for length and 10th percentile for weight. He appears ill. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. Examination shows several raised, erythematous lesions of different sizes over the face, neck, groins, and extremities; some secrete pus. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes are enlarged bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Chronic granulomatous disease.

The patient's symptoms, including recurrent skin lesions, respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers, are consistent with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). CGD is a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system, making it difficult for the body to fight off bacterial and fungal infections. The skin lesions, which are described as raised, erythematous, and pus-filled, are also consistent with CGD.

The other options are not as likely:

B. Ataxia-telangiectasia is a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and causes coordination problems, but it is not typically associated with recurrent skin lesions and infections.

C. Atopic dermatitis is a common skin condition that causes itching and inflammation, but it is not typically associated with recurrent infections and enlarged lymph nodes.

D. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the immune system, but it is typically associated with eczema, bleeding problems, and recurrent infections, rather than the specific skin lesions described in this case.

"A 53-year-old man presents to clinic with a six month history of shoulder pain that is especially bothersome at night. Over the weekend he ""strained his shoulder"" during a pick-up basketball game and reports an acute exacerbation of his pain symptoms. On exam, he complains of pain to palpation just below the acromion. You suspect he has torn his supraspinatus. If correct, which of these functional maneuvers would you expect to be deficient on physical exam?",C,"The correct answer is C. Initiation of abduction.

The supraspinatus muscle is responsible for initiating abduction of the shoulder, specifically the first 15-20 degrees of abduction. If the supraspinatus is torn, the patient would likely have difficulty initiating abduction, making option C the correct answer.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Initiation of adduction is not a function of the supraspinatus muscle.

B. External rotation is a function of the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles, not the supraspinatus.

D. Completion of abduction is a function of the deltoid muscle, not the supraspinatus.

E. Internal rotation is a function of the subscapularis, pectoralis major, and latissimus dorsi muscles, not the supraspinatus.",Success

Her mother died of metastatic breast cancer 15 years ago, at the age of 65 years. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Current medications include atorvastatin, labetalol, and aspirin. Over the past 2 months, she has been taking over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed for the joint pain. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 84 kg (185 lb); BMI is 31.8 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 114/68 mm Hg. Examination of the left knee shows tenderness on palpation of the anteromedial joint line; there is crepitus and pain with full flexion and extension. Serum uric acid concentration is 8.0 mg/dL and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 15 mm/h. Which of the following is the most likely finding on imaging of the left knee?",A,"The correct answer is A. Osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA) of the left knee. The presence of tenderness on palpation of the anteromedial joint line, crepitus, and pain with full flexion and extension are all characteristic of OA. The patient's age, BMI, and lack of trauma history also support this diagnosis.

Osteophytes (bone spurs) and joint-space narrowing are common radiographic findings in OA, which is why option A is the most likely finding on imaging of the left knee.

Option B is more consistent with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (CPPD), which is a different type of arthritis.

Option C is more consistent with a bone tumor or metastatic disease, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Option D is more consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

He has a history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide and nephrolithiasis. Examination shows erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the right metatarsophalangeal joint; range of movement is limited by pain. His serum uric acid is 12 mg/dL. Arthrocentesis yields cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 18,500/mm3 (80% segmented neutrophils). Polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid is shown. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of gout, a type of inflammatory arthritis caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints. The polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid shows negatively birefringent crystals, which is characteristic of uric acid crystals.

The most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for gout is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, such as allopurinol. Xanthine oxidase is an enzyme that converts hypoxanthine to xanthine and then to uric acid. By inhibiting xanthine oxidase, allopurinol reduces the production of uric acid and helps to prevent the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints.

The other options are not correct:

A. Increased conversion of uric acid to allantoin is the mechanism of action of rasburicase, a uricolytic agent used to treat tumor lysis syndrome, not gout.

B. Inhibition of phospholipase A is the mechanism of action of certain anti-inflammatory drugs, but it is not relevant to the treatment of gout.

D. Increased renal excretion of urate is the mechanism of action of uricosuric agents, such as probenecid, which are used to treat gout, but they are not the most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient.

E. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase is the mechanism of action of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are used to treat the acute symptoms of gout, but they are not a long-term treatment for the condition.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe dyspnea, wheezing, and palpitations. His symptoms began approx. 20 minutes after being stung by a bee on the left arm.

His vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F); blood pressure 85/55 mm Hg; pulse 110/min; respiratory rate 31/min; and oxygen saturation 90% on room air. On physical examination, an area of severe edema and erythema is noted on the extensor surface of the left forearm, and there is severe angioedema of the face and neck. The patient is intubated, and aggressive fluid resuscitation and intramuscular epinephrine are administered. A repeat blood pressure is 90/55 mm Hg, despite these efforts. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is E. Administer norepinephrine.

The patient is experiencing anaphylaxis, a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction, likely due to the bee sting. Despite being intubated and receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation and intramuscular epinephrine, the patient's blood pressure remains low. This suggests that the patient is experiencing refractory hypotension, which is a common complication of anaphylaxis.

Norepinephrine is a vasopressor that can help increase blood pressure in patients with refractory hypotension. It is often used in anaphylaxis when other measures, such as fluid resuscitation and epinephrine, are not effective.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Dopamine is not typically used in anaphylaxis, and its effects on blood pressure can be variable.

B. Glucagon is used to treat beta-blocker overdose, but it is not indicated in anaphylaxis.

C. Dexamethasone is an anti-inflammatory medication that may be used in anaphylaxis, but it is not the next best step in managing this patient's refractory hypotension.

Since the initiation of therapy, the growth of the cancerous tissue has slowed. This medication is known to be excreted by the kidneys at the current dose that he is taking. The patient has no significant complaints, except for excessive sweating at times. On physical examination, a small area of tissue around his nipples is enlarged bilaterally. No other abnormal findings are present. Which of the following drugs most likely belongs to be the same class as drug X?",C,"The correct answer is C. Flutamide.

The description of the medication (drug X) suggests that it is an androgen receptor antagonist, which blocks the action of testosterone. Flutamide is a non-steroidal antiandrogen that works by binding to androgen receptors, thereby blocking the action of testosterone. It is used to treat prostate cancer, which is consistent with the patient's diagnosis.

Leuprolide (A) is a GnRH agonist that reduces testosterone levels by suppressing the production of luteinizing hormone.

Finasteride (B) is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that reduces the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, but it does not directly block androgen receptors.

Physical examination shows decreased sensation to light touch extending from the soles of the feet to the mid-shin bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s current symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is D. Impaired breakdown of glucose to ATP.

The patient's symptoms, such as numbness and burning in the feet and an unsteady gait, are consistent with peripheral neuropathy. The fact that the patient is being treated with an antimycobacterial drug (likely isoniazid) for latent tuberculosis suggests that the neuropathy is likely caused by a side effect of the medication. Isoniazid is known to cause peripheral neuropathy in some individuals, particularly those who are deficient in vitamin B6 (pyridoxine).

"A 64-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with a complaint of bilateral knee pain that has been present for the past several years but has worsened recently. He reports pain with climbing stairs and with extended walks of greater than 100 yards. The pain worsens with activity throughout the day and is alleviated by periods of rest. He states that he has minimal morning stiffness, lasting approximately 5-10 minutes after waking up most days. Physical examination reveals tenderness to palpation of the bony structures on the medial aspect of the bilateral knees as well as crepitus and a decreased range of motion, limited at the extremes of flexion and extension. Both knee joints are cool to touch and exhibit bony enlargement upon palpation of the medial joint line. Which of the following studies would be indicated for further work-up of this patient's presenting condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. No further work-up needed.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knees. The presence of bilateral knee pain, worsened by activity and relieved by rest, is typical of OA. The physical examination findings of tenderness to palpation of the bony structures, crepitus, and decreased range of motion are also consistent with OA. The absence of morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes and the lack of warmth or redness in the joints make it unlikely that the patient has an inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Given the classic presentation of OA, no further work-up is needed to establish the diagnosis. Imaging studies such as X-rays or MRI may be useful in confirming the diagnosis and assessing the severity of the disease, but they are not necessary in this case. Laboratory tests such as a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and rheumatoid factor (RF) are not indicated, as they would not change the management of the patient's condition.",Success

* History of diarrhea and vomiting, which is a common precursor to HUS
* Presence of schistocytes on the peripheral blood smear, which indicates microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
* Thrombocytopenia (low platelet count)
* Elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, which indicates hemolysis
* Renal dysfunction, as evidenced by elevated serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels

A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue and joint pain for the past 4 months. Examination shows erythema with scaling on both cheeks that spares the nasolabial folds and two 1-cm ulcers in the oral cavity. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?,A,"The correct answer is B. Increased platelet count.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The rash on the cheeks that spares the nasolabial folds is a classic finding in SLE, known as a ""butterfly rash."" The oral ulcers are also a common feature of SLE.

In SLE, the immune system is overactive, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. As a result, the platelet count is often elevated as a response to inflammation. This is why option B, Increased platelet count, is the correct answer.

The other options are not correct because:

* A. Decreased lymphocyte count is not typically seen in SLE.
* C. Increased complement component 3 is not a characteristic finding in SLE. In fact, complement levels are often decreased in SLE due to consumption of complement proteins in the inflammatory process.
* D. Increased prothrombin time is not a typical finding in SLE, and would suggest a bleeding disorder rather than an autoimmune disease.
* E. Decreased gamma globulin is not a characteristic finding in SLE. In fact, many patients with SLE have elevated levels of gamma globulin due to the production of autoantibodies.",Success
"A 66-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction presents to your primary care office with complaints of dyspnea on exertion and swollen feet and ankles. On exam, you note an elevated JVP and 2+ pitting edema of bilateral lower extremities. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema?",A,"The correct answer is A. Increase in capillary pressure.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as dyspnea on exertion, elevated JVP, and bilateral lower extremity edema, are consistent with heart failure. In heart failure, the heart is unable to pump effectively, leading to increased pressure in the veins and capillaries. This increased pressure pushes fluid out of the capillaries and into the interstitial space, causing edema.

Transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, a surgical procedure to remove the pituitary tumor, is the most appropriate treatment for this patient. This procedure is often effective in normalizing cortisol production and alleviating symptoms.",Success
A scientist observes a myocyte beating in cell culture. Which step is the most direct necessary component of relaxation for this cell?,E,"The correct answer is E. Efflux of calcium ions.

Relaxation of a myocyte (muscle cell) requires the removal of calcium ions from the cytosol, which allows the muscle to relax. Calcium ions are necessary for muscle contraction, and when they are present in high concentrations, the muscle contracts. When calcium ions are removed, the muscle relaxes.

In this scenario, the scientist observes a myocyte beating in cell culture, which means the cell is contracting and relaxing repeatedly. For relaxation to occur, calcium ions must be removed from the cytosol, making efflux of calcium ions the most direct necessary component of relaxation.

The other options are not directly related to relaxation:

A. Influx of sodium ions is not directly related to muscle relaxation.

B. Efflux of potassium ions can contribute to repolarization of the muscle cell, but it is not the most direct necessary component of relaxation.

C. Influx of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum would actually increase calcium concentrations and promote contraction, not relaxation.

D. Influx of calcium ions from outside the myocyte would also increase calcium concentrations and promote contraction, not relaxation.",Success

Which of the following would have been most effective in preventing this patient's current symptoms?""",E,"The correct answer is C. Rasburicase.

The patient's symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle cramps, are likely due to hyperuricemia (elevated uric acid levels) and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a complication of cancer treatment. The laboratory results show elevated uric acid levels (11.2 mg/dL) and other electrolyte abnormalities consistent with TLS.

Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase that converts uric acid to allantoin, a more soluble and easily excreted compound. It is commonly used to prevent and treat TLS in patients with high-risk malignancies, such as acute myelogenous leukemia. Administering rasburicase prior to chemotherapy would have been the most effective way to prevent the patient's current symptoms.

Urine alkalinization (A) may help increase uric acid excretion, but it is not as effective as rasburicase in preventing TLS. Corticosteroids (B) are not typically used to prevent TLS. Allopurinol (D) is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that can reduce uric acid production, but it takes several days to be effective and may not prevent TLS. Intravenous hydration (E) is important in preventing TLS, but it is not as effective as rasburicase in preventing the symptoms.",Success

His temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 108/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a wide-based gait. The patient is unable to stand with his feet together without support. There is a coarse tremor of the hands when he is asked to grab a pen. Muscle strength and tone are normal in all extremities. Sensation to pain, vibration, and position is intact bilaterally. Rapid alternating movements of the hands is impaired. Mental status examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Cerebellar degeneration.

The patient's symptoms, including multiple falls, dizziness, wide-based gait, and impaired rapid alternating movements of the hands, are consistent with cerebellar dysfunction. The presence of a coarse tremor of the hands and normal muscle strength and tone also support this diagnosis. The patient's history of heavy alcohol use and exposure to industrial solvents may be contributing factors to the development of cerebellar degeneration.

Korsakoff syndrome (A) is a chronic memory disorder that is often seen in patients with a history of alcoholism, but it does not typically present with cerebellar symptoms. Subacute combined degeneration (B) is a condition caused by vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause neurological symptoms, but it is not typically associated with cerebellar dysfunction. Methanol poisoning (C) can cause neurological symptoms, but it is typically associated with a more acute onset and a different set of symptoms.

"A 67-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a follow up appointment. He was released from the hospital 1 week ago for an appropriately managed ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); however, he has not filled any of his prescriptions and did not attend his follow up appointment as scheduled. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. His temperature is 97.5°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 167/118 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for jugular venous distention and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Echocardiography demonstrates an ejection fraction of 55%. Which of the following medications will have the greatest mortality benefit in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is C. Lisinopril.

The patient has a history of STEMI and hypertension, and currently has signs of heart failure (jugular venous distention and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema). Lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In the ACE Inhibitor Myocardial Infarction Collaborative Group trial, ACE inhibitors were found to reduce mortality in patients with myocardial infarction.

While beta blockers (such as atenolol, metoprolol succinate, and propranolol) are also important medications in the management of myocardial infarction and heart failure, the evidence for mortality benefit is strongest for ACE inhibitors in this patient population. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that may be useful in managing hypertension and edema, but it is not expected to have a significant mortality benefit in this patient.",Success
A 61-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of a productive cough and worsening shortness of breath. He has had frequent episodes of a productive cough over the past 3 years. He had smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit 1 year ago. He appears distressed. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. Chest auscultation reveals diffuse wheezes and coarse crackles. A chest x-ray shows increased lung lucency bilaterally and flattening of the diaphragm. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy?,A,"The correct answer is A. Prednisone and albuterol.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The chest x-ray findings of increased lung lucency and flattening of the diaphragm also support this diagnosis.

The most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for a COPD exacerbation is a combination of a bronchodilator (such as albuterol) and a corticosteroid (such as prednisone). Albuterol helps to relieve bronchospasm and improve lung function, while prednisone reduces inflammation and helps to improve symptoms.

Montelukast is a leukotriene modifier that is typically used to treat asthma, not COPD. Tiotropium is a long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator that is used for maintenance therapy in COPD, but it is not typically used as initial therapy for an exacerbation. Theophylline is a bronchodilator that can be used in COPD, but it is not as commonly used as albuterol and is often reserved for more severe cases. Roflumilast is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor that is used for maintenance therapy in COPD, but it is not typically used as initial therapy for an exacerbation.",Success

"A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine health examination. She feels well but asks for advice about smoking cessation. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 7 years. She has tried to quit several times without success. During the previous attempts, she has been extremely nervous and also gained weight. She has also tried nicotine lozenges but stopped taking them because of severe headaches and insomnia. She has bulimia nervosa. She takes no medications. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is D. Motivational interviewing.

The patient has a history of smoking and has tried to quit several times without success. She has also experienced side effects from nicotine lozenges and has bulimia nervosa. Given her complex medical and psychological history, the most appropriate next step would be to start with motivational interviewing to assess her readiness to quit smoking and to identify the barriers that have prevented her from quitting in the past. This approach would help to build her motivation and confidence to quit smoking, and then other evidence-based treatments such as nicotine replacement therapy or prescription medications like varenicline could be considered.

Diazepam (A) is not an appropriate choice for smoking cessation, and it may even be contraindicated in a patient with bulimia nervosa due to the risk of dependence and abuse. Nicotine patch (B) may be a useful treatment for smoking cessation, but it would not be the first step in this patient's management given her history of side effects from nicotine lozenges. Varenicline (C) is a prescription medication that can be effective for smoking cessation, but it may not be the best choice for this patient given her history of bulimia nervosa and the potential for psychiatric side effects.

In the ED, he has a blood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, a pulse of 88/min, a respiratory rate of 28/min, and a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F). On physical examination, he has jugular vein distention, displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), an S4-gallop, a holosystolic murmur, and 2+ pitting edema up to the mid calf.  He is started on furosemide, carvedilol, and oxygen therapy. After 6-hours of continued therapy, his blood pressure remains low, and his serum creatinine is found to be 1.9 mg/dL. Which of the following test would be more useful to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease?",D,"The correct answer is D. Fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea).

The patient's presentation is consistent with heart failure, and the low blood pressure and elevated serum creatinine suggest possible acute kidney injury (AKI). The differential diagnosis includes prerenal AKI (due to decreased perfusion of the kidneys) versus intrinsic AKI (due to kidney damage).

The fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) is a useful test to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic AKI. FEUrea is calculated as the ratio of urea clearance to creatinine clearance. In prerenal AKI, the FEUrea is typically low (<35-40%), indicating that the kidneys are conserving urea in response to decreased perfusion. In intrinsic AKI, the FEUrea is typically high (>50-60%), indicating that the kidneys are not able to conserve urea due to damage.

The other options are not as useful in differentiating between prerenal and intrinsic AKI:

A. Sulfosalicylic acid test is used to detect proteinuria, which is not specific to AKI.

B. Urine sodium content can be low in both prerenal and intrinsic AKI.

C. Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa+) can be low in prerenal AKI, but it can also be low in some cases of intrinsic AKI, such as acute tubular necrosis.

Which of the following skin manifestations would you also expect to find in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Diffuse maculopapular rash.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) caused by an allergic reaction to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and diclofenac. AIN is often accompanied by a skin rash, which is typically a diffuse maculopapular rash. This type of rash is characterized by small, flat, and discolored patches on the skin that can appear anywhere on the body.

On physical examination, she has regular heart sounds but does have 1+ pitting edema to her bilateral lower extremities. What is her New York Heart Association Functional Classification for congestive heart failure?",D,"The correct answer is D. New York Heart Association Class III.

The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification is a system used to classify the severity of heart failure based on the patient's symptoms and functional capacity. The classification is as follows:

* Class I: No symptoms and no limitation in physical activity.
* Class II: Mild symptoms and slight limitation in physical activity.
* Class III: Marked limitation in physical activity due to symptoms, even during less-than-ordinary activity, but comfortable at rest.
* Class IV: Severe limitations in physical activity due to symptoms, even at rest.

In this case, the patient is experiencing symptoms of congestive heart failure, such as shortness of breath and fatigue, even with simple tasks like getting ready in the morning. However, her symptoms are alleviated when she sits down, indicating that she is comfortable at rest. This corresponds to NYHA Class III, as she has marked limitation in physical activity due to symptoms, even during less-than-ordinary activity, but is comfortable at rest.",Success

Which of the following statements best describes the cause of this patient’s glucosuria?",C,"The correct answer is C. Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules.

The patient's urinalysis shows glucosuria (199 mg/dl), which is a common finding in diabetes mellitus. In this case, the glucosuria is due to the high blood glucose levels, which exceed the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption. Normally, glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal renal tubules through secondary active transport, a process that involves the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2). However, when blood glucose levels are high, the capacity of SGLT2 to reabsorb glucose is exceeded, resulting in glucosuria.

The other options are not correct:

A. Yeast metabolism does not contribute to glucosuria.

B. Primary active transport is not directly involved in glucose reabsorption in the renal tubules.

D. Passive transport is not the primary mechanism of glucose reabsorption in the renal tubules.

On physical exam the patient has decreased passive and active range of motion of his shoulder. Strength of the patient's upper extremity is 4/5. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Adhesive capsulitis.

The patient's symptoms of stiffness in the arm, difficulty combing hair and reaching high objects, and decreased passive and active range of motion of the shoulder are consistent with adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder. The patient's sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity may have contributed to the development of this condition.

Rotator cuff impingement (A) typically presents with pain and weakness in the shoulder, especially with overhead activities. Biceps tendinopathy (C) typically presents with pain and tenderness in the front of the shoulder. Glenohumeral osteoarthritis (D) typically presents with pain and stiffness in the shoulder, but would likely have more prominent radiographic findings. Subacromial bursitis (E) typically presents with pain and inflammation in the shoulder, especially with overhead activities.

Which of the following underlies the patient’s most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Toxic exposure.

The patient's symptoms of headache and dizziness, which resolve when he steps outside, suggest carbon monoxide poisoning. The laboratory results showing elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are also consistent with this diagnosis, as carbon monoxide can cause an increase in red blood cell production.

A week after discharge, the patient forgot to take her medication for a few days and quickly began to manifest manic symptoms again which required brought her to the emergency department again. Since then, she has been compliant with her medications and currently has no significant complaints. Which of the following recommendations would be most helpful in minimizing the risk to the fetus in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is B. Supplement all patients with 5mg of daily folic acid.

The patient is a 20-year-old woman with bipolar I disorder, and the question is asking about minimizing the risk to the fetus. This implies that the patient is planning to become pregnant or is already pregnant. Lithium, the medication she is taking, is known to have potential teratogenic effects, particularly in the first trimester.

Supplementing with folic acid is a standard recommendation for all women of childbearing age, especially those taking medications that may increase the risk of birth defects. Folic acid has been shown to reduce the risk of neural tube defects, which are a concern with certain medications used to treat bipolar disorder.

The other options are not correct:

A. Adjusting the dosage of medication throughout pregnancy may be necessary, but it is not the most important recommendation for minimizing the risk to the fetus.

C. Low-dose polytherapy is not necessarily preferred over monotherapy in pregnancy, and the safest approach would depend on the individual patient's needs and medication regimen.

D. Discontinuing the medication when conception is confirmed is not a recommended approach, as it may lead to a relapse of symptoms and potentially harm the mother and fetus.

There is marked tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic region and right lower quadrant, with voluntary guarding but no rebound. Pelvic exam shows moderate purulent discharge in the vaginal vault, cervical motion tenderness, and a tender adnexal mass on the right side. Which of the following is the best next step in treating this patient’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline with inpatient admission.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is a serious infection of the female reproductive organs. The patient's recent treatment with ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection may have contributed to the development of PID by altering the normal vaginal flora.

The patient's symptoms, including fever, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, suggest a more severe infection that requires inpatient admission and intravenous antibiotics. The presence of a tender adnexal mass on the right side also suggests a tubo-ovarian abscess, which is a complication of PID that requires more aggressive treatment.

Intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline are appropriate antibiotics for the treatment of PID, and inpatient admission is necessary to monitor the patient's response to treatment and to provide supportive care.

Option A is incorrect because outpatient treatment with oral antibiotics is not sufficient for a patient with severe symptoms and a tubo-ovarian abscess. Option C is incorrect because vancomycin is not typically used to treat PID. Option D is incorrect because methotrexate is not an antibiotic and is not used to treat PID. Option E is incorrect because exploratory laparotomy is not necessary at this point, and antibiotic treatment should be tried first.",Success
"A 72-year-old man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital for the evaluation of breathlessness and fatigue. His pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Further evaluation shows a systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg × min/L with an end-systolic volume of 80 mL. Which of the following describes the ejection fraction in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is C. 35%.

The end-systolic volume (ESV) is 80 mL, and the normal ESV is around 50 mL. The ejection fraction (EF) can be calculated using the formula:

EF = (SV / EDV) × 100

where SV is the stroke volume and EDV is the end-diastolic volume.

Since the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is 35 mm Hg × min/L, which is low, the patient is likely to have a high cardiac output. This means the stroke volume (SV) is likely to be high.

Given the ESV is 80 mL, and assuming a normal EDV of around 120 mL, the SV can be estimated as:

SV = EDV - ESV = 120 mL - 80 mL = 40 mL

Now, the EF can be calculated:

EF = (SV / EDV) × 100 = (40 mL / 120 mL) × 100 ≈ 33%

"A 24-year-old woman presents to the office for evaluation of intermittent vertigo for the past 2 days. She complains of vomiting and complete hearing loss in her left ear. The patient believes she had an ear infection in the same ear but never sought out treatment. She has a past medical history of uterine fibroids. She takes mifepristone daily to reduce the size of the fibroids. Her blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg, the heart rate is 68/min, the respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). The patient appears pale and in mild distress. Otoscopy reveals a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane is observed to be immobile as confirmed by the pneumatoscope. Pure-tone audiometry testing reveals hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear. Heart auscultation is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Nystagmus is positive to the right. MRI of the brain does not reveal a tumor or abscess. Her physician orders a complete blood count with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel, which show:
Hemoglobin 14.5 gm/dL
Hematocrit 43.2 %
White blood cells 14,500 /mm3
Platelets 312,000/mm3
Neutrophil 81.6%

K+ 4.3 mEq/L
Cl- 108 mmol/L
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL
Which of the following is the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient?",D,"The correct answer is C. Cefotaxime.

The patient presents with symptoms of vertigo, vomiting, and complete hearing loss in the left ear, which suggests a diagnosis of labyrinthitis or otitis media with labyrinthine involvement. The otoscopy findings of a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane and immobility of the tympanic membrane confirm the diagnosis of otitis media.

Given the patient's history of uterine fibroids and daily use of mifepristone, it is likely that she has a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, which is a common pathogen in otitis media. Cefotaxime is a third-generation cephalosporin that has good coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, making it the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient.

Ofloxacin (A) is a fluoroquinolone that is not typically used as a first-line agent for otitis media, and it may not have adequate coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefepime (B) is a fourth-generation cephalosporin that has good coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it is typically reserved for more severe infections or those that are resistant to other antibiotics. Amoxicillin (D) is a penicillin antibiotic that is not effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cephalexin (E) is a first-generation cephalosporin that is not effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",Success
"A 52-year-old woman presents to the emergency department due to severe pain of her first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. This pain started acutely, and she describes the pain as sharp. Her medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, and extensive alcohol use. She takes a number of medications but does not remember what they are. On physical exam, her right first MTP joint appears warm, swollen, erythematous, and exquisitely painful to the touch. After resolution of this acute episode, the patient is started on a drug to prevent recurrence of the symptoms. One month later on follow-up, she is found to have pancytopenia. Which of the following describes the mechanism of the drug most likely prescribed in this case?",D,"The correct answer is D. Inhibitor of xanthine oxidase.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with gout, a condition characterized by sudden and severe joint pain, typically in the big toe. The patient's medical history and physical exam findings support this diagnosis.

The drug most likely prescribed to prevent recurrence of gout symptoms is allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. Allopurinol works by reducing the production of uric acid, which is the underlying cause of gout.

The side effect of pancytopenia (a decrease in all blood cell types) is a known rare complication of allopurinol therapy.

The other options are not directly related to the treatment of gout or the development of pancytopenia:

A. Antibody to soluble factor: This could refer to a monoclonal antibody, but it's not related to gout treatment.

B. Inhibitor of microtubule polymerization: This is a mechanism of action for certain chemotherapy drugs, but it's not related to gout treatment.

C. Inhibitor of proximal tubule reabsorption: This is a mechanism of action for certain diuretics, but it's not related to gout treatment.

E. Recombinant enzyme: This could refer to a variety of enzymes, but it's not related to gout treatment or the development of pancytopenia.",Success
"A 59-year-old man complains of chest pain that has been present for 4 hours on the 5th day of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. 5 days ago, he had a burning sensation in his chest and discomfort in his left shoulder. Upon initial presentation to the hospital’s emergency department, he was diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and treated with alteplase. He has been under close observation since then. The patient now describes discomfort in his chest and left shoulder, somewhat similar in nature to what initially brought him into the hospital. A pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and a blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg are observed. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings. The patient’s ECG is difficult to interpret. Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility?",C,"The correct answer is C. Creatine kinase (CK-MB).

The patient is experiencing chest pain and discomfort in his left shoulder, similar to his initial symptoms, which suggests a possible re-infarction or extension of the initial myocardial infarction. CK-MB is a cardiac enzyme that is specifically released from the heart muscle during a myocardial infarction. An elevated level of CK-MB would be diagnostic of a new or ongoing myocardial infarction, making it the most useful laboratory test in this scenario.

The other options are not as specific to cardiac damage and would not provide the same level of diagnostic utility:

A. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is a liver enzyme that can be elevated in various conditions, including liver disease, but it is not specific to cardiac damage.

B. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme found in various tissues, including bone, liver, and kidneys, and is not specific to cardiac damage.

D. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme found in various tissues, including the heart, but it is not as specific to cardiac damage as CK-MB.

E. Troponin T is a cardiac marker that can be elevated in myocardial infarction, but it may not be as specific to the timing of the event as CK-MB, which is typically elevated earlier in the course of a myocardial infarction.",Success
"A 16-year-old girl comes to the emergency department because of left wrist pain and swelling for 5 hours. She fell on an outstretched hand while playing basketball. She ignored it initially as she thought it was just a bruise, but the pain and swelling worsened throughout the day. The analgesic spray she used did not provide adequate relief. There is no family history of serious illness. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive pill. Her immunizations are up-to-date. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37.1°C (99°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg. Examination shows a swollen and tender left wrist; range of motion is limited. The anatomical snuffbox is tender to palpation. The grip strength of the left hand is decreased. The thumb can be opposed towards the other fingers. Finkelstein's test is negative. X-rays of the wrist shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Thumb spica cast and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a scaphoid fracture, which is a common injury in young adults who fall on an outstretched hand. The tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox and decreased grip strength support this diagnosis. Although the initial X-rays do not show any abnormalities, scaphoid fractures can be difficult to diagnose on initial radiographs.

The most appropriate next step is to immobilize the wrist in a thumb spica cast and repeat the X-rays in 2 weeks. This allows for further evaluation and potential diagnosis of a scaphoid fracture, which may become more apparent on follow-up radiographs.

Open reduction and internal fixation (A) and percutaneous pinning (E) are not indicated at this stage, as the diagnosis is not yet confirmed. Corticosteroid injections (B) are not typically used for acute fractures. Rest, ice, and repeat X-rays in 2 weeks (D) may not provide adequate immobilization and may delay diagnosis and treatment.",Success
"A 46-year-old man comes to the physician with a 1-week history of yellowish discoloration of his eyes, generalized fatigue, and pruritus. He was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 7 years ago. At the time of diagnosis, a pANCA test was also positive. Physical examination shows scleral icterus and multiple scratch marks on the trunk and extremities. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Serum studies show a total bilirubin concentration of 3.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin concentration of 2.5 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase level of 450 U/L. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography shows focal areas of intrahepatic bile duct strictures alternating with areas of dilation. Histologic examination of a liver biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?",A,"The correct answer is A. Periductal concentric scarring and fibrosis.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. The magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) findings of focal areas of intrahepatic bile duct strictures alternating with areas of dilation are also consistent with PSC.

On liver biopsy, PSC is typically characterized by periductal concentric scarring and fibrosis, which is the correct answer. This finding is often referred to as ""onion skin"" fibrosis due to the concentric layers of fibrosis surrounding the bile ducts.

The other options are not correct:

B. Periportal lymphocytic infiltration and piecemeal necrosis are more characteristic of chronic hepatitis, such as autoimmune hepatitis.

C. Diffuse fibrosis with PAS-staining globules is more characteristic of glycogen storage diseases, such as von Gierke disease.

D. Irregular ductal glands lined by atypical and pleomorphic cells are more characteristic of cholangiocarcinoma, a malignant tumor of the bile ducts.

E. Ductopenia and fibrotic degeneration of periportal hepatocytes are more characteristic of vanishing bile duct syndrome, a rare condition characterized by the loss of intrahepatic bile ducts.",Success
"A 29-year-old woman presents to her primary care doctor with a lesion on her left labia. She first noticed the lesion 3 days ago. The patient describes the lesion as painful and swollen. She denies vaginal discharge. Her past medical history is notable for mild intermittent asthma, gout, and obesity. She uses an albuterol inhaler as needed and takes allopurinol. She has had 5 sexual partners in the past year and uses the pull-out method for contraception. She has a 10-pack-year smoking history and drinks 10-12 alcoholic beverages per week. On exam, she has an ulcerated, tender, and purulent ulcer on the left labia majora. The patient has mild unilateral painful inguinal lymphadenopathy. This patient's condition is most likely caused by which of the following pathogens?",C,"The correct answer is C. Haemophilus ducreyi.

The patient's symptoms, such as a painful and swollen ulcer on the labia, unilateral painful inguinal lymphadenopathy, and purulent discharge, are consistent with chancroid, a sexually transmitted infection caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Chancroid is a common cause of genital ulcers in developing countries and is often seen in people with a history of multiple sexual partners and inconsistent condom use.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Klebsiella granulomatis is a bacterium that causes granuloma inguinale, a chronic and relatively painless genital ulcer disease.

B. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) can cause genital ulcers, but they are typically multiple, shallow, and bilateral, and may be accompanied by systemic symptoms like fever and malaise.

D. Gardnerella vaginalis is a bacterium that causes bacterial vaginosis, a condition characterized by abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, and itching, but not typically painful ulcers.

On many occasions, his mind will be racing with thoughts that keep him up at night. During these moments, he finds his heart racing and feels light-headed and dizzy to the point of blacking out. He has also been experiencing back and neck pain with increased muscle tension in these areas. The patient reports no smoking or alcohol use but mentions that he had tried cocaine and heroin in his 20s and 30s. Which of the following would be the best course of treatment for this patient’s symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Buspirone.

The patient's symptoms, including feelings of nervousness and anxiety, restlessness, racing thoughts, and physical symptoms such as heart racing, lightheadedness, and muscle tension, are consistent with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

Buspirone is a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic that is commonly used to treat GAD. It has a slower onset of action compared to benzodiazepines, but it is less likely to cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms.

Diazepam (A) and alprazolam (E) are benzodiazepines that can be effective for anxiety, but they have a higher risk of dependence and withdrawal symptoms, especially in older adults.

Zolpidem (B) is a sedative-hypnotic that is used to treat insomnia, but it is not typically used to treat anxiety.

Ramelteon (C) is a melatonin receptor agonist that is used to treat insomnia, but it is not typically used to treat anxiety.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of substance abuse in the past may make benzodiazepines a less desirable option, as they can be habit-forming. Buspirone is a safer choice in this case.",Success

Cervical examination shows 100% effacement and 10 cm dilation. A cardiotocograph is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?",C,"The correct answer is D. Repositioning.

The cardiotocograph (CTG) shows a non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern, specifically a variable deceleration. This can be caused by umbilical cord compression, which can be relieved by repositioning the mother.

On physical exam, you notice the patient has decreased position sense and a loss in vibratory sensation in her lower extremities. Which of the following is most likely present in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with pernicious anemia, a condition characterized by a lack of intrinsic factor, a protein necessary for vitamin B12 absorption. The presence of neutrophils with 7 lobes (hypersegmented neutrophils) and large oval-shaped red blood cells on the peripheral blood smear, along with the patient's symptoms of weakness, light-headedness, and soreness of the tongue, suggest a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency.

The patient's past medical history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and the presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies support this diagnosis. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies are a common finding in patients with pernicious anemia and are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Atrophy of G cells is related to gastrin-producing cells and is not directly related to vitamin B12 deficiency.

C. Decreased methylmalonic acid levels would suggest an improvement in vitamin B12 status, not a deficiency.

D. Antithrombotic state is not related to vitamin B12 deficiency or pernicious anemia.

Which of the following procedures is the most appropriate for elective termination of pregnancy in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is A. Dilatation and evacuation (D&E).

The patient is 5 weeks pregnant, and the most appropriate method for elective termination of pregnancy at this gestational age is dilatation and evacuation (D&E). D&E is a surgical procedure that involves dilating the cervix and using suction or forceps to remove the pregnancy tissue from the uterus. It is a safe and effective method for terminating pregnancies up to 12-14 weeks of gestation.

Manual uterine aspiration (option C) is also a possible option, but it is typically used for earlier pregnancies (up to 6-7 weeks). Dilatation and curettage (D&C) after vacuum evacuation (option D) is not necessary in this case, as D&E is a more straightforward and effective procedure.

His past medical history is significant for diabetes, hypertension, and early stage prostate cancer that was removed 10 years ago without recurrence. He has smoked 1 pack per day for the past 55 years and drinks about 6 drinks per week. On presentation he is found to be breathing with pursed lips. Physical exam reveals decreased breath sounds on auscultation, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion. Which of the following findings would most likely be seen in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is likely caused by his 55-year history of smoking. The physical exam findings of pursed-lip breathing, decreased breath sounds, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion are all characteristic of COPD.

In COPD, the lungs become damaged and lose their elasticity, leading to air trapping and an increase in residual volume (RV). The 1-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) is also decreased due to the obstruction of airflow. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume.",Success

Volume: 30 cc of fluid
Pleural fluid protein: 5.8 g/dL
Serum protein ratio: 7.0 g/dL
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 258 U/L

Which of the following conditions may have led to the findings in this patient’s pleural cavity?",D,"The correct answer is A. Congestive heart failure.

The pleural fluid analysis results are consistent with a transudative effusion, which is typically caused by increased hydrostatic pressure or decreased oncotic pressure. The key findings are:

* Pleural fluid protein: 5.8 g/dL (normal < 3.0 g/dL)
* Serum protein ratio: 7.0 g/dL (normal > 0.5)
* LDH: 258 U/L (normal < 200 U/L)

She reports that diphenhydramine has been helpful in controlling her symptoms, but she does not like feeling drowsy from the medication. Her past medical history is also notable for well-controlled asthma. She uses an albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis. She smokes marijuana daily. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 16/min. She has a prominent nasal crease. Her nasal turbinates are boggy and bluish-gray. She has copious thin and watery nasal mucus. The physician suggests replacing diphenhydramine with fexofenadine to improve her drowsiness. What characteristic of fexodenadine allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine?",D,"The correct answer is D. Relative lipophobicity.

Fexofenadine is a non-sedating antihistamine, which means it is less likely to cause drowsiness compared to diphenhydramine. This is due to its relative lipophobicity, which refers to its low ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. As a result, fexofenadine has a lower affinity for the central nervous system and is less likely to cause sedation.

Diphenhydramine, on the other hand, is a lipophilic antihistamine, which means it can easily cross the blood-brain barrier and cause sedation.

The other options are not correct:

The patient has small esophageal varices with red spots, which indicates a high risk of bleeding. The next best step to prevent bleeding is to perform endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL). EVL is a procedure where rubber bands are placed around the varices to constrict them and prevent bleeding. This is a more effective and safer option compared to endoscopic sclerotherapy (Option A).

Options C and D, metoprolol and nadolol, are beta-blockers that can be used to reduce portal pressure and prevent bleeding, but they are not as effective as EVL in this scenario.

Option E, repeat endoscopy, is not necessary at this time, as the patient has already had a recent endoscopy that revealed the presence of small esophageal varices with red spots.",Success
"A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife for incomprehensible speech. Upon first inspection you note the man is drooling and his eyes are tearing excessively. The patient's wife explains that the man was tilling the fields on the family beet farm when she found him collapsed on a pile of freshly picked beets. The patient seemed confused so the wife brought him in promptly, and states it has only been ten minutes since the patient was found down in the fields. Physical exam is deferred due to a confused and combative patient who is speaking clearly yet his sentences do not make any sense. The patients clothes are removed in the ED. Vital signs are currently being obtained. Which of the following is the best initial step in management?",D,"The correct answer is A. Sublingual atropine drops.

The patient's symptoms, including incomprehensible speech, drooling, and excessive tearing, are consistent with organophosphate poisoning, which is a common hazard in agricultural settings. The fact that the patient was found collapsed in a field where beets were being harvested suggests that he may have been exposed to an organophosphate pesticide.

Sublingual atropine drops are a common antidote for organophosphate poisoning and can help to counteract the effects of the toxin on the nervous system. Atropine works by blocking the action of acetylcholine, which is overstimulated by organophosphates.

The other options are not correct because:

* Neostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that can actually worsen organophosphate poisoning.
* Physostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that can be used to treat anticholinergic poisoning, but it is not effective against organophosphate poisoning.
* 2-Pralidoxime (2-PAM) is an oxime that can be used to treat organophosphate poisoning, but it is typically given in conjunction with atropine and is not the best initial step in management.
* Intubation may be necessary if the patient's condition deteriorates, but it is not the best initial step in management.",Success
"A 75-year-old man presents to the physician for his annual blood pressure visit and blood work. He has no complaints other than occasional knee pain. The past medical history includes hypertension. He has had knee osteoarthritis for several years and takes occasional acetaminophen for pain control. His diet is full of vegetables. He exercises every day. He has no history of smoking. He had a brother who died at the age of 84 due to hematologic malignancy. The temperature is 36.8℃ (98.2℉), and the blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. The physical examination shows no abnormalities other than a reduced range of motion and crepitus in both knees. The laboratory test results are as follows:
Hemoglobin 15 g/dL
Leukocyte count 58,000/mm3
Platelet count 250,000/mm3
Flow cytometry on the peripheral blood reveals an absolute lymphocyte count of 50,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

The patient's laboratory results show a significantly elevated leukocyte count (58,000/mm3) with a high absolute lymphocyte count (50,000/mm3). This suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder. The most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. CLL is characterized by the abnormal growth of lymphocytes, which can lead to an elevated white blood cell count.

The other options are less likely:

B. Monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a precursor condition to CLL, but it is typically characterized by a lower absolute lymphocyte count (<5,000/mm3).

C. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a condition characterized by the presence of a monoclonal protein in the blood, but it is not typically associated with an elevated leukocyte count.

D. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow, but it is typically characterized by anemia, bone lesions, and an elevated monoclonal protein level, which are not present in this patient.

E. Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an overproduction of red blood cells, which is not consistent with the patient's laboratory results.",Success
A 60-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of cough productive of yellow sputum with occasional streaks of blood. He has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. He is afebrile. Pulmonary examination shows inspiratory crackles at the left infraclavicular area. An x-ray of his chest shows a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning. A sputum sample does not grow acid-fast bacteria despite multiple cultures. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?,D,"The correct answer is D. Opportunistic colonization.

The patient's symptoms and chest x-ray findings are consistent with a diagnosis of aspergilloma, a fungal ball that forms in a pre-existing lung cavity. The fact that the radiopaque mass shifts upon repositioning suggests that it is a mobile object within the lung cavity. The patient's history of pulmonary tuberculosis increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as tuberculosis can cause lung cavities that can be colonized by Aspergillus fungi. The lack of growth of acid-fast bacteria on sputum culture further supports this diagnosis, as Aspergillus is not acid-fast.",Success
"An 11-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother after she observed jerking movements of his arms and legs for about 30 seconds earlier that morning. He has not had fever, cough, or a runny nose. He has been healthy, except for occasional eczema. He was delivered at home in Romania. His mother had no prenatal care. She reports that he has required more time to reach developmental milestones compared to his older brother. The patient's immunization records are not available. He takes no medications. He appears pale with blue eyes and has a musty odor. He has poor eye contact. Which of the following would have most likely prevented the patient's symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine.

The patient's symptoms, including jerking movements, pale skin, blue eyes, musty odor, and poor eye contact, are consistent with phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. PKU can cause intellectual disability, seizures, and other neurological symptoms if left untreated.

A dietary restriction of phenylalanine, which is an essential amino acid, is the primary treatment for PKU. This involves limiting the intake of phenylalanine-rich foods, such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, and some artificial sweeteners.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms:

A. Levothyroxine therapy during pregnancy is used to treat hypothyroidism, which is not related to the patient's symptoms.

C. Daily allopurinol intake is used to treat gout and kidney stones, which are not related to the patient's symptoms.

D. Avoidance of fasting states is important for patients with certain metabolic disorders, such as hypoglycemia, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms.

E. High doses of vitamin B6 are used to treat certain genetic disorders, such as homocystinuria, but it is not related to the patient's symptoms.",Success
A researcher hypothesizes that low birth weight is related to obesity later in life. He conducts a study with a 95% confidence interval with a p-value of 0.049 to disprove his null hypothesis. He rejects his null hypothesis and concludes that low birth weight is associated with obesity. Which of the following statements best associates with his study?,B,"The correct answer is E. A type 1 error has been made.

Here's why:

* The researcher rejects the null hypothesis with a p-value of 0.049, which is just below the significance level of 0.05. This means that there is a 4.9% chance of observing the result (or a more extreme result) assuming that the null hypothesis is true.
* Since the p-value is close to the significance level, there is a possibility that the researcher has made a type 1 error, which is the error of rejecting a true null hypothesis.
* The other options are not correct:
	+ A. The confidence interval of 95% is appropriate for this study, and changing it to 90% would not affect the conclusion.
	+ B. A type 2 error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis) is still possible in this case, even though the null hypothesis was rejected.
	+ C. The null hypothesis was rejected based on the p-value, so it should be rejected.
	+ D. There is no evidence to suggest that a type 2 error has been made, as the null hypothesis was rejected.",Success
"A 52-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for abdominal pain and diarrhea. The patient states that she has been experiencing watery diarrhea for weeks now. During this same period she states she has been constantly thirsty and does not have the same energy levels that she once had. The patient has a past medical history of anxiety and depression and is currently taking fluoxetine. She was recently treated for a middle ear infection and sinusitis with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid one week ago. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 110/58 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.

Which of the following is associated with the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is E. Normal flora destruction.

The patient's symptoms of watery diarrhea, thirst, and fatigue, along with laboratory values showing hypokalemia (low potassium levels) and a mild metabolic acidosis, suggest a diagnosis of Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection. This is likely caused by the recent use of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, which disrupted the normal gut flora, allowing C. diff to overgrow and produce toxins that cause diarrhea.

Option E, Normal flora destruction, is the most likely associated factor with this diagnosis.",Success
"A 3-week-old newborn is brought to the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but the patient often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Rectal suction biopsy.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon. The explosive release of stool from the rectum during the rectal exam is a classic finding in Hirschsprung's disease.

A rectal suction biopsy is the most definitive diagnostic test for Hirschsprung's disease, as it allows for the examination of the rectal mucosa and submucosa for the presence or absence of ganglion cells. The biopsy can be performed at the bedside and is a relatively simple and safe procedure.

The other options are not as specific or diagnostic for Hirschsprung's disease:

A. CT scan of the abdomen: May show nonspecific findings such as bowel dilation, but is not diagnostic for Hirschsprung's disease.

B. Transabdominal ultrasonography: May show bowel dilation, but is not specific for Hirschsprung's disease.

C. Barium enema: May show a transition zone between the dilated and non-dilated colon, but is not as sensitive or specific as a rectal suction biopsy.

"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive left leg pain for 2 months, which has started to interfere with his sleep. His mother has been giving him ibuprofen at night for “growing pains,” but his symptoms have not improved. One week before the pain started, the patient was hit in the thigh by a baseball, which caused his leg to become red and swollen for several days. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. His gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. A biopsy of the left femur shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Ewing sarcoma.

The symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Ewing sarcoma, a type of bone cancer that typically affects children and adolescents. The patient's age, progressive leg pain, and elevated leukocyte count and ESR support this diagnosis. The x-ray findings of multiple lytic lesions in the femur with new bone formation are also characteristic of Ewing sarcoma. The biopsy result showing small round blue cells is also consistent with this diagnosis.

Osteosarcoma (A) is also a type of bone cancer, but it typically affects older children and young adults, and the x-ray findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Chondrosarcoma (B) is a type of bone cancer that typically affects adults, and the x-ray findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Osteochondroma (C) is a benign bone tumor that typically affects the long bones of the limbs, but it does not typically cause pain or have the x-ray findings described in this case.

He is sweating profusely. The jugular venous pulse is visible 2.5 cm above the sternal angle. Auscultation reveals soft S1 and S2 heart sounds with an added S4 and bilateral inspiratory crackles at the lung bases. The electrocardiogram shows ST-elevations in leads V1 and V2. A diagnosis of an anteroseptal infarction is made. The patient was given aspirin on the way to the hospital. He is started on dopamine, morphine, nitroglycerin, and streptokinase. Which of the following would be the most concerning development over the next 24h this patient?",A,"The correct answer is C. Persistent ST-segment elevation.

The patient has been diagnosed with an anteroseptal infarction and has been started on streptokinase, a thrombolytic agent. The goal of thrombolytic therapy is to restore blood flow to the affected area of the heart and reduce the size of the infarct. Persistent ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram would indicate that the thrombolytic therapy has not been effective in restoring blood flow, and the infarct is continuing to evolve. This would be a concerning development, as it would suggest that the patient is at higher risk for further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even death.

The other options are not as concerning:

A. Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) is a possible side effect of thrombolytic therapy, but it is not a specific complication of anteroseptal infarction.

B. Easy fatigability is a common symptom in patients with heart failure, but it is not a specific complication of anteroseptal infarction.

HCO3-  26 mEq/L
Which of the following could explain this patient's presentation?",E,"The correct answer is E. Opioid overdose.

The patient's presentation is consistent with opioid overdose:

* Unresponsiveness to voice and touch, with a flexor response to pain, suggests a depressed level of consciousness.
* Shallow breathing and a respiratory rate of 7/min indicate respiratory depression.
* Constricted pupils are a classic sign of opioid overdose.
* The arterial blood gas results show a respiratory acidosis (pH 7.26, Pco2 70 mm Hg), which is consistent with hypoventilation.

Opioid overdose can cause respiratory depression, leading to a buildup of CO2 in the blood, which results in a respiratory acidosis. The other options do not fit the patient's presentation:

* A. COPD exacerbation would likely present with a more severe respiratory acidosis and a higher Pco2.

 ",C,"The correct answer is C. Vitamin B12 deficiency.

The patient's symptoms, such as repeated falls, postural dizziness, progressive fatigue, and generalized weakness, are consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency. The laboratory results, including a low hemoglobin level, high MCV, and hypersegmented neutrophils on the peripheral blood smear, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's behavioral changes, such as irritability, paranoia, and delusions, are common neuropsychiatric manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency.

While folate deficiency (option B) can also cause similar hematological abnormalities, it is less likely to cause the neuropsychiatric symptoms and ataxic gait seen in this patient. Pernicious anemia (option E) is a type of vitamin B12 deficiency caused by a lack of intrinsic factor, but the absence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies makes this diagnosis less likely.

His father and sister also have joint issues, and his mother was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis. He has been a smoker for 13 years. Upon physical examination, his wrist and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are warm and swollen. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Testing for serum ESR and autoantibodies.

The patient's symptoms, such as morning stiffness, joint pain and swelling, and improvement with physical activity, are consistent with inflammatory arthritis, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The presence of a family history of joint issues and osteoporosis also supports this diagnosis. The next step in management would be to order laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (anti-CCP).

Option A is incorrect because while calcium and PTH levels may be relevant in the context of osteoporosis, they are not directly related to the patient's current symptoms.

Option B is incorrect because while calcium and vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial for the patient's overall bone health, it is not the next best step in managing his current symptoms.

Option D is incorrect because ferritin levels are not directly related to the patient's symptoms, and testing for ferritin would not be a priority at this stage.

Further evaluation of this patient will most likely show which of the following?",E,"The correct answer is B. Achlorhydria.

The patient's symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and flushing, are consistent with carcinoid syndrome, which is caused by a neuroendocrine tumor that secretes serotonin and other vasoactive substances. The increased urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentration supports this diagnosis, as 5-HIAA is a metabolite of serotonin.

Achlorhydria, or the absence of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, is a common finding in patients with carcinoid syndrome, as the tumor can cause atrophic gastritis and reduce gastric acid production.

The yellow-green color of his sputum suggests a bacterial infection, and the patient's history of frequent hospitalizations for similar symptoms suggests that he may have a more resistant bacterial infection.

Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is commonly used to treat bacterial exacerbations of COPD, particularly those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common pathogen in patients with COPD. It has good coverage against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, making it a good choice for this patient.

Amoxicillin (Option A) is a penicillin-type antibiotic that may not have adequate coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefazolin (Option B) is a first-generation cephalosporin that is not typically used to treat COPD exacerbations. Ceftriaxone (Option C) is a third-generation cephalosporin that may be used to treat COPD exacerbations, but it is typically reserved for more severe infections or those that are resistant to other antibiotics. Penicillin (Option E) is not typically used to treat COPD exacerbations, as it has limited coverage against Gram-negative bacteria.",Success
"A 55-year-old man presents with bloody nasal secretions and shortness of breath. He reports he has lost 4 kg (8.8 lb) in the last two months with no changes in his diet. He has also been suffering from mild to moderate joint pain in the left knee for the last year. His past medical history is unremarkable. His vitals include: blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg, temperature 37.0℃ (98.6℉), pulse 70/min, respiratory rate 14/min. Physical examination is significant for nasal ulcers. Diffuse crackles are present over all lobes of the lung bilaterally. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL
Hematocrit 37.7%
Leukocyte count 5500/mm3
Neutrophils 65%
Lymphocytes 30%
Monocytes 5%
Mean corpuscular volume 82.2 μm3
Platelet count 190,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 35 mm/h
C-reactive protein 14 mg/dL
Creatinine 3.09 mg/dL
The patient is prescribed a corticosteroid nasal spray and oral antibiotics but returns in 2 weeks without any clinical improvement. Which of the following would most likely confirm the diagnosis in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies.

The patient's symptoms, including bloody nasal secretions, shortness of breath, and joint pain, are consistent with a diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), a type of vasculitis. The presence of nasal ulcers and diffuse crackles on lung examination further support this diagnosis.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are a hallmark of GPA and are present in the majority of patients with active disease. A positive ANCA test would confirm the diagnosis in this patient.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies are associated with rheumatoid arthritis, not GPA.

B. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a nonspecific marker of inflammation and is not diagnostic of GPA.

C. Anti-histone bodies are associated with drug-induced lupus, not GPA.

D. Anti-Ro is an autoantibody associated with Sjögren's syndrome and lupus, not GPA.",Success
"A 25-year-old Hispanic male presents with heat intolerance and recent weight loss. Serum analysis shows increased levels of T4 and T3, as well as the presence of thyroglobulin-stimulating immunoglobulins. The patient is found to be tachycardic and has marked edema and waxy discoloration in his legs. Which of the following would be consistent with this patient's disease?",C,"The correct answer is C. Exophthalmos.

The patient's symptoms, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, and tachycardia, are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The presence of thyroglobulin-stimulating immunoglobulins suggests Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism. The edema and waxy discoloration in the legs are likely due to pretibial myxedema, a skin condition that can occur in Graves' disease.

Exophthalmos, or bulging eyes, is a common feature of Graves' disease, particularly in patients with thyroglobulin-stimulating immunoglobulins. It is caused by inflammation and swelling of the tissues around the eyes.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's disease:

A. Sympathetic underactivity would not be expected in a patient with hyperthyroidism, who typically exhibits increased sympathetic activity.

B. Anti-thyroglobin antibodies may be present in some patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, but they are not typically associated with Graves' disease.

D. Increased TSH release would not be expected in a patient with hyperthyroidism, as the high levels of T4 and T3 would normally suppress TSH production.

E. Multinucleate giant cells are not typically seen in Graves' disease, but rather in subacute thyroiditis, a different thyroid disorder.",Success
"A 3-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for delayed passage of meconium. His mother is breastfeeding and has started to produce milk. The patient has been feeding well every two hours and is urinating over eight times per day. The patient was born at 35 weeks gestation to a 27-year-old gravida 4. The patient is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and the patient’s parents denied all prenatal genetic testing. The pregnancy was uncomplicated until the patient’s mother had spontaneous rupture of membranes at 35 weeks gestation. The patient’s three older siblings are all healthy. In the hospital nursery, the patient’s temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 48/32 mmHg, pulse is 164/min, and respirations are 48/min. On physical exam, he appears to be in moderate distress. He has no dysmorphic features, and his abdomen is distended and non-tender. Bowel sounds are absent.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Abdominal radiograph.

The patient's symptoms, such as delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension, and absent bowel sounds, suggest a possible intestinal obstruction. An abdominal radiograph is a non-invasive and quick test that can help identify signs of bowel obstruction, such as dilated loops of bowel or air-fluid levels. It is a good initial test to evaluate the patient's symptoms and guide further management.

An abdominal CT (Option A) may be too invasive and not necessary at this point, especially in a newborn. A contrast enema (Option C) may be useful in diagnosing specific conditions such as Hirschsprung's disease, but it is not the best initial test. An upper gastrointestinal series (Option D) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms. Sweat testing (Option E) is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, which is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms.",Success
"A 78-year-old woman presents to the office for an annual health check-up with her family physician accompanied by her daughter. She has no complaints during this visit but her daughter states that she is having difficulty locating objects such as the television remote, car keys, and her purse. Her medical history is significant for Alzheimer’s dementia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis and centrilobular emphysema. The patient takes memantine, atorvastatin, metformin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, aspirin, albuterol, and ipratropium. The patient’s vitals are within normal limits today. Physical exam reveals an elderly female in no acute distress, oriented to person, place and year, but not to month or day of the week. She has a 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border along with an S3 gallop. There are mild crackles at the lung bases. The remainder of the exam is normal. A previous urine culture reports growth of > 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter. Urinalysis findings are offered below:
Leukocyte esterase  positive
WBCs 50-100 cell/HPF
Nitrites positive
RBCs 2 cell/HPF
Epithelial cells 2 cell/HPF
Urine pH 5.7
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",E,"The correct answer is B. Nitrofurantoin.

The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) as evidenced by the positive leukocyte esterase, presence of WBCs, and positive nitrites on urinalysis. The urine culture previously grew > 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter, which is a common cause of UTIs.

Nitrofurantoin is a suitable choice for treating UTIs, especially in elderly patients, because it is less likely to cause Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea and has a lower risk of promoting antibiotic resistance. Additionally, nitrofurantoin is effective against Enterobacter.

TMP-SMX (A) is not a good choice because it can exacerbate the patient's underlying dementia due to its anticholinergic effects. Levofloxacin (C) is a fluoroquinolone that can increase the risk of tendon rupture and C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Cephalexin (D) is a cephalosporin that may not be effective against Enterobacter. No treatment (E) is not necessary because the patient has a symptomatic UTI that requires antibiotic treatment.",Success
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of painful ulcers in her mouth. Over the past 2 months, she has had increasing fatigue and difficulties concentrating. She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and was started on a new medication 4 months ago. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes and three tender ulcerative lesions in her mouth. Her hemoglobin concentration is 8.7 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume is 109 μm3. A blood smear shows hypersegmented neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?",D,"The correct answer is D. Deficient nitrogenous base production.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia, which is caused by a deficiency of vitamin B12 or folate. The presence of hypersegmented neutrophils on the blood smear is a characteristic feature of megaloblastic anemia. The patient's history of taking a new medication 4 months ago suggests that the medication may be causing the deficiency, possibly by interfering with vitamin B12 or folate absorption.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Deficient heme synthesis would cause a microcytic anemia, not a megaloblastic anemia.

B. Deficient DNA crosslink repair is related to Fanconi anemia, which is a rare genetic disorder.

C. Deficient erythropoietin secretion would cause anemia due to decreased red blood cell production, but it would not cause the characteristic laboratory findings of megaloblastic anemia.

Physical examination is significant for left-sided, tender, ulcerative lymph nodes with a dark discoloration. Which of the following is most likely to be seen in this patient's condition?",C,"The correct answer is A. Donovan bodies on Wright-Giemsa stain.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), a sexually transmitted infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. The presence of painful and ulcerative lymph nodes, especially with a dark discoloration, is characteristic of LGV. Donovan bodies, which are intracellular inclusions of C. trachomatis, can be seen on a Wright-Giemsa stain of a lymph node aspirate or biopsy.

Option B is incorrect because Gram-negative rods in a school of fish formation are characteristic of Haemophilus ducreyi, which causes chancroid.

Option C is incorrect because while C. trachomatis is the causative agent of LGV, PCR is not typically used to diagnose LGV.

Option D is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with syphilis, and the physical examination does not suggest a primary syphilitic chancre.

Option E is incorrect because Tzanck smear with multinucleated giant cells is characteristic of herpes simplex virus infection, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination.",Success

An acute ischemic stroke caused by distal left internal carotid artery occlusion with salvageable penumbral tissue is diagnosed based on a non-contrast CT scan, brain MRI, and catheter cerebral angiogram. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is given as treatment within 3 hours of presentation. Which of the following cellular processes is typical of the section of reversible injury noted in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Decreased ATP.

The patient has an acute ischemic stroke, and the section of reversible injury is referred to as the ""penumbra"". The penumbra is an area of brain tissue that is ischemic but not yet infarcted, and it is characterized by a decrease in ATP production due to reduced blood flow. This decrease in ATP leads to a failure of ion pumps, causing an influx of calcium and sodium ions, and an efflux of potassium ions, which can lead to cellular injury. However, this process is reversible with timely reperfusion, which is why the patient was treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Mitochondrial permeability is a feature of cellular necrosis, not reversible injury.

B. Caspase activation is a hallmark of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, which is not reversible.

C. Lysosomal rupture is a feature of cellular necrosis, not reversible injury.

He also complains of morning joint stiffness that improves with activity and reports feeling fatigued during the day. He started taking ibuprofen 2 months ago for the pain which initially subsided, but, over the last few weeks, it has worsened despite the medication. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 1 year ago and has had difficulty controlling his blood glucose levels. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol, or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a weight loss of 3.0 kg (6.6 lb) over the last 3 months despite no change in diet or activity level. Which of the following is the most likely 1st-line medication in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Methotrexate.

The patient's symptoms, such as symmetric joint pain and stiffness, morning joint stiffness, and fatigue, are consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and weight loss also support this diagnosis.

Methotrexate is a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) that is commonly used as a first-line treatment for RA. It has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms, slowing disease progression, and improving quality of life in patients with RA.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive medication that is typically used in more severe cases of RA or in combination with other medications.

B. Infliximab is a biologic DMARD that is used to treat RA, but it is typically reserved for patients who have not responded to methotrexate or other DMARDs.

C. Anakinra is an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist that is used to treat RA, but it is not typically used as a first-line medication.

A rectovaginal swab culture grows bacitracin-resistant colonies of gram-positive cocci with surrounding areas of clear hemolysis. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to decrease vertical transmission of this organism?",C,"The correct answer is C. Administer ampicillin intrapartum.

The description of the bacteria (bacitracin-resistant, gram-positive cocci with surrounding areas of clear hemolysis) suggests that the organism is Group B Streptococcus (GBS). GBS is a common cause of neonatal sepsis and meningitis, and vertical transmission from mother to baby can occur during delivery.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that pregnant women with GBS colonization receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) to prevent vertical transmission. The recommended antibiotic is penicillin or ampicillin, which is administered intravenously during labor.

The patient's presentation is consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which is a life-threatening condition characterized by the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results support this diagnosis:

* Multiple ecchymoses, petechiae, and purpura suggest bleeding and coagulopathy.
* The laceration over the clavicle that continues to bleed despite a pressure bandage suggests impaired hemostasis.
* The patient's oozing from the venepuncture sites further supports coagulopathy.
* The laboratory results show thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), prolongation of the PT and aPTT, and a normal white blood cell count, which are all consistent with DIC.

* Option B is incorrect. Apnea and hypopnea episodes are more likely to occur during lighter stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep, not deeper stages.
* Option C is incorrect. Mouth opening during sleep does not relieve airway obstruction in sleep apnea.
* Option D is correct. The most common site of pharyngeal airway collapse during sleep apnea is at the level of the base of the tongue, which can lead to obstruction of the airway.

A chest X-ray is performed and shown in the image below. Which of the following most likely accounts for the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is B. Lung compliance.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis, which is supported by the chest X-ray image. The presence of digital clubbing and bilateral basilar fine crackles on pulmonary auscultation are consistent with this diagnosis.

The increased expiratory flow rate in this patient is likely due to the increased lung compliance, which is a characteristic feature of pulmonary fibrosis. In pulmonary fibrosis, the lung tissue becomes stiff and non-compliant, leading to increased lung volumes and increased expiratory flow rates.

The other options are not directly related to the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient:

A. Anatomical dead space refers to the volume of air that is not involved in gas exchange, and is not related to expiratory flow rates.

C. Physiological dead space refers to the volume of air that is not involved in gas exchange due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch, and is also not directly related to expiratory flow rates.

PCT is a type of porphyria that is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, which leads to the accumulation of porphyrins in the skin and urine.

The laboratory results, including the presence of an anti-nuclear antibody titer of 1:320, suggest that the patient may have an underlying autoimmune disorder, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. However, this does not confirm the diagnosis of PCT.

The other options are not correct because:

A. Anti-dsDNA titers are typically elevated in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, but they do not confirm the diagnosis of PCT.

B. C-reactive protein is a nonspecific marker of inflammation and is not specific to PCT.

C. Anti-hemidesmosome titers are not typically associated with PCT.

E. Tzanck smear is a diagnostic test for herpes simplex virus infection, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Urine porphyrin levels would confirm the diagnosis of PCT by demonstrating elevated levels of uroporphyrins and heptacarboxyporphyrins in the urine.",Success
"A 64-year-old man presents with severe respiratory distress. This has onset over the past 3 weeks, progressively worsening. Past history involves congestive heart failure (CHF). Due to concerns of concurrent pneumonia, sputum studies are ordered. Microscopic examination of his sputum demonstrates heart failure cells (hemosiderin-containing macrophages). Which of the following cellular organelles is significant in the formation of these cells?",C,"The correct answer is C. Lysosomes.

Heart failure cells, also known as hemosiderin-containing macrophages, are formed when macrophages in the lungs phagocytose red blood cells that have leaked into the alveoli due to increased pressure and congestion in the pulmonary capillaries, often seen in congestive heart failure. The ingested red blood cells are broken down in the lysosomes, releasing hemoglobin, which is then converted to hemosiderin. The hemosiderin is then stored in the lysosomes, giving the macrophages their characteristic appearance.",Success
"A previously healthy 52-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after sustaining burns over 45% of her body in a house fire. On arrival, she is in acute distress but is fully oriented. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun and the patient is transferred to the intensive care unit of a burn center. 20 hours later, she has several large, tarry black stools and develops hypotension and tachycardia. Despite appropriate lifesaving measures, she dies. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools?",D,"The correct answer is E. Increased stomach acid production.

The patient's symptoms, including tarry black stools, hypotension, and tachycardia, are consistent with a diagnosis of Curling's ulcer, a type of stress ulcer that can occur in patients with severe burns. The most likely underlying cause of Curling's ulcer is increased stomach acid production, which can lead to mucosal damage and bleeding in the stomach.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care provider after feeling sad and depressed for the past several months. His wife divorced him about 6 months ago and took the kids and moved out of state. Since then he has had difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time. He takes some comfort in food and has gained about 9.1 kg (20 lb). He eats out several times a week and sometimes consumes 2 whole meals in one sitting. Other than this new obsession with eating large quantities of food and excess sleeping he no longer enjoys doing things he liked doing in the past. Besides eating and sleeping he is always excited to see his children and looks forward to their visits. He says it's the one thing keeping him going. Additionally, he does not feel like he has the same drive or focuses at work. He reports that he has no interest in hurting himself or others. His blood pressure is 119/81 mm Hg, pulse rate is 85/min, respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). His physical exam is normal. What other symptom is most likely present in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is B. Depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with major depressive disorder (MDD). The fact that he has difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time suggests that his depressive symptoms are worse in the morning, which is a common feature of MDD.",Success
"A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with acute shortness of breath that developed after a 10-hour international flight. His pulse is 124/min and pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 90%. He weighs 50-kg (110-lb). A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is suspected and intravenous heparin is initiated. If the volume of distribution of heparin is equivalent to 60 mL/kg and the target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL, which of the following is the most appropriate loading dose for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is A. 3,000 units.

To calculate the loading dose, you need to know the volume of distribution (Vd) and the target peak plasma concentration (Cp).

The formula to calculate the loading dose is:

Loading dose = Vd x Cp

Given values:
Vd = 60 mL/kg
Cp = 0.5 units/mL
Weight = 50 kg

First, calculate the volume of distribution in mL:
Vd (mL) = 60 mL/kg x 50 kg = 3000 mL

Then, calculate the loading dose:
Loading dose = Vd x Cp = 3000 mL x 0.5 units/mL = 1500 units x 2 (since 1 mL = 1 unit) = 3000 units

Therefore, the most appropriate loading dose for this patient is 3000 units.",Success
"A 45-year-old man presents to a surgeon with painless swelling over his right leg. He noticed the swelling 6 months ago, but he ignored it because it was painless. However, he is now concerned as the swelling has been increasing in size over the last 6 months. He also mentions that his father and brother have lipomas over the extremities. On physical examination, the swelling is well-circumscribed and non-tender, measuring approximately 4 x 5 cm. After evaluation, the surgeon performs a surgical resection of the tumor and sends the tissue for histopathological examination. The pathologist reports the tumor to be a liposarcoma rather than a lipoma. Which of the following enzymes is most likely to show increased activity in the cells of this patient’s tumor?",E,"The correct answer is E. Telomerase.

Liposarcoma is a type of cancer that arises from fat cells, and it is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and division. Telomerase is an enzyme that helps to maintain the length of telomeres, which are the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes. Telomerase activity is often increased in cancer cells, including liposarcoma, as it allows them to continue dividing indefinitely.

The other options are not directly related to liposarcoma or cancer cell growth:

A. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme involved in bone metabolism and is not typically associated with liposarcoma.

B. DNase is an enzyme that breaks down DNA and is not specifically related to liposarcoma.

C. RNase is an enzyme that breaks down RNA and is not directly related to liposarcoma.

D. Superoxide dismutase is an enzyme involved in antioxidant defenses and is not typically associated with liposarcoma.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a wellness visit. She says that she has been generally healthy but has noticed difficulty concentrating, becoming increasingly fatigued, and a 15-pound weight increase over the course of a few months. She also reports mild constipation and joint pain. Approximately 6-months ago, she experienced palpitations, increased stool frequency, and a hand tremor. Her past medical history is significant for asthma. Her father is not living and had Parkinson disease, and her mother has poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. She is currently sexually active in a monogamous relationship and uses contraception consistently. She denies cigarette smoking and occasionally drinks wine. She experimented once with lysergic acid diethylamide 6 years ago. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 127/98 mmHg, pulse is 55/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, the patient has slow speech and movement. She has tenderness to palpation of her wrist and ankle joints. She has delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following will most likely be found in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Elevated TSH.

The patient's symptoms, including difficulty concentrating, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, joint pain, and slow speech and movement, are consistent with hypothyroidism. The physical exam findings of delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes also support this diagnosis. Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. The patient's history of palpitations, increased stool frequency, and hand tremor 6 months prior to the visit may indicate a period of hyperthyroidism, which can precede hypothyroidism in some cases. An elevated TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level would confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.",Success

"An 80-year-old man presents with severe pain of the right lower extremity. He says that symptoms had an acute onset while he was in the ICU for a COPD exacerbation due to a recent upper respiratory infection, which was treated with nebulized albuterol and ipratropium bromide, continuous oxygen, IV methylprednisolone, and levofloxacin. He says he has been hospitalized 3 other times this year for COPD exacerbations. The medical history is significant for a left main coronary artery myocardial infarction after a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 2 months ago, mild cognitive impairment, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications are metformin, aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, atorvastatin, galantamine, and enalapril. He reports a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. His temperature is 39.0°C (102.5°F); blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg; pulse is 122/min; respiratory rate is 20/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. The physical examination is significant for the cutaneous finding shown in the picture. The involved area is severely tender to palpation and there are warmth and crepitus. A foul-smelling discharge is also noted. Pain seems out of proportion to the exam findings. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Immediate debridement and empiric IV antibiotics.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with necrotizing fasciitis, a life-threatening soft tissue infection that requires prompt treatment. The presence of severe pain, tenderness, warmth, crepitus, and foul-smelling discharge are all indicative of this condition. Immediate debridement of the affected area is necessary to remove dead tissue and reduce the bacterial load. Empiric IV antibiotics should also be started to cover for the likely causative organisms, which may include Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and anaerobes.

Option A, high-dose IV dexamethasone, is not indicated for the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis. Option D, biopsy of the wound, may be useful for diagnostic purposes, but it is not the next best step in management. Option E, contrast CT of the chest and abdomen, may be useful for evaluating the extent of the infection, but it is not as urgent as immediate debridement and antibiotic therapy.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after losing consciousness at work. On presentation, she is found to be somnolent though she is able to be woken by vocal stimuli. She says that over the last 12 hours, she has been experiencing muscle spasms, blurred vision, dry mouth, and hallucinations. She says that the symptoms started after she went on a hike in the woods and foraged from plants along the way. Physical exam reveals dry red skin and enlarged pupils. Her bladder is also found to be completely full though she says she is unable to urinate. Which of the following drugs would most likely be administered to this patient to treat her symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Physostigmine.

The patient's symptoms, including muscle spasms, blurred vision, dry mouth, hallucinations, dry red skin, enlarged pupils, and urinary retention, are consistent with anticholinergic toxicity. The fact that she foraged for plants on a hike suggests that she may have ingested a plant with anticholinergic properties, such as jimsonweed or deadly nightshade.

Physostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that can help reverse anticholinergic toxicity by increasing the levels of acetylcholine in the body. It is often used to treat anticholinergic poisoning, particularly when symptoms are severe or life-threatening.

Atropine (A) is an anticholinergic medication that would worsen the patient's symptoms. Pralidoxime (C) is used to treat organophosphate poisoning, not anticholinergic toxicity. Pyridostigmine (D) and neostigmine (E) are also cholinesterase inhibitors, but they are not typically used to treat anticholinergic toxicity.",Success

An investigator is studying bacterial adaptations to the environment in an infectious isolate and a noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B. Animals exposed to the noninfectious isolate do not develop symptoms of infection. The investigator cultivates the noninfectious isolate in a culture with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate. Some of the animals exposed to these bacteria develop symptoms of infection. Which of the following processes is most likely responsible for the described findings?,C,"The correct answer is C. Transformation.

The scenario described suggests that the noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B acquired genetic material from the infectious isolate, which allowed it to become infectious. This is consistent with the process of transformation, where free DNA from one bacterium is taken up by another bacterium, allowing for the transfer of genetic traits.

Conjugation (A) involves the direct transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another through a physical connection. Reassortment (B) is a process that occurs in viruses, not bacteria.

Her current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, albuterol, oral contraceptives, and a multivitamin. Her physical examination is unremarkable. Her blood pressure is 116/82 mm Hg and her heart rate is 82/min. You decide to initiate colesevelam (Welchol). Of the following, which is a concern with the initiation of this medication?",D,"The correct answer is D. Timing of the dosing of colesevelam should be separated from this patient’s other medications.

Colesevelam is a bile acid sequestrant that can bind to other medications and reduce their absorption. Therefore, it is recommended to separate the dosing of colesevelam from other medications, such as oral contraceptives, levothyroxine, and multivitamins, to minimize potential interactions.",Success
"A 62-year-old patient with a history of deep venous thrombosis is enrolled in a clinical trial for a new oral anticoagulant. This novel drug has the property where its clearance is relatively predictable based on patient demographics and can easily be extrapolated from other data. Its metabolism and volume of distribution also do not change dramatically from patient to patient. The investigator wants to make sure that the plasma concentration of the drug in this patient is 15 mg/L and he knows the following drug characteristics.

Bioavailability: 50%
Drug half-life: 2 hours
Volume of distribution: 14.3 liters

Which of the following represents the maintenance dose that should be given to this patient every 8 hours?",D,"To solve this problem, we can use the following formula:

Maintenance dose = (Target concentration x Volume of distribution) / (Bioavailability x Dosing interval) x (1 - e^(-k \* dosing interval))

where k is the elimination rate constant, which can be calculated from the half-life:

k = 0.693 / half-life = 0.693 / 2 = 0.3465 hour^-1

First, let's convert the dosing interval from 8 hours to hours:

Dosing interval = 8 hours = 8 hour

Now, plug in the values:

Maintenance dose = (15 mg/L x 14.3 L) / (0.5 x 8 hour) x (1 - e^(-0.3465 hour^-1 \* 8 hour))
Maintenance dose ≈ 357.15 mg

"A 7-day-old infant boy presents to an emergency department due to poor feeding. His parents are recent immigrants to the United States. He was born in a traditional home birth and has never seen a medical provider. Mom had no prenatal care, has no medical issues, and is unvaccinated. The baby had been breastfeeding well until 24 hours ago when mom noticed he started having trouble latching. In the last 12 hours, he has completely refused to feed. He has had a decreased number of wet diapers and has stooled twice in the last 24 hours. His temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 52/min, and blood pressure is 70/50 mmHg. On exam, the infant has increased tone, a clenched jaw, no head lag, and clenched hands. Initial screening bloodwork is normal. What is the most likely organism causing this infant's presentation?",B,"The correct answer is B. Clostridium tetani.

The symptoms described, such as increased tone, clenched jaw, and clenched hands, are consistent with tetanus neonatorum, a rare but serious condition caused by Clostridium tetani infection. The lack of prenatal care and vaccination in the mother, as well as the home birth, increase the risk of tetanus infection in the infant. The normal initial screening bloodwork also supports this diagnosis, as tetanus is not typically associated with abnormal laboratory results.",Success
"A 28-year-old woman presents with facial flushing, weakness, and chronic diarrhea for the past month. She denies any history of smoking, alcohol use, or recreational drug use. The patient was on a trip to Thailand 2 years ago with her family but denies any recent travel. Her blood pressure is 120/88 mm Hg, pulse is 78/min, temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), and respiratory rate is 16/min. Laboratory findings are unremarkable, except for a potassium level of 3.3 mmol/L and serum calcium of 11 mg/dL. The attending physician suspects that this might be a case of a genetic mutation in the menin 1 gene on chromosome 11 and orders a genetic analysis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. VIPoma.

The patient's symptoms, such as facial flushing, weakness, and chronic diarrhea, are consistent with a VIPoma (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide-secreting tumor). The laboratory findings, including hypokalemia (low potassium level) and hypercalcemia (high calcium level), also support this diagnosis. VIPomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors that can occur in the pancreas and other organs, and they are often associated with genetic mutations, including those in the MEN1 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1) gene on chromosome 11.",Success
"A 69-year-old gentleman presents to his primary care physician for pain in his right shoulder. The patient was helping his son move this past weekend, and he noticed after the move that he had pain and weakness in his right shoulder. The patient thought that this pain was just him being in poor shape so he started going to the gym and lifting weights which made his symptoms significantly worse. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, obesity, and asthma. His current medications include albuterol, lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide. On physical exam you note an obese gentleman who seems to be in pain. You note prominent weakness of external rotation of his right upper extremity. When you ask the patient to slowly lower his right arm to his side when he holds it overhead, you note that he suddenly drops his arm and appears to be in pain. The patient's strength is 1/5 for abduction of the right arm. Which of the following is most likely injured in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Supraspinatus.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with a supraspinatus tendon injury or tear. The supraspinatus muscle is responsible for abduction of the arm, and weakness in this movement is a key finding in this patient. The sudden dropping of the arm when lowering it from an overhead position, known as a ""drop arm"" sign, is also a characteristic finding in supraspinatus tendon injuries. Additionally, the patient's history of lifting weights, which made his symptoms worse, is also consistent with a supraspinatus tendon injury.",Success
"A 9-year-old male visited his primary care physician for a check-up three months after a throat infection. Upon examination, the patient exhibits painless subcutaneous nodules on the back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees, as well as inflammation in the joints of the lower extremities. Which of the following symptoms is most likely to also be present in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Chorea.

The patient's symptoms, including painless subcutaneous nodules on the back of the wrist, outside elbow, and front of the knees, as well as inflammation in the joints of the lower extremities, are consistent with a diagnosis of post-streptococcal reactive arthritis (PSRA). PSRA is a complication of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection, which can occur weeks to months after the initial infection.

Chorea, also known as Sydenham's chorea, is a neurological manifestation of PSRA, characterized by involuntary, rapid, and purposeless movements of the hands, feet, or face. It is a common symptom of PSRA, especially in children.

The other options are not directly related to PSRA:

A. Renal failure is a complication of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, a different complication of GABHS infection.

B. Hepatomegaly (enlargement of the liver) is not typically associated with PSRA.

"A 29-year-old man diagnosed with schizophrenia 4 years ago presents for follow-up to discuss his medication. The patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia 4 years ago and has since tried several antipsychotic medications, none of which have been able to treat his negative symptoms. He has changed to clozapine 2 weeks ago and says that he does feel better. His physical exam is unremarkable, and he is responding appropriately to questioning. If this patient’s current medication is to be continued, which of the following laboratory tests should be ordered at this time?
 ",D,"The correct answer is D. Complete blood count.

Clozapine is an antipsychotic medication that can cause agranulocytosis, a potentially life-threatening decrease in white blood cell count. Therefore, it is essential to monitor the patient's complete blood count (CBC) regularly, especially during the first few months of treatment. This is a black box warning for clozapine.

The other options are not directly related to the monitoring of clozapine therapy:

A. Slit-lamp examination is used to evaluate the eyes for cataracts, which is a side effect of some antipsychotics, but not specifically related to clozapine.

B. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is used to monitor cardiac function, which is not a primary concern with clozapine therapy.

C. Prolactin level is used to monitor for hyperprolactinemia, which is a side effect of some antipsychotics, but not typically associated with clozapine.

"A 32-year-old man with HIV comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of weight loss, night sweats, and productive cough. Auscultation of the lungs shows coarse crackles at the right upper posterior field. An x-ray of the chest shows an opacity in the right upper lobe. Sputum analysis shows acid-fast bacilli. A small amount of tuberculin fluid is injected into the subcutaneous tissue on the left forearm. Examination of the injected area 48 hours later shows no induration or erythema. Impairment of which of the following processes is the most likely cause of the negative tuberculin skin test seen in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands.

The patient's negative tuberculin skin test suggests anergy, which is a state of immune unresponsiveness. The tuberculin skin test is a type of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction, which requires the interaction of T cells with antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The interaction between B7 ligands on APCs and CD28 on T cells is a crucial step in the activation of T cells and the generation of a DTH response. Impairment of this interaction would lead to a negative tuberculin skin test.

The other options are not directly related to the tuberculin skin test or the immune response to tuberculosis:

A. Interferon-α is an antiviral cytokine that is not directly involved in the tuberculin skin test.

C. Opsonization by complement proteins is a mechanism of antibody-dependent phagocytosis, which is not relevant to the tuberculin skin test.

D. Interleukin-4 is a cytokine involved in the differentiation of T cells into Th2 cells, which is not directly related to the tuberculin skin test.

E. Generation of reactive oxygen species is a mechanism of antimicrobial defense, but it is not directly related to the tuberculin skin test.",Success

"A chronic opioid abuser undergoes emergency surgery. Following the operation, the man is started on a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) thought to be dosed adequately to control his pain in the face of his opioid tolerance. He reports intense pain 6 hours after the conclusion of the surgery. Which agent could have been given intraoperatively to reduce this patient's risk of developing postoperative hyperalgesia?",A,"The correct answer is A. Ketamine.

Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that has been shown to reduce the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, which is a state of increased sensitivity to pain. Opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia are common issues in chronic opioid abusers, and ketamine has been used as an adjunct to reduce these effects. In this scenario, giving ketamine intraoperatively may have reduced the patient's risk of developing postoperative hyperalgesia.",Success
"A 3550-g (7.8-lb) male newborn is delivered at term to a 27-year-old, gravida 1, para 1 woman (Rh+).

Laboratory studies show decreased haptoglobin levels and increased LDH levels. A photomicrograph of a peripheral blood smear is shown. Which of the following is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?",D,"The correct answer is E. Osmotically fragile erythrocytes.

The symptoms described, such as fever, jaundice, and cyanosis, are consistent with hemolytic disease of the newborn. The photomicrograph of the peripheral blood smear likely shows red blood cells with abnormal shapes, such as spherocytes, which are characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis.

Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic disorder that affects the red blood cell membrane, making it osmotically fragile and prone to hemolysis. This leads to anemia, jaundice, and other symptoms seen in this patient.

The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of this patient's condition:

A. Decrease in the reduced form of glutathione is related to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, a different hemolytic disorder.

B. Maternal antibodies against the rhesus D antigen would be involved in hemolytic disease of the newborn due to Rh incompatibility, but the patient's mother is Rh+, making this unlikely.

C. Point mutation in β-globin is related to sickle cell disease, a different hemoglobinopathy.

Approximately 5 days ago she developed an upper respiratory infection managed with bed rest and ibuprofen. Her temperature is 105°F (40.6°C), blood pressure is 95/68 mmHg, pulse is 145/min, and respirations are 23/min. On physical examination, the patient has altered mentation and is agitated and diaphoretic. The patient also has a goiter, exophthalmos, warm skin, and a hand tremor. She is started on intravenous fluids. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Propranolol.

The patient's symptoms, such as confusion, anxiety, sweating, vomiting, and tachycardia, are consistent with thyroid storm, a life-threatening condition that occurs in patients with untreated or undertreated hyperthyroidism. The patient's history of taking methimazole, a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism, and the presence of a goiter and exophthalmos, which are signs of Graves' disease, support this diagnosis.

Propranolol, a beta-blocker, is a key component of the treatment of thyroid storm. It helps to control the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia, tremors, and anxiety, and can also help to reduce the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3).

The other options are not correct because:

A. Antibiotics are not indicated for thyroid storm.

B. Carotid massage is not a treatment for thyroid storm.

C. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that may be used to treat anxiety, but it is not a specific treatment for thyroid storm.

"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because he was vomiting and seemed abnormally sleepy at home. On presentation, he is found to be confused and very lethargic. His parents said that he has had a fever and cough for several days prior to presentation and was given an over the counter medication. Physical exam of this patient reveals mild hepatomegaly and dry mucous membranes. Which of the following effects would the drug most likely also have on the nephron?",B,"The correct answer is B. Constriction of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole.

The patient's symptoms, such as vomiting, lethargy, and hepatomegaly, suggest acetaminophen (Tylenol) overdose, which is a common ingredient in over-the-counter medications. Acetaminophen can cause nephrotoxicity and affect renal function.

In the nephron, acetaminophen can cause vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole, which would decrease renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. However, it would not have a significant effect on the efferent arteriole.",Success

The surgical team decides to use an anesthesia protocol consisting of nitrous oxide, desflurane, and atracurium. Which of the following best describes the role of atracurium in this patient’s anesthesia?",D,"The correct answer is D. It competes with acetylcholine for binding sites in the neuromuscular junction.

Atracurium is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker, which means it works by competing with acetylcholine for binding sites at the neuromuscular junction, thereby reducing muscle contraction and causing muscle relaxation. This is useful in anesthesia to facilitate intubation and surgery.",Success
"A 22-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of swelling in her face, hands, and neck with occasional abdominal pain. The symptoms usually resolve in 2 to 3 days. She has had these swelling events her whole life; however, they have become more debilitating recently. Last week she had an event that restricted her ability to eat and swallow.  Past medical history is noncontributory. Her father is alive and well with no significant medical history. Her mother and her maternal aunt have a similar condition. Today, her physical exam is within normal limits. She brought a picture of her swollen hand as seen in the picture. The treating physician has a strong suspicion of an inherited disorder. C1-inhibitor levels are ordered and found to be extremely low. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?",E,"The correct answer is E. Hereditary angioedema.

The patient's symptoms, including recurrent episodes of swelling in the face, hands, and neck, as well as abdominal pain, are consistent with hereditary angioedema (HAE). The fact that the symptoms resolve on their own in 2-3 days and have been present since childhood also supports this diagnosis. The family history of similar symptoms in the patient's mother and maternal aunt suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which is consistent with HAE.

The low C1-inhibitor levels also support this diagnosis, as HAE is caused by a deficiency of C1-inhibitor, a protein that regulates the complement system.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. DiGeorge syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by abnormalities of the thymus and parathyroid glands, and is not associated with recurrent swelling episodes.

"A 35-year-old Caucasian female presents to the hospital alarmed by her recent truncal weight gain, facial hair growth, and thinning skin. During the physical exam, the physician finds that the patient is hypertensive. Serum analysis reveals hyperglycemia. The physician suspects a pituitary adenoma. Which dexamethasone test result would help confirm the physician's suspicions?",E,"The correct answer is B. Low-dose, increased ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH.

The patient's symptoms, such as truncal weight gain, facial hair growth, and thinning skin, are consistent with Cushing's syndrome, which is caused by excess cortisol production. The physician suspects a pituitary adenoma, which would lead to an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production, stimulating the adrenal glands to produce excess cortisol.

The dexamethasone suppression test is used to diagnose Cushing's syndrome and determine its cause. In this test, a low dose of dexamethasone is administered, and then the ACTH levels are measured. If the patient has a pituitary adenoma, the low dose of dexamethasone will not suppress ACTH production, and ACTH levels will remain elevated.

A high dose of dexamethasone is then administered, and ACTH levels are measured again. If the patient has a pituitary adenoma, the high dose of dexamethasone will suppress ACTH production, and ACTH levels will decrease.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Low-dose, increased ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH.",Success

Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",C,"The correct answer is E. Naloxone.

The patient's symptoms, such as anxiety, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and piloerection, are consistent with opioid withdrawal. The patient's history of chronic back pain and recent move to a new location suggest that he may have been taking opioids for pain management and is now experiencing withdrawal symptoms.

Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can be used to treat opioid withdrawal. It works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord, reversing the effects of opioids and relieving withdrawal symptoms.

Lorazepam (A) is a benzodiazepine that can be used to treat anxiety, but it is not specifically indicated for opioid withdrawal. Naltrexone (B) is an opioid antagonist that can be used to treat opioid dependence, but it is not typically used to treat acute withdrawal symptoms.

He has noticed that it is easier for him to climb the stairs after he has exercised. He has also had a 4.6-kg (10.1-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The pupils are equal and react sluggishly to light. Muscle strength in the proximal lower extremity is initially 3/5 but increases to 5/5 after repeated muscle tapping. His achilles reflex is 1+. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,E,"The correct answer is E. Lambert-Eaton syndrome.

The patient's symptoms, such as cough, difficulty walking, and weight loss, are nonspecific, but the key findings that point to Lambert-Eaton syndrome are:

* Muscle strength that increases after repeated muscle tapping (facilitation), which is a characteristic feature of Lambert-Eaton syndrome.
* Sluggish pupillary reaction to light, which is also consistent with Lambert-Eaton syndrome.
* The patient's history of smoking, which is a risk factor for Lambert-Eaton syndrome.

Lambert-Eaton syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the nerve-muscle connection, causing muscle weakness, fatigue, and autonomic dysfunction. It is often associated with small cell lung cancer, which may be the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

* Polymyalgia rheumatica (A) typically presents with muscle pain and stiffness, rather than weakness.
* Myasthenia gravis (B) typically presents with fluctuating muscle weakness, but not with facilitation of muscle strength after repeated muscle tapping.
* Dermatomyositis (C) typically presents with skin rash and muscle inflammation, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.
* Hypothyroidism (D) typically presents with dry skin, hair loss, and cold intolerance, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.",Success
"A 78-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with weight loss, abdominal pain, and jaundice. CT demonstrates a mass in the head of the pancreas, and biopsy is planned for the following day. The patient's daughter approaches you outside the room to request that the results of the biopsy not be shared with the patient. She asks that the results instead be shared with her and her brother, who is the patient's documented health care proxy. She explains that she and her brother have discussed the situation and decided that it is best to not inform the patient that she has cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy the next morning confirms the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Which of the following is the best response to the patient's daughter's request?",B,"The correct answer is E. Tell the patient's daughter that the patient must be informed of the diagnosis.

As a general rule, patients have the right to know their diagnosis and treatment options, and it is the healthcare provider's duty to inform them truthfully and compassionately. The patient's autonomy and decision-making capacity should be respected, and withholding information from them without their consent is not ethically justifiable.

In this scenario, the patient's daughter and brother may have good intentions, but they do not have the authority to make decisions about what information the patient should or should not receive. The healthcare provider should prioritize the patient's autonomy and inform them of the diagnosis, while also being sensitive to their emotional and psychological needs.

The other options are not the best response:

A. The healthcare provider should not ask the patient's son how to handle the situation, as the patient's autonomy should be respected.

B. Inquiring about the daughter's reasons may be helpful in understanding their concerns, but it does not change the fact that the patient has the right to know their diagnosis.

C. Offering to explain the diagnosis without using the word ""cancer"" may be seen as paternalistic and may not fully respect the patient's autonomy.

D. An ethics consult may be helpful in complex situations, but in this case, the ethical principle of respecting patient autonomy is clear, and an ethics consult is not necessary.",Success
"A 59-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with fatigue. He has been seen in the emergency room 5 times in the past 2 years for acute alcohol intoxication. His past medical history is notable for diabetes mellitus and gout. He takes metformin, glyburide, and allopurinol. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 16/min. He is in no acute distress. A positive fluid wave is noted.

Ferritin: 300 ng/mL
Total iron binding capacity: 200 mcg/dL^3

Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is C. Erythrocytes with a ring of relative pallor.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of sideroblastic anemia, which is a type of anemia characterized by the presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow. Ring sideroblasts are abnormal erythroblasts that have a ring of iron-laden mitochondria around the nucleus.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated iron levels, which is consistent with sideroblastic anemia. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is low, which suggests microcytic anemia. The ferritin level is also elevated, which is consistent with iron overload.

The correct answer, C. Erythrocytes with a ring of relative pallor, describes the characteristic morphology of ring sideroblasts, which are seen in sideroblastic anemia.

The other options are not correct:

A. Erythroblasts with mitochondrial iron deposits are seen in sideroblastic anemia, but this is not the characteristic morphology of the erythrocytes.

B. Erythrocytes lacking central pallor are seen in spherocytosis, not sideroblastic anemia.

D. Hypochromatic erythrocytes are seen in iron deficiency anemia, not sideroblastic anemia.

"A 75-year-old man becomes pulseless in the cardiac intensive care unit 48 hours after admission for ST-elevation myocardial infarction. His blood pressure is 50/20 mm Hg. The ECG monitor shows a tachycardic irregular rhythm with erratic undulations, but no discernible P waves or QRS complexes. During immediate advanced cardiac life support, two attempts at defibrillation are made, after which the patient is given 1 mg of IV epinephrine. After another attempt at defibrillation, the patient remains pulseless and his blood pressure is 60/35 mm Hg. The ECG monitor shows no changes. Administration of which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is C. Epinephrine.

The patient is in cardiac arrest with pulseless ventricular fibrillation (Vfib) or ventricular tachycardia (Vtach), as evidenced by the tachycardic irregular rhythm with erratic undulations on the ECG monitor. The patient has already received two attempts at defibrillation and 1 mg of IV epinephrine, but remains pulseless.

According to the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines for advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), the next step in management would be to administer another dose of epinephrine (1 mg IV). This is because epinephrine is a vasopressor that can help increase blood pressure and improve cardiac output during cardiac arrest.

The other options are not correct because:

* Sotalol (A) is an antiarrhythmic medication that is not indicated for cardiac arrest.
* Amiodarone (B) is an antiarrhythmic medication that may be used for refractory Vfib or Vtach, but it is not the next step in management in this scenario.

In addition, he had an ischemic stroke 9 years ago, from which he recovered completely with physiotherapy and rehabilitation. He has a history of a 56-pack-year cigarette smoking habit. His medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, glimepiride, metformin, metoprolol, and ramipril. The mental status examination is unremarkable. His muscle strength is normal in all 4 limbs. His sensations are decreased on his left side, including his face. The examination of extraocular movements is shown in the image. A lesion in which of the following locations explains the findings during eye examination?",E,"The correct answer is A. Cavernous sinus.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a lesion affecting the left cranial nerve III (oculomotor nerve), which is responsible for controlling eye movements. The image shows that the patient has difficulty moving his left eye laterally, which is consistent with a lesion affecting the left abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI). The cavernous sinus is a location where both the oculomotor and abducens nerves run close together, making it a possible site for a lesion that could affect both nerves and cause the observed symptoms.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and examination findings:

B. Corticospinal tract before pyramidal decussation: This would affect motor function, not eye movements.

C. Dorsal column-medial lemniscus: This is a sensory pathway and would not affect eye movements.

D. Frontal eye field: This is a cortical area involved in eye movements, but a lesion here would not cause the specific pattern of weakness seen in this patient.

She recently retired after working for 28 years as a typist at a data entry firm. Physical examination shows swelling, joint-line tenderness, and decreased range of motion of the first metacarpophalangeal joint and the distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand. Discrete, hard, mildly tender nodules are palpated over the 2nd and 4th distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand. An x-ray of her right hand shows narrowing of the interphalangeal joint spaces with subchondral sclerosis and osteophytes. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Degenerative disease of the joints.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including progressive pain and stiffness of the fingers, swelling, joint-line tenderness, and decreased range of motion, are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA). The presence of discrete, hard, mildly tender nodules over the distal interphalangeal joints, known as Heberden's nodes, is a characteristic feature of OA. The x-ray findings of narrowing of the interphalangeal joint spaces with subchondral sclerosis and osteophytes also support the diagnosis of OA.

OA is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage and bone in joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and limited mobility. It is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide, especially in the hands, knees, hips, and spine.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Monosodium urate crystal precipitation in the joints is characteristic of gout, which typically presents with sudden, severe joint pain and swelling, often in the big toe.

B. Bacterial infection of the joint space is not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, and would likely present with more acute symptoms such as fever, redness, and swelling.

C. Autoimmune-mediated cartilage erosion is characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which typically presents with symmetric joint involvement, morning stiffness, and systemic symptoms such as fatigue and weight loss.

D. Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal precipitation in the joints is characteristic of pseudogout, which typically presents with sudden, severe joint pain and swelling, often in the knees or wrists.",Success
"An 81-year-old man patient recently moved into an assisted living facility and presents today with itchy blisters in his axilla. He attributes these to a poor diet. He also complains that the nurse practitioner at the facility started him on 4 new medications, in addition to his existing prescriptions. On physical examination, tense axillary bullae are noted that do not rupture with light, gloved touch. On direct immunofluorescence, linear C3 and IgG deposits are seen along the basement membrane. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Bullous pemphigoid.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including itchy blisters in the axilla and tense axillary bullae that do not rupture with light touch, are consistent with bullous pemphigoid. The direct immunofluorescence findings of linear C3 and IgG deposits along the basement membrane also support this diagnosis.

Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease that typically affects older adults and is characterized by the formation of tense blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. The disease is often associated with a variety of triggers, including medications, and can be diagnosed with direct immunofluorescence and histopathological examination.

The pain is located diffusely over the right forefoot. Vital signs are within normal range. Examination shows mild swelling over the distal right forefoot. Pressing the metatarsal of the third right toe results in pain. He walks with an antalgic gait. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the right foot shows a slight loss of cortical density and callus formation at the third metatarsal shaft. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is A. Rest and acetaminophen.

The patient's symptoms and x-ray findings are consistent with a stress fracture of the third metatarsal bone, which is a common overuse injury in athletes and military recruits. The management of a stress fracture typically involves rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) to reduce pain and inflammation, as well as modification of activities to avoid further stress on the affected bone. Acetaminophen can be used to manage pain.

Ultrasonography (B) and CT scan (D) are not necessary for the diagnosis of a stress fracture, and a technetium bone scan (C) may be used to confirm the diagnosis, but it is not the next step in management.

The crying infant's lungs are clear to auscultation. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?",D,"The correct answer is D. Passage of a catheter through the nasal cavity not possible.

The symptoms described, such as noisy breathing, bluish discoloration of the lips, and intermittent respiratory distress, are consistent with a diagnosis of choanal atresia, a congenital anomaly where the nasal passages are blocked. The fact that the bluish lip discoloration worsens when the infant feeds and improves when she cries suggests that the infant is having difficulty breathing through her nose.

She is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and the appropriate pharmacotherapy are begun. The drug administered to this patient most likely has which of the following effects on cardiac pacemaker cells during an action potential?",A,"The correct answer is E. decreased K+ efflux during phase 3.

The patient is experiencing anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, and is being treated with epinephrine (adrenaline). Epinephrine is a beta-adrenergic agonist that increases the heart rate and contractility of the heart. In cardiac pacemaker cells, epinephrine increases the heart rate by decreasing the potassium efflux during phase 3 of the action potential, which prolongs the duration of the action potential and increases the frequency of firing.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Increased Ca2+ influx in phase 4: This is not a direct effect of epinephrine on cardiac pacemaker cells.

B. Increased Na+ influx in phase 3: This is not a direct effect of epinephrine on cardiac pacemaker cells.

C. Decreased Ca2+ influx in phase 0: This is not a direct effect of epinephrine on cardiac pacemaker cells.

"A 3-day-old boy is admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for seizures. He was born to a 33-year-old woman at 31 weeks gestation via cesarean section. His birth weight was 1400 grams. Vital signs are significant for systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and hypoventilation. On physical exam, the patient has an altered level of consciousness with decreased spontaneous and elicited movements. The patient is hypotonic on motor testing, has bulging anterior fontanelle, and appears cyanotic. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Cranial ultrasonography.

The patient's symptoms, including seizures, hypotension, bradycardia, and hypoventilation, suggest a possible diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) or intracranial hemorrhage. Cranial ultrasonography is a non-invasive and readily available imaging modality that can quickly assess for intracranial hemorrhage, particularly in a premature infant. It is the best next step in management to rapidly evaluate for potential life-threatening conditions that may require urgent intervention.

While the other options may be useful in the evaluation and management of the patient, they are not the best next step:

A. Complete blood count (CBC) may be useful in evaluating for infection or other systemic disorders, but it is not directly related to the patient's neurological symptoms.

C. Electroencephalography (EEG) may be useful in evaluating for seizure activity, but it is not as urgent as evaluating for potential life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage.

D. Head CT may be useful in evaluating for intracranial hemorrhage, but it requires transportation to the radiology department and may not be as readily available as cranial ultrasonography.

E. MRI of the head may be useful in evaluating for HIE or other structural abnormalities, but it is not as urgent as evaluating for potential life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage and may require sedation and transportation to the radiology department.",Success

The cardiac examination is significant for a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border which is accentuated by forceful expiration against a closed airway. Palpation of the carotid artery shows 2 closely spaced pulses which occur during systole. Which of the following is most consistent with these findings?",D,"The correct answer is B. Aortic stenosis.

The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and syncope, along with the physical examination findings, are consistent with aortic stenosis. The harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border that is accentuated by forceful expiration against a closed airway (Valsalva maneuver) is a classic finding in aortic stenosis. The palpation of the carotid artery showing 2 closely spaced pulses which occur during systole, also known as a ""pulsus parvus et tardus,"" is also consistent with aortic stenosis.

Aortic dissection (A) would typically present with severe chest pain and a murmur of aortic regurgitation, not a systolic ejection murmur. Cardiac tamponade (C) would present with signs of right heart failure, such as jugular venous distension and a paradoxical pulse, which are not mentioned in the question.

Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.3 mU/L
Total T4 160 nmol/L
Free T4 13 pmol/L
Corresponding to the obtained results, how should the patient be managed?",B,"The correct answer is C. Recommend additional anti-TPO test.

The patient's thyroid profile shows a low TSH (0.3 mU/L) and elevated total T4 (160 nmol/L) and free T4 (13 pmol/L) levels, which are consistent with hyperthyroidism. However, the patient is pregnant, and the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy can be challenging.

In this scenario, it is essential to determine the cause of the hyperthyroidism. One possible cause is Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that can cause hyperthyroidism. To confirm this diagnosis, an anti-TPO (thyroid peroxidase) antibody test should be ordered. If the anti-TPO test is positive, it would suggest Graves' disease, and the patient would require further management, including referral to an endocrinologist and possible treatment with antithyroid medications.

Option A is incorrect because levothyroxine is used to treat hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism. Option B is incorrect because the patient's thyroid profile indicates hyperthyroidism, which requires further evaluation and management. Option D is incorrect because methimazole is an antithyroid medication used to treat hyperthyroidism, but it should not be started without a confirmed diagnosis of Graves' disease. Option E is incorrect because assessing T3 levels is not necessary at this point, and the focus should be on determining the cause of the hyperthyroidism.",Success

On examination, he seems embarrassed and avoids making eye contact. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Reassure the mother.

Masturbation is a normal and healthy part of adolescent development, and it is not uncommon for teenagers to engage in this behavior. The boy's behavior is not indicative of any underlying psychological or medical problem. The mother's concern is likely due to a lack of understanding or discomfort with her son's normal sexual development.

His two-dimensional echocardiogram reveals an enlarged left atrium and an ejection fraction of 55%. Which of the following novel drugs is most likely to benefit the patient in addition to valsartan?",D,"The correct answer is D. Sacubitril.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The elevated serum B-type natriuretic peptide and echocardiogram results support this diagnosis.

Sacubitril is a neprilysin inhibitor that is used in combination with valsartan (an angiotensin receptor blocker) to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

* Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (A) is more common in older adults and may be associated with hypertension and kidney disease.
* Membranous nephropathy (B) is often associated with autoimmune disorders and may have a more insidious onset.
* Amyloidosis (D) is a rare condition that typically presents with kidney disease and other systemic manifestations.
* Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (E) is a rare condition that typically presents with hematuria and kidney disease.

Minimal change disease is a diagnosis that is often made based on the clinical presentation and laboratory results, and it may be confirmed with a kidney biopsy.",Success
A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of mild left-sided abdominal pain when lifting heavy objects that has developed over the past 6 months. He has had a weight loss of 41 kgs (90 lbs) in the past year. Physical examination shows a soft bulge inferior and lateral to the navel on the left.

Rectus abdominis.,Success
"A 7-year-old woman presents shortly after her birthday with red scaly plaques over both ears. Her mother reports that the patient recently received a pair of fashionable silver earrings from her older sister as a birthday present. Physical examination is only significant for erythema and tenderness over the lobules of the ears bilaterally. Her vital signs show a blood pressure of 121/73 mm Hg, heart rate of 72/min, and a respiratory rate of 21/min. Her medical history is non-significant. Of the following options, which is the mechanism of this reaction?",D,"The correct answer is D. Type IV–cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction.

The symptoms described, such as red scaly plaques over both ears, erythema, and tenderness, are consistent with an allergic contact dermatitis reaction. This type of reaction is a classic example of a Type IV hypersensitivity reaction, also known as a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. It occurs when T cells in the skin react to an antigen, in this case, the silver in the earrings, leading to an inflammatory response. The reaction typically develops 24-48 hours after exposure to the antigen and can take several days to resolve.",Success
"A 34-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of colicky abdominal pain and diarrhea. He has bowel movements 10–12 times daily; the stool contains blood and mucus. He constantly has the urge to defecate. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the abdomen shows diffuse tenderness to palpation. Serum concentration of C-reactive protein is 20 mg/L (N<10). Colonoscopy shows a bleeding, ulcerated rectal mucosa with several pseudopolyps. Which of the following is this patient at greatest risk of developing?",C,"The correct answer is C. Colorectal cancer.

The patient's symptoms and colonoscopy findings are consistent with ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease. Ulcerative colitis is a known risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer, particularly if the disease is long-standing or severe. The presence of pseudopolyps, which are a characteristic feature of ulcerative colitis, further supports this diagnosis.",Success
"A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of a headache. The last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She also reports having a mild headache for 1 month. There has been a grape-like mass protruding from her vagina for the last 15 days. On examination, the fundus of the uterus is at the level of the umbilicus and no fetal heart sounds are heard. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 160/100 mm Hg, pulse rate 108/min. On USG examination, no fetal parts are seen. What will be the genotype of the substance which will be aspirated by dilation and evacuation?",E,"The correct answer is C. 23XX.

The patient is presenting with a molar pregnancy, which is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease. The symptoms and ultrasound findings are consistent with a complete hydatidiform mole, which is a benign tumor that develops from a fertilized egg that has no embryo.

The genotype of a complete hydatidiform mole is typically 46XX, but since the question asks for the genotype of the substance that will be aspirated by dilation and evacuation, the correct answer is 23XX. This is because the molar tissue is diploid, but it has two sets of maternal chromosomes (23X) and no paternal chromosomes.",Success
"A 42-year-old woman comes to the clinic for a routine annual exam. She recently moved from New Jersey, and her medical records show a total colectomy. The patient reports that she has had annual colonoscopies since she was 10 years of age because her father had “a condition with his colon.” What is the genetic inheritance pattern of the patient’s disease?",A,"The correct answer is A. Autosomal dominant.

The patient's history of annual colonoscopies since age 10 and her father's condition suggest a strong family history of a genetic disorder. The fact that she had a total colectomy also suggests a severe condition. Given the autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, it is likely that the patient has Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), a genetic disorder that increases the risk of colon cancer. FAP is caused by a mutation in the APC gene and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.",Success
"A 2-day-old infant male is brought to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of vomiting and irritability. He was born at home and had unreliable prenatal care because his parents have been experiencing housing instability. About a day after birth, he started to become lethargic and was feeding poorly. His parents thought that he might just be tired so they put him to bed; however, by the next morning he started to vomit and act extremely irritable. On presentation, he is found to have nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelles. Based on this presentation, appropriate cultures are obtained and he is placed on empiric antibiotics. After all cultures grow out the same gram-positive bacteria, the patient is narrowed to penicillin G. Which of the following is a characteristic of the most likely organism that is causing this patient's symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is E. Tumbling motility in broth at 22 degrees.

The patient's symptoms, including vomiting, irritability, nuchal rigidity, and bulging fontanelles, are consistent with meningitis. The fact that the cultures grew gram-positive bacteria and the patient responded to penicillin G suggests that the causative organism is likely Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive bacterium that is known to cause meningitis in newborns, and it is characterized by its tumbling motility in broth at 22°C.",Success
"A 58-year-old man with hypertension and dyslipidemia comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He says he feels well. He is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 103 kg (227 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. His BMI last year was 27 kg/m2. When asked about his diet, he says, “Being overweight runs in my family. Rather than fight it, I just try to enjoy myself and eat what I want.” Which of the following defense mechanisms best describes the patient's response to the physician?",A,"The correct answer is A. Rationalization.

The patient's response, ""Being overweight runs in my family. Rather than fight it, I just try to enjoy myself and eat what I want,"" is an example of rationalization. Rationalization is a defense mechanism in which an individual creates a logical or rational explanation to justify their behavior, in this case, overeating and not making an effort to lose weight. The patient is attributing their weight gain to genetic factors and using that as a reason to indulge in their desires, rather than taking responsibility for their actions.",Success

The patient refuses an examination of his genitals. Which of the following is the best diagnostic test?",D,"The correct answer is D. Viral core antibody.

The patient's symptoms, laboratory values, and urine test results suggest a diagnosis of hepatitis, likely hepatitis B. The patient's risk factors, such as unprotected sex with multiple partners, increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. The viral core antibody test is a diagnostic test for hepatitis B, which would confirm the presence of the virus.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory values:

A. CAGE questions are a screening tool for alcohol use disorder, which is not the primary concern in this case.

B. Direct influenza antigen is a test for influenza, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms or laboratory values.

C. Uretheral swab and culture may be relevant if the patient had symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection, but the patient refused a genital examination, and the laboratory values do not suggest a urinary tract infection.

E. Viral surface antibody is a test for hepatitis B, but it is not as specific as the viral core antibody test, which is a more definitive diagnostic test.",Success
A 63-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion in addition to a 1-month history of ankle swelling. She has a history of sleep apnea. Examination of the lower extremities shows bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema. Cardiac examination shows a widely split S2 that varies with respiration. An ECG shows right bundle branch block. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema?,D,"The correct answer is D. Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema, suggest heart failure. The widely split S2 that varies with respiration and the right bundle branch block on ECG also support this diagnosis. In heart failure, the increased pressure in the right ventricle and atrium leads to increased pressure in the capillaries, causing fluid to leak out into the interstitial space and resulting in edema.",Success
"A 62-year-old man presents with bright red blood in his stool which occurred 2 times this week. He denies fever, weight loss, pain, pruritus or urinary symptoms.

PTH 230 pg/mL
Her complete metabolic panel is otherwise within normal limits. Imaging studies show subperiosteal resorption and osteoporosis. Scintigraphy reveals the most common pathologic condition associated with the patient’s diagnosis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Adenoma.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, a condition in which one or more of the parathyroid glands become overactive and produce excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone (PTH). The elevated PTH level (230 pg/mL) and hypercalcemia (13.8 mg/dL) support this diagnosis.

The imaging studies showing subperiosteal resorption and osteoporosis are also consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism. Scintigraphy is likely to reveal a parathyroid adenoma, which is the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism.

On exam, she is quiet with a flattened affect, but is cooperative and answers questions thoroughly. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Cyclothymic disorder.

Here's why:

* The patient experiences periods of depressed mood that last for 4-6 weeks, which is consistent with cyclothymic disorder.
* She also experiences episodes of elevated mood, which is also consistent with cyclothymic disorder.
* The patient's symptoms do not meet the criteria for a full-blown manic episode, which is required for a diagnosis of bipolar I or II disorder.
* The patient's ability to experience pleasure during her depressive episodes (e.g., enjoying time with her children and husband) is also consistent with cyclothymic disorder.
* The patient's medical history and physical exam findings are not relevant to the diagnosis of a mood disorder.

Cyclothymic disorder is a chronic mood disorder characterized by periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms that are not severe enough to meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.

"A 76-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine examination. She has a history of hypertension well controlled with diet and exercise. She has no history of smoking or illicit drug use. She walks one mile daily. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 119/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. When compared to a healthy 20-year-old woman, which of the following changes in respiratory function is most likely present in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Increased lung compliance.

As people age, their lungs undergo changes that affect respiratory function. One of these changes is an increase in lung compliance, which means that the lungs become more distensible and easier to inflate. This is due to the loss of elastic fibers and the accumulation of senile emphysema, which reduces the lung's ability to recoil and increases its compliance.

The other options are not correct:

B. Vital capacity, which is the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled from the lungs, decreases with age due to the loss of lung tissue and the reduction in diaphragmatic strength.

C. Residual volume, which is the amount of air left in the lungs after exhalation, increases with age due to the loss of lung tissue and the reduction in diaphragmatic strength.

D. Chest wall compliance does not change significantly with age.

E. The alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-a gradient) may increase with age due to the decline in lung function and the reduction in gas exchange, but this is not a direct result of the changes in respiratory function with aging.",Success
"A 32-year-old man jumps off a 3 story building during a suicide attempt. Paramedics arrive quickly, and he is taken to the hospital where several stable lumbar fractures and a shattered right calcaneus are found. He undergoes surgery and his calcaneus is repaired with 11 screws. Which of the following statements best describes the long term post-surgery outcome in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is E. He will have pain while dorsiflexing his foot.

The calcaneus (heel bone) plays a crucial role in weight-bearing and ankle movement. When it is shattered, as in this case, surgical repair often involves the use of screws to stabilize the bone. However, even with successful surgery, the patient may experience long-term complications.

In this scenario, the patient is likely to experience pain while dorsiflexing the foot (lifting the foot upwards) due to the altered anatomy and potential arthritis that can develop in the subtalar joint (the joint between the calcaneus and the talus bone). This is because the calcaneus is involved in the movement of the ankle and subtalar joint, and the surgical repair may not fully restore its normal function.

The other options are not directly related to the calcaneus or its repair:

A. Plantar flexion (pointing the foot downwards) is primarily controlled by the Achilles tendon and gastrocnemius muscle, not the calcaneus.

B. Pointing the toe (extending the toes) is controlled by the muscles in the anterior compartment of the lower leg, not the calcaneus.

C. Foot drop (inability to lift the foot) is typically caused by damage to the common peroneal nerve or the muscles that control ankle dorsiflexion, not the calcaneus.

D. Inversion (turning the foot inward) and eversion (turning the foot outward) are movements controlled by the muscles of the lower leg, not the calcaneus. While the patient may experience some stiffness or limited range of motion, pain with inversion and eversion is not a direct consequence of the calcaneus repair.",Success

An immunological assay is performed and shows positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies. Which of the following changes would you most likely expect to see on intestinal biopsy in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy.

The patient's symptoms, such as episodic diarrhea, malodorous stools, stunted growth, and abdominal cramps, are consistent with celiac disease. The presence of a papulovesicular rash and aphthous ulcers also support this diagnosis. The positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies further confirm the diagnosis.

On intestinal biopsy, celiac disease is characterized by villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy, which is a flattening of the villi and an increase in the size of the crypts. This is due to the immune-mediated damage to the small intestine caused by the ingestion of gluten.",Success

The patient's symptoms, including widespread muscle and joint pain, morning stiffness, fatigue, and tingling sensations in the lower limbs, are consistent with fibromyalgia. The physical examination findings of symmetric muscular tenderness in the neck, shoulders, and lumbosacral area also support this diagnosis.

Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is commonly used to treat fibromyalgia. It can help to relieve pain, improve sleep, and reduce fatigue.

Bupropion (A) is an antidepressant that is not typically used to treat fibromyalgia. Temazepam (B) is a benzodiazepine that may be used to treat insomnia, but it is not a first-line treatment for fibromyalgia. Vitamin B12 (C) deficiency can cause similar symptoms, but the patient's normal mean corpuscular volume and lack of other signs of B12 deficiency make this diagnosis less likely.

Over the last 2 months, he often felt that his face was mildly swollen, especially in the morning hours, but he did not consider it to be anything serious. No significant past medical history. He reports a 20-pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F), pulse is 96/min, blood pressure is 108/78 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical examination, auscultation of the chest reveals rhonchi and crepitus over the right lung. The remainder of the exam is unremarkable. A chest radiograph reveals a mass in the middle lobe of the right lung. Which of the following clinical signs would most likely be present in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is B. Distended veins over lower abdomen.

The patient's symptoms, such as facial swelling, nasal stuffiness, and headaches, suggest superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, which is a compression of the superior vena cava by a tumor or other mass. The chest radiograph reveals a mass in the middle lobe of the right lung, which is likely causing the SVC compression. Distended veins over the lower abdomen would be a common finding in SVC syndrome due to the obstruction of venous return from the upper body.",Success
"A 40-year-old obese man with a history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease presents with one day of excruciating pain, swelling, and redness in his greater toe. He denies any inciting trauma or similar prior episodes. Vital signs are stable. On examination, the right first toe is grossly erythematous and edematous, with range of motion limited due to pain. Deposition of which of the following is associated with the most likely underlying joint disorder?",D,"The correct answer is D. Monosodium urate.

The patient's symptoms, such as excruciating pain, swelling, and redness in the greater toe, are consistent with an acute attack of gout. Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis that occurs when there is a buildup of uric acid in the joints, leading to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals. The patient's history of obesity, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease also increases his risk of developing gout.",Success
"An obese 42-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with a complaint of left knee pain for the past 3 months. She describes the pain as affecting the inside part of the knee as well as the front of her knee, below the kneecap. She denies any inciting injury or trauma to the knee but reports that the pain is worse when she is climbing up stairs or rising from a chair. Physical examination is significant for localized tenderness to palpation over the left anteromedial proximal tibia, 6 cm inferior to the joint line. There is no joint effusion noted. Valgus stress testing is negative for any pain or instability of the knee joint. Radiographs of the left knee are obtained and reveal only mild arthritis, without evidence of any fractures or bony lesions. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Pes anserine bursitis.

The patient's symptoms, including pain on the inside part of the knee and below the kneecap, worsened by climbing stairs or rising from a chair, are consistent with pes anserine bursitis. The physical examination finding of localized tenderness to palpation over the anteromedial proximal tibia, 6 cm inferior to the joint line, also supports this diagnosis. Pes anserine bursitis is a common condition that occurs when the bursa (a fluid-filled sac) located on the medial aspect of the proximal tibia becomes inflamed, often due to repetitive friction or overuse.

The other options are less likely:

A. Stress fracture of proximal tibia: While the patient's symptoms could be consistent with a stress fracture, the radiographs did not reveal any evidence of a fracture.

B. Medial meniscus tear: The patient's symptoms do not suggest a meniscal tear, and the valgus stress testing was negative for any pain or instability of the knee joint.

C. Medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain: The patient's symptoms do not suggest an MCL sprain, and the valgus stress testing was negative.

E. Patellar tendonitis: The patient's symptoms do not suggest patellar tendonitis, which typically causes pain in the front of the knee, directly below the kneecap.",Success
"A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician’s office with concerns about a recent pregnancy. She and her boyfriend had intercourse for the first time a few weeks ago. Two weeks ago she missed her menstrual period. She took several over the counter pregnancy tests that confirmed her pregnancy. She is tearful about the pregnancy and is very concerned. After extensive conversations with her physician and counseling, she decides she wants to medically abort her 6-week pregnancy. Which of the following drugs should be administered to this patient for this purpose?",D,"The correct answer is D. Mifepristone.

Mifepristone, also known as RU-486, is a medication that is commonly used for medical abortion, particularly in the early stages of pregnancy (up to 7 weeks). It works by blocking the action of progesterone, a hormone necessary for pregnancy to continue. This leads to the termination of the pregnancy.

The other options are not correct:

A. Megestrol is a progestin medication, which would actually support pregnancy, not terminate it.

B. Tamoxifen is a medication used to treat breast cancer, not for abortion.

C. Terbutaline is a medication used to treat asthma and other respiratory conditions, not for abortion.

E. Copper intrauterine device (IUD) is a form of contraception, not a medication for abortion.",Success
"A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of periodic painful double vision for 3 days. Her symptoms occur only when looking sideways. She has myopia and has been wearing corrective lenses for 10 years. Ten days ago, she lost her balance and fell off her bike, for which she went to a hospital. A CT scan of the head at that time showed no abnormalities and she was released without further treatment. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Her best corrected visual acuity is 20/40 in each eye. She has an adduction deficit in the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left; she has an adduction deficit in the left eye and nystagmus in the right eye when looking right. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral disc hyperemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?",A,"The correct answer is D. Subdural hematoma extending into the orbit.

The patient's symptoms, including periodic painful double vision, adduction deficits, and nystagmus, suggest a lesion affecting the cranial nerves responsible for eye movement, particularly the third and sixth cranial nerves. The bilateral disc hyperemia on fundoscopy suggests increased intracranial pressure.

Given the patient's history of a recent head injury from a bike fall, a subdural hematoma extending into the orbit is a likely cause of her symptoms. The CT scan 10 days ago may have missed the hematoma, which can develop slowly over time. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a compressive lesion affecting the cranial nerves, which is supported by the presence of bilateral disc hyperemia.

The other options are less likely:

A. Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus would not typically cause painful double vision or bilateral disc hyperemia.

B. A compressive tumor of the pons would likely cause more widespread neurological symptoms and signs.

C. Oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency (Wernicke's encephalopathy) would typically cause more global neurological symptoms, including confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia.

E. Infarction of the brainstem would likely cause more severe and widespread neurological symptoms, including weakness, numbness, and difficulty with speech and swallowing.",Success
"A 63-year-old man presents to the clinic for left calf pain when walking a distance of more than 200 m. He has had this pain for more than 8 months now, and he rates it as 7 out of 10. The pain subsides with rest. The patient has had a history of diabetes mellitus for the past 2 years which is well controlled. A percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 2014. His current medications are insulin and aspirin. Family history is significant for coronary artery disease. He has an 80 pack-year history of smoking and currently smokes. He consumes 4 drinks per day of alcohol. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 144/89 mm Hg, the heart rate is 80/min and regular, the breathing rate is 25/min, and the pulse oximetry is 96%. Normal cardiac and lung sounds were heard on auscultation. Which of the following is the appropriate treatment to improve the patient’s symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Cilostazol.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with intermittent claudication, a classic presentation of peripheral artery disease (PAD). Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that is specifically approved for the treatment of intermittent claudication. It improves walking distance and reduces symptoms in patients with PAD.

Pentoxifylline (Option B) is also used to treat intermittent claudication, but it is less effective than cilostazol.

Femoral embolectomy (Option C) is a surgical procedure to remove a blood clot from the femoral artery, which is not indicated in this patient's case.

Femoral-to-popliteal bypass graft (Option D) is a surgical procedure to bypass a blocked artery in the leg, which may be considered in more severe cases of PAD, but it is not the first-line treatment for intermittent claudication.

Interventional endovascular treatment (Option E) may be considered in patients with more severe PAD, but it is not the most appropriate treatment to improve symptoms in this patient.",Success
"A 72-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of frequent headaches, double vision, fatigue, and myalgias. Physical examination shows pallor, tenderness to palpation over the temples, and inward deviation of the left eye. Laboratory studies show an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 65 mm/h. Temporal artery biopsy shows transmural granulomatous inflammation and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina. Treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids is begun. The patient's condition puts her at greatest risk of developing which of the following complications?",E,"The correct answer is D. Posterior uveitis.

The patient's condition is Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), a type of vasculitis that affects the medium and large arteries, particularly the temporal arteries. The symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with this diagnosis.

GCA can cause various complications, but the one most closely related to this condition is posterior uveitis, which is an inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. This can lead to vision loss if left untreated.

The other options are not directly related to GCA:

A. Pulmonary hypertension is a complication of other conditions, such as heart disease or lung disease.

B. Lower extremity gangrene is a complication of peripheral artery disease, not GCA.

Further evaluation of this patient's vaginal discharge is most likely to show which of the following findings?",E,"The correct answer is E. Flagellated protozoa.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as yellow vaginal discharge, pruritus, and pain with urination, are consistent with trichomoniasis. The foul-smelling, frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge and the pH of 5.8 also support this diagnosis. Trichomoniasis is caused by the flagellated protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis.",Success
"A 15-year-old female presents to her pediatrician’s office for severe menstrual cramping. The patient underwent menarche at age 11, and her periods were irregular every 2-3 months for two years. After that, her cycles became roughly regular every 28-35 days, but she has had extremely painful cramps and often has to miss school. The cramps are intermittent and feel like a dull ache in the center of her abdomen, and there is usually accompanying back pain. The patient has been using heating pads with limited relief. She reports some periods being “really heavy” and requires a superabsorbent pad every 6 hours for 2 days each cycle, but this does not limit her activities. She denies any bowel or bladder changes. The patient had normal development throughout childhood, is on the soccer team at school, and is not sexually active. Her father has hypertension and her mother has endometriosis and heavy periods. On exam, the patient is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 158 pounds (BMI 26.3 kg/m^2). She is well appearing and has no abdominal tenderness. She has Tanner IV breasts and Tanner IV pubic hair, and external genitalia are normal. Which of the following is the best next step for this patient’s menstrual cramps?",D,"The correct answer is D. NSAIDs.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with primary dysmenorrhea, which is menstrual cramping without any underlying pelvic pathology. The patient's history of regular cycles, normal physical exam, and lack of bowel or bladder changes make it unlikely that there is an underlying anatomical abnormality. The patient's family history of endometriosis and heavy periods in her mother may be relevant, but it is not the primary cause of her symptoms at this time.

NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are the first-line treatment for primary dysmenorrhea. They work by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances that cause uterine contractions and cramping. NSAIDs have been shown to be effective in reducing menstrual cramping and are a safe and well-tolerated treatment option.

The other options are not the best next step for this patient's menstrual cramps:

A. Von Willebrand factor antigen assay is not relevant to the patient's symptoms and would not be a useful test at this time.

B. Pelvic ultrasound may be useful in evaluating pelvic anatomy, but it is not necessary in this case given the patient's normal physical exam and lack of symptoms suggestive of an anatomical abnormality.

C. MRI of the pelvis is not necessary and would not be a useful test at this time.

E. Increased exercise may have some benefits for menstrual cramps, but it is not a specific treatment for primary dysmenorrhea and would not be the best next step in this case.",Success

Her pupils are dilated and not reactive to light. She is unresponsive to noxious stimuli. She is intubated, and mechanical ventilation is begun. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference range. Toxicology screening is negative. A CT scan of the head without contrast shows a massive intracranial bleed and a cervical spine injury at the level of C3. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death?",E,"The correct answer is E. Corneal reflex test.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a severe head injury, and the CT scan shows a massive intracranial bleed and a cervical spine injury. Given the patient's unresponsiveness and lack of pupillary reaction to light, brain death is a possibility. The next step in diagnosing brain death would be to perform a clinical examination to assess for the absence of brainstem function.

The corneal reflex test is a key component of the clinical examination for brain death, which assesses the integrity of the trigeminal nerve and the brainstem. The test involves gently touching the cornea with a cotton swab or a small brush to elicit a blink response. If the patient does not blink, it suggests that the brainstem is not functioning.

Electroencephalography (A) may be used to support the diagnosis of brain death, but it is not the next step in the diagnostic process. Magnetic resonance angiography (B) is not necessary for diagnosing brain death. Deep tendon reflex testing (C) is not a component of the brain death examination. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (D) may be used to assess cerebral blood flow, but it is not a standard test for diagnosing brain death.",Success
"A previously healthy 17-year-old female college student comes to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of fever, chills, and severe headache. Her temperature is 39.4°C (103°F).

Which of the following virulence factors was most likely involved in the initial step of this patient's infection?",C,"The correct answer is C. Adhesive pili.

The patient's symptoms and the Gram stain of cerebrospinal fluid showing gram-negative cocci in pairs suggest meningococcal meningitis, caused by Neisseria meningitidis. The initial step of infection involves the adherence of N. meningitidis to the nasopharyngeal mucosa, which is facilitated by adhesive pili.

On physical examination, the patient sits upright. He is lethargic and cyanotic. Lung auscultation reveals widespread bilateral fine rales. Cardiac examination is significant for S3, accentuation of the pulmonic component of S2, and a systolic murmur heard best at the apex of the heart. Soon after hospitalization, the patient develops ventricular fibrillation and dies despite adequate resuscitation measures. Which microscopic finding would you expect to see in this patient on autopsy?",A,"The correct answer is A. Brownish inclusions in the pulmonary macrophages on H&E staining.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest acute heart failure, and the development of ventricular fibrillation and death are consistent with a diagnosis of cardiogenic shock. The presence of pink sputum and bilateral fine rales on lung auscultation suggest pulmonary edema.

The correct answer is A because the patient's history of chronic heart failure and the development of pulmonary edema suggest that the patient may have had hemosiderin-laden macrophages in the lungs, which would appear as brownish inclusions on H&E staining. Hemosiderin is a pigment that forms when hemoglobin is broken down, and it can accumulate in the lungs in cases of chronic heart failure due to repeated episodes of pulmonary edema.",Success

""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

The palpitations are accompanied by chest pain that is sharp and localized to the left 3rd intercostal space. The patient does not smoke. She drinks one to two glasses of wine on the weekends. She appears nervous. Her pulse is 110/min and irregularly irregular, and blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg. Examination shows a fine tremor on both hands and digital swelling. There is retraction of the left upper eyelid. A systolic ejection murmur is heard along the right upper sternal border. The extremities are warm, and pulses are 2+ bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",A,"The correct answer is A. Propranolol.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with hyperthyroidism, specifically Graves' disease. The fine tremor, digital swelling, and retraction of the left upper eyelid are all characteristic features of Graves' disease. The irregularly irregular pulse and systolic ejection murmur are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Propranolol is a beta-blocker that is commonly used to treat the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tremors, anxiety, and palpitations. It can also help to reduce the heart rate and blood pressure.

Digoxin (option B) is a medication used to treat atrial fibrillation, but it is not typically used to treat hyperthyroidism.

He seems to be physically frustrated that no one understands him. Physical examination demonstrates weakness of the right arm. Damage to which location would best explain this patient’s symptoms?,A,"The correct answer is A. Left frontal lobe.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with Broca's aphasia, which is a type of expressive aphasia characterized by difficulty speaking in grammatically correct sentences, often with distorted or nonsensical words. This is typically caused by damage to the left frontal lobe, specifically Broca's area (Brodmann areas 44 and 45).

The other options are not correct because:

* B. Left internal capsule is a region involved in motor control, but it is not typically associated with language processing or aphasia.
* C. Left temporal lobe is involved in receptive language processing, but damage to this area would more likely cause Wernicke's aphasia, characterized by difficulty understanding spoken language.

The neurologic exam shows no focal symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism underlying the patient’s headaches?",E,"The correct answer is A. Meningeal irritation by blood products originating from a chronic subdural hematoma.

The patient's symptoms, such as a bilateral, band-like headache that worsens with coughing or laughing, are consistent with a chronic subdural hematoma. The patient's recent diagnosis of stable angina pectoris and the use of aspirin, which can increase the risk of bleeding, support this diagnosis. The S2 accentuation on physical examination, which is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border, may indicate cardiac decompensation, which can also contribute to the development of a chronic subdural hematoma.

In this patient, infected cells express more MHC class I molecules on their surfaces. This cellular event is primarily induced by a molecule that is also responsible for which of the following changes?",E,"The correct answer is A. Upregulated expression of exogenously synthesized antigens.

The scenario described is consistent with hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. The presence of anti-HAV antibodies and elevated transaminases suggests an immune response to the virus. The expression of more MHC class I molecules on infected cells is induced by interferon (IFN), which is produced in response to viral infection. IFN also upregulates the expression of exogenously synthesized antigens, allowing for more efficient presentation of viral peptides to CD8+ T cells.

The other options are not directly related to the effects of IFN on MHC class I expression:

B. Enhanced macrophage phagocytic function is a result of IFN-γ activation, but it's not directly related to MHC class I expression.

C. Differentiation of T cells into TH1 cells is a result of IL-12 and IFN-γ signaling, but it's not directly related to MHC class I expression.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a diagnosis of hemochromatosis, a genetic disorder characterized by excessive iron absorption and deposition in various organs. The presence of tanned skin, joint pain and stiffness, and liver enlargement are all consistent with this diagnosis.

HLA-B8 is strongly associated with hemochromatosis, and HLA typing is often used to support the diagnosis. The other options are not typically associated with hemochromatosis:

* HLA-B27 is associated with ankylosing spondylitis and other spondyloarthropathies.
* HLA-DR3 is associated with autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes and lupus.
* HLA-DR4 is associated with rheumatoid arthritis.
* HLA-A3 is not specifically associated with any of the above conditions.",Success
"A 32-year-old Caucasian woman is referred to a gastroenterologist by her family physician for 8 months of abdominal pain, foul-smelling diarrhea with floating, bulky stools, weight loss, and macrocytic anemia. Her personal history is relevant for allergic rhinitis. Physical examination shows grouped, erythematous papulovesicular lesions on her arms, torso, and abdomen. Which of the following is the most appropriate approach for the management of this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Gluten-free diet.

The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, foul-smelling diarrhea, weight loss, and macrocytic anemia, are consistent with malabsorption, which is likely due to celiac disease. The presence of a skin rash, described as grouped, erythematous papulovesicular lesions, further supports this diagnosis, as it is a common skin manifestation of celiac disease.

A gluten-free diet is the most appropriate approach for managing celiac disease, as it allows the gut to heal and prevents further damage from gluten exposure. The other options are not directly related to the management of celiac disease:

A. Amitriptyline is an antidepressant medication that may be used to manage abdominal pain, but it is not a specific treatment for celiac disease.

B. Octreotide is a medication used to treat certain gastrointestinal disorders, such as carcinoid syndrome, but it is not typically used to manage celiac disease.

C. A lactose-free diet may be beneficial for individuals with lactose intolerance, but it is not a specific treatment for celiac disease.

E. Methysergide maleate is a medication used to treat migraines and other vascular headaches, but it is not related to the management of celiac disease.",Success
"A 62-year-old woman with small-cell lung cancer comes to the physician because of a painful, burning red rash on her face and hands that developed 30 minutes after going outside to do garden work. She wore a long-sleeved shirt and was exposed to direct sunlight for about 10 minutes. The patient is light-skinned and has a history of occasional sunburns when she does not apply sunscreen. Current medications include demeclocycline for malignancy-associated hyponatremia and amoxicillin for sinusitis. Physical examination shows prominent erythema and a papular eruption on her forehead, cheeks, neck, and the dorsum of both hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is E. Cell injury due to drug metabolites.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with a phototoxic reaction, which is a non-immune-mediated reaction that occurs when a drug or its metabolites accumulate in the skin and react with ultraviolet A (UVA) light, causing cell injury and inflammation. Demeclocycline, an antibiotic, is known to cause phototoxicity, and the patient's symptoms developed after brief exposure to direct sunlight. The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and medication history.",Success
"A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he was found outside in the middle of a blizzard. On presentation, he is conscious but does not know where he is nor how he got there. His wife is contacted and says that he has been getting increasingly confused over the past 6 weeks. This progressed from misplacing objects to getting lost in places that he knew how to navigate previously. Most worryingly, he has recently started forgetting the names of their children. In addition to these memory changes, she says that he now has rapid jerky movements of his extremities as well as coordination and balance problems. Finally, he has become extremely paranoid about government surveillance and has had hallucinations about secret agents in their house. His previous medical history is significant for a previous car crash in which the patient required internal fixation of a femur fracture and a corneal transplant for corneal degeneration. Otherwise he had no neurologic deficits prior to 6 weeks ago. Physical exam reveals myoclonus and ataxia. Which of the following is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",A,"The correct answer is A. Can be transmitted on medical equipment even after autoclaving instruments.

The patient's symptoms, including rapid cognitive decline, myoclonus, ataxia, and hallucinations, are consistent with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a prion disease. Prions are infectious proteins that can cause disease in humans and animals. They are known to be highly resistant to sterilization and can survive on medical equipment even after autoclaving, which is a process that uses high-pressure steam to sterilize instruments. This is why option A is the correct answer.

Option B is incorrect because prions do not contain genetic material. They are infectious proteins that can cause disease, but they do not have a genome.

Option C is incorrect because prions do not have a cell wall containing peptidoglycan. Peptidoglycan is a component of bacterial cell walls, not prions.

Option D is incorrect because CJD is not associated with longstanding hypertension.

Option E is incorrect because CJD is associated with intracellular aggregations of misfolded prion protein, not hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Tau protein is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.",Success
"A 5-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician due to sore throat and fever. He was in his usual state of health until 3 days ago when he began to complain of a sore throat as well as general malaise. The patient's past medical history reveals recurrent upper respiratory infections but no skin or soft tissue infections. The child had cardiac surgery as an infant but has otherwise been healthy. On presentation, his temperature is 100°F (37.8 °C), blood pressure is 115/72 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 22/min. Physical exam shows white plaques on the tongue and mouth. A scraping of this material reveals a characteristic morphology after being treated with KOH. Serum protein electrophoresis shows a normal distribution of bands from this patient. Which of the following findings would most likely be found in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Hypoparathyroidism.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, including the white plaques on the tongue and mouth, suggest a diagnosis of oral candidiasis. The characteristic morphology of the scraping after being treated with KOH is consistent with Candida. The patient's history of recurrent upper respiratory infections and cardiac surgery as an infant, along with the presence of oral candidiasis, suggests a diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome. DiGeorge syndrome is a congenital disorder that can cause abnormalities in the development of the thymus, parathyroid glands, and other organs. Hypoparathyroidism, which is a deficiency of parathyroid hormone, is a common feature of DiGeorge syndrome.",Success
A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for sleeping problems and the inability to concentrate for 3 months. She says she is worried because she and her husband have been trying to conceive for more than a year with no success. Conception by in vitro fertilization was attempted once 3 months ago but was unsuccessful. Analysis of her husband's semen has shown normal sperm counts and morphology. She has a 6-year-old daughter who was born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. She has no history of severe illness and tries to stay healthy by going to the gym an hour per day. Her menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 to 6 days; her last menstrual period started 2 days ago. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's inability to conceive?,C,"The correct answer is B. Asherman's syndrome.

The patient's history of a previous successful pregnancy and regular menstrual cycles make it less likely that she has a hormonal or ovarian problem (options C, D, and E). The fact that her husband's semen analysis is normal also suggests that the issue is with the woman. The patient's symptoms of sleeping problems and inability to concentrate may be related to stress or anxiety, but they are not directly related to the cause of her infertility.

Asherman's syndrome is a condition in which the uterus and/or fallopian tubes are scarred, often as a result of a previous uterine surgery or infection. This scarring can prevent implantation of a fertilized egg and lead to infertility. The fact that the patient had a previous successful pregnancy and has regular menstrual cycles suggests that her ovaries are functioning normally, but the scarring in her uterus may be preventing implantation. This is supported by the fact that in vitro fertilization was unsuccessful, as the embryo may not have been able to implant in the scarred uterus.",Success
"A 25-year-old female is brought to the emergency department by her family. They found her somnolent next to her computer and scattered pill bottles over two hours ago. The family cannot recall the types of pill bottles that they found and did not bring them to the ED. The patient's past medical history is notable for anxiety, obesity, hypertension, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. She is currently not on any medications other than an exercise program with which she is non-compliant. A physical exam is performed and is within normal limits. The patient begins communicating with the physician and states that she did take acetaminophen but it was only a few pills. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse is 82/min, blood pressure is 125/85 mmHg, respirations are 11/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Which of the following is the next best step in management?",A,"The correct answer is B. Blood acetaminophen levels.

The patient has a suspected acetaminophen overdose, and the next step in management is to determine the severity of the overdose by measuring the blood acetaminophen level. This will help guide further treatment, including the administration of N-acetylcysteine (option A), which is an antidote for acetaminophen overdose. However, the blood level should be obtained first to determine the timing and dose of N-acetylcysteine.

Activated charcoal (option C) may be considered if the patient presents within 1-2 hours of ingestion, but it is not the next best step in this scenario. IV fluids (option D) may be used to support the patient's hydration, but it is not a specific treatment for acetaminophen overdose. Syrup of ipecac (option E) is no longer recommended for overdose management due to its potential risks and limited efficacy.",Success
A 27-year-old man and his wife come to the physician for preconception genetic counseling. The patient and his wife are asymptomatic and have no history of serious illness. The patient's older brother died at age 13 from heart failure and his 6-year-old nephew currently has severe muscle weakness. Genetic testing in the patient's family shows that his mother is not a carrier of the mutation that is responsible for the disease in his relatives. A pedigree chart of the patient's family is shown. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the patient not being affected?,C,"The correct answer is E. Incomplete penetrance.

The patient's brother died at age 13 from heart failure, and his 6-year-old nephew has severe muscle weakness, suggesting an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern. The patient's mother is not a carrier of the mutation, which means she did not pass it to the patient. However, the patient's brother and nephew are affected, indicating that the patient's father was likely a carrier of the mutation.

The fact that the patient is asymptomatic despite being at risk of inheriting the mutation suggests that the mutation is not fully penetrant, meaning that not everyone who inherits the mutation will develop the disease. This is the most likely explanation for the patient not being affected.

Variable expressivity (A) refers to the variation in severity of a disease among individuals with the same genotype, but it does not explain why the patient is unaffected.

Maternal uniparental disomy (B) is a rare genetic phenomenon where a person inherits two copies of a chromosome from one parent, but it is not relevant to this scenario.

Gonadal mosaicism (C) refers to the presence of two or more different cell populations in the reproductive cells of an individual, but it does not explain the patient's lack of symptoms.

Dominant negative mutation (D) is a type of mutation that can cause a dominant phenotype, but it is not relevant to this X-linked recessive inheritance pattern.",Success

Serum analysis confirms the physician's suspicions. Which of the following findings was most helpful in the diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. High TSH.

The patient's symptoms, such as weight gain, fatigue, and dry skin, are consistent with hypothyroidism. The diagnosis is confirmed by a high TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level, which indicates that the pituitary gland is producing more TSH in an attempt to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones.",Success

"A 27-year-old male presents for emergency surgery to reattach his left arm, severed during a high-speed car accident, and has lost significant amounts of blood. His wife arrives within minutes to the hospital exclaiming that under no circumstance should he receive any blood transfusions during surgery. After reviewing his medical chart, you see also see an annotation indicating no blood transfusions for religious reasons. Knowing that he needs a blood transfusion to save his life, what do you do?",C,"The correct answer is A. Administer a blood transfusion to save the patient's life.

In this scenario, the patient's life is in imminent danger, and a blood transfusion is necessary to save his life. While the patient's religious beliefs and written instructions are important, they do not take precedence over the need to preserve life. As a healthcare provider, the primary duty is to act in the best interest of the patient, which in this case means administering a blood transfusion.

It's worth noting that the patient's wife's wishes, while important, do not have legal authority to make medical decisions on behalf of the patient. The patient's written instructions, however, may be considered a form of advance directive, but they can be overridden in emergency situations where the patient's life is at risk.

Calling the ethics board (option B) or trying to convince the wife (option D) may be useful in clarifying the situation, but they are not the primary course of action in this emergency situation. Refusing to treat the patient (option E) is not an acceptable option, as it would violate the duty to provide care and potentially lead to the patient's death.",Success
The parents of a 14-year-old patient are concerned and have questions about the use of insulin for their son’s recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes. The patient has developed an upper respiratory infection while at school. He is coughing and has a runny nose. His temperature is 37.8° C (100.2° F) and vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following modifications to his insulin regimen would you recommend to this patient and his parents?,A,"The correct answer is A. Increase the frequency of blood glucose checks.

When a patient with type 1 diabetes develops an illness, such as an upper respiratory infection, it can affect their blood glucose levels. The infection can cause the body to release stress hormones, which can raise blood glucose levels. Additionally, the patient may not be eating normally, which can also impact blood glucose control.

Increasing the frequency of blood glucose checks will allow the patient and their parents to closely monitor blood glucose levels and make adjustments to the insulin regimen as needed. This is especially important during an illness, as blood glucose levels can fluctuate rapidly.

Reducing the insulin dose (option B) or holding insulin (option D) could lead to hyperglycemia, which can worsen the illness and lead to complications. Continuing the same regimen (option C) may not take into account the changes in blood glucose levels caused by the illness. Increasing the insulin dose to double (option E) is not necessary and could lead to hypoglycemia.",Success
"A researcher evaluates healthy breast tissue from 100 women, 50 women that were pregnant at the time of the study and 50 age-matched non-pregnant women. The breast tissue in pregnant women contained an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation compared to the non-pregnant women. Which process caused this change?",A,"The correct answer is A. Hyperplasia.

Hyperplasia is an increase in the number of cells in a tissue or organ, leading to an increase in its size. In this case, the breast tissue in pregnant women showed an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation, which is a classic example of hyperplasia.

Hypertrophy (option B) refers to an increase in the size of cells, not an increase in their number.

Atrophy (option C) refers to a decrease in the size of cells or tissues, which is the opposite of what is described in the question.

Metaplasia (option D) is a process where one type of cell or tissue is replaced by another type, which is not relevant to this question.

Dysplasia (option E) refers to abnormal cell growth or development, which may be a precursor to cancer, but it is not directly related to the increase in the number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation described in the question.",Success
A 21-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. His mother noticed deformities in both of his legs since he started walking independently.

He can kick a ball and say a 2-word phrase. He plays well with other children at his day care. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 40th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows closed anterior and posterior fontanelles. The knees do not stay together when both the feet and ankles are placed together. The gait is unremarkable. The mother is concerned that he has a growth disorder. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?,B,"The correct answer is B. Reassurance and follow-up.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with physiologic genu varum, a common and normal variation in toddlers. The knees not staying together when the feet and ankles are placed together is a classic sign of genu varum. The fact that the gait is unremarkable and the child is able to kick a ball suggests that the deformity is not causing any functional impairment.

Reassurance and follow-up are the most appropriate next steps in management, as physiologic genu varum typically resolves on its own by age 2-3 years. Vitamin D supplementation is not indicated, as there is no evidence of rickets or vitamin D deficiency. X-ray of the lower extremities, bracing, and tibial osteotomy are not necessary at this point, as the deformity is not severe enough to warrant intervention.",Success

The patient is started on tenofovir, abacavir, and efavirenz. However, the patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, so the decision is made to replace this medication with ritonavir. Which of the following adverse effects is this patient at greatest risk for as a result of this change in medication regimen?",B,"The correct answer is A. Hepatotoxicity.

Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, which can increase the levels of other medications metabolized by this enzyme, including efavirenz. This can increase the risk of hepatotoxicity, particularly in patients with pre-existing liver disease or those taking other hepatotoxic medications. The combination of ritonavir and efavirenz can increase the risk of liver enzyme elevations and hepatitis.

Abacavir, on the other hand, is associated with hypersensitivity reactions, which is why it was discontinued in this patient. Tenofovir is associated with nephrotoxicity, but this is not directly related to the change in medication regimen. Lipodystrophy is a side effect of certain antiretroviral medications, but it is not specifically related to the addition of ritonavir.

Urinalysis shows proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells. The patient’s proteinuria best fits in which of the following category?",A,"The correct answer is A. Overflow proteinuria.

The patient's urinalysis shows proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells, which suggests that the proteinuria is not due to glomerular damage or inflammation. The patient's laboratory results also show an elevated calcium level, which is consistent with multiple myeloma. In multiple myeloma, the abnormal proliferation of plasma cells can lead to the production of excessive amounts of immunoglobulins, which can cause proteinuria. This type of proteinuria is known as overflow proteinuria, as the excess immunoglobulins overflow into the urine.

The other options are not correct because:

Which of the following is the next best step in management for this patient's underlying condition?",E,"The correct answer is D. Urine toxicology.

The patient's presentation, including her aggressive behavior, responding to internal stimuli, and oropharyngeal ulcers, suggests a possible diagnosis of phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication. PCP is a dissociative anesthetic that can cause agitation, aggression, and hallucinations. The patient's history of medication non-compliance and depression also raises the possibility of substance abuse.

The lab values show a mild metabolic acidosis, which is consistent with PCP intoxication. The patient's creatinine level is elevated, which may indicate kidney damage.

Given the patient's symptoms and lab values, the next best step in management is to perform a urine toxicology screen to confirm the presence of PCP or other substances. This will help guide further treatment and management.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's underlying condition:

A. IM haloperidol may be used to treat agitation or psychosis, but it is not the next best step in management.

B. Haloperidol depot is a long-acting antipsychotic medication that is not indicated in this scenario.

C. Clozapine is an antipsychotic medication that is not typically used in the acute management of PCP intoxication.

E. ANA and anti-dsDNA levels are not relevant to the patient's presentation and are not the next best step in management.",Success
"A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of fever, abdominal pain, and rapidly progressive distension of the abdomen. His appendix was removed for an abscess 3 days ago. The complete blood count showed leukocytosis. Anaerobic culture of the peritoneal fluid needle aspirate showed a gram-negative pathogen. Which of the following, in addition to polymicrobial infection, is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Bacteroides fragilis.

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, abdominal pain, and rapidly progressive distension of the abdomen, are consistent with peritonitis. The fact that the appendix was removed 3 days ago suggests that the patient may have developed a post-operative peritoneal infection. The anaerobic culture of the peritoneal fluid needle aspirate showing a gram-negative pathogen points towards Bacteroides fragilis, which is a common anaerobic gram-negative bacterium that can cause peritonitis, especially in the setting of a recent abdominal surgery.",Success
"A 31-year-old female patient presents with significant swelling and redness of her fingers that is causing her significant pain. Her right knee has also been stiff and slightly swollen for the past 6 weeks. She is overall fatigued and has difficulty moving around but has not sought medical attention until now. On physical examination, the distal interphalangeal joints are swollen, warm, and painful; her nails are pitted and cracked. There are also rough, erythematous skin patches seen over her elbows which have been present for the last few months. She reports that herer father has a similar condition. They both use hydrating creams and topical glucocorticoids with moderate benefit. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Psoriatic arthritis.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with psoriatic arthritis, which is a type of inflammatory arthritis that occurs in people with psoriasis. The key features that support this diagnosis include:

* Swelling and redness of the fingers, which is consistent with inflammation of the distal interphalangeal joints
* Pitted and cracked nails, which is a common feature of psoriasis
* Rough, erythematous skin patches over the elbows, which is consistent with psoriasis
* Family history of a similar condition, which suggests a genetic component
* Moderate benefit from hydrating creams and topical glucocorticoids, which is consistent with the treatment of psoriasis

Gout (A) is unlikely because it typically affects the big toe and causes sudden, severe pain, whereas the patient's symptoms are more chronic and affect multiple joints. Reactive arthritis (B) is also unlikely because it typically occurs after a gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection, and the patient's symptoms do not suggest a recent infection. Enteropathic arthropathies (D) are a type of arthritis that occurs in people with inflammatory bowel disease, but the patient's symptoms do not suggest gastrointestinal involvement. Dermatomyositis (E) is a muscle disease that causes skin rash and muscle weakness, but it does not typically cause joint inflammation or psoriasis-like skin lesions.",Success
"A 44-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician because she has been having fever, chest pain, and cough for the last several weeks. She presented to the physician because she discovered blood in her sputum after coughing. She recently returned from a year of traveling abroad, but has otherwise been healthy. Based on clinical suspicion, an acid fast stain is performed showing the causative organism, and she is started on appropriate therapy. Two weeks later, she returns with a skin rash, diarrhea, and confusion, and is given a factor to take in addition to the medications previously prescribed. Which of the following is a characteristic of the factor that was most likely provided?",B,"The correct answer is B. Required for dehydrogenase enzymes.

The patient is likely being treated for tuberculosis, given the symptoms and the acid-fast stain result. The medications used to treat tuberculosis, such as isoniazid, can cause a deficiency in vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). Vitamin B6 is required for the functioning of dehydrogenase enzymes, and a deficiency can cause symptoms such as skin rash, diarrhea, and confusion. Therefore, the patient was likely given vitamin B6 as an adjunct to their tuberculosis treatment.",Success
"A 51-year-old Asian woman presents to her primary care provider with abdominal pain. On examination, she is found to have rebound tenderness in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen. Further workup suggests ovarian cancer, which is confirmed later in the week to be stage 4 with confirmed distant metastases in the lungs and brain. Which of the following routes describes the most likely lymphatic route for this malignancy to have metastasized to the brain?",E,"The correct answer is E. Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation.

Here's the explanation:

Ovarian cancer typically metastasizes to the brain through the lymphatic system. The most likely route for ovarian cancer to metastasize to the brain is:

1. Sentinel node (in the pelvis): The cancer cells drain into the sentinel lymph node in the pelvis.
2. Right lumbar trunk: The cancer cells then drain into the right lumbar trunk, which is a lymphatic vessel that carries lymph from the pelvis and lower abdomen.
3. Cisterna chyli: The right lumbar trunk drains into the cisterna chyli, a lymphatic vessel that collects lymph from the lower body.
4. Thoracic duct: The cisterna chyli drains into the thoracic duct, the largest lymphatic vessel in the body, which carries lymph from the lower body to the thoracic region.
5. Left subclavian vein: The thoracic duct drains into the left subclavian vein, which is a major blood vessel that carries blood from the thoracic region to the heart.
6. Systemic circulation: From the left subclavian vein, the cancer cells enter the systemic circulation and can travel to the brain, where they can metastasize.

Option E correctly describes this lymphatic route.",Success

Which of the following would be the best initial management for this patient's condition?",A,"The correct answer is C. Calcium channel blocker (CCB).

The patient's presentation suggests a diagnosis of hypertension with possible hypertensive emergency, given his high blood pressure and symptoms of confusion. The patient's non-compliance with medications for 20 years and lack of other comorbidities make calcium channel blockers a good initial choice for blood pressure control. Calcium channel blockers are effective in reducing blood pressure and are often used as first-line therapy in hypertensive emergencies. They are also relatively safe in elderly patients and can help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications.",Success
"A 4-month-old boy is brought to the pediatrician by his parents. He presents to the pediatric ward with fever, dyspnea, and cough, which he developed 3 days ago.

Sputum culture grows Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A sweat test shows chloride concentration of 85 mEq/L (elevated). Which of the following is involved in the pathogenesis of this patient’s symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Abnormal CFTR protein.

The patient's symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, cough, poor weight gain, and frequent stools with an unpleasant smell, are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). The diagnosis is confirmed by the elevated sweat chloride concentration (85 mEq/L) and the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum culture.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which codes for a protein that regulates chloride and water transport in epithelial cells. The abnormal CFTR protein leads to thick, sticky mucus accumulation in the lungs, digestive tract, and other organs, causing the characteristic symptoms of CF.

The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis:

A. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that can cause lung disease, but it is not related to cystic fibrosis.

C. Eosinophils are not typically involved in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis.

D. Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is an enzyme involved in mitochondrial function, but its deficiency is not related to cystic fibrosis.

E. Mutations in dynein can cause primary ciliary dyskinesia, a rare genetic disorder that affects cilia function, but it is not related to cystic fibrosis.",Success
"A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of worsening grades over the past year. Since she started high school one year ago, her academic performance has decreased. She also has had difficulty finding friends at the new school. She is afraid that her classmates will make fun of her and think that she is “stupid.” One month ago, when she had to give a presentation, she could not stop wondering how her classmates were going to react if she said something wrong. During the presentation, her heart started racing and she became flushed. Since this event, she avoids saying anything in class.

His temperature is 36.6°C (97.9°F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 14/min. On auscultation, a localized harsh pansystolic murmur is heard over the left sternal border at the level of the 2nd–3rd intercostal space. The murmur becomes louder when the patient is asked to squat. An echocardiogram is performed. Which of the structures below gives rise to the defective structure that is causing this patient’s symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is C. Infundibular septum.

The symptoms described, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and a harsh pansystolic murmur over the left sternal border, are consistent with a diagnosis of ventricular septal defect (VSD). The fact that the murmur becomes louder when the patient squats suggests that the VSD is a muscular VSD, which is located in the muscular septum.

The infundibular septum is a structure that develops from the bulbar septum and contributes to the formation of the ventricular septum. A defect in the infundibular septum can result in a VSD.

The other options are not directly related to the development of a VSD:

"A 26-year-old woman developed rapidly progressive septic shock associated with nuchal rigidity, petechiae, and purpura. She tested positive for both Kernig and Brudzinski's signs and shows signs of confusion, dyspnea, and hypotension. The blood culture results confirmed the presence of Neisseria meningitidis, and a complete blood count (CBC) revealed leukocytosis. Which one of the cytokines below takes part in the pathogenesis of septic shock?",A,"The correct answer is A. Tumor necrosis factor-α.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of septic shock. It is released by macrophages and other immune cells in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides, such as those found on the surface of Neisseria meningitidis. TNF-α causes vasodilation, increased permeability, and activation of other immune cells, leading to the characteristic symptoms of septic shock, including hypotension, tachycardia, and organ dysfunction.

The other options are not directly involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock:

* Interleukin-5 (B) is involved in the regulation of eosinophil function and is not typically associated with septic shock.
* Interleukin-12 (C) is involved in the regulation of cell-mediated immunity and is not a key player in septic shock.
* Interferon-α (D) is involved in the regulation of antiviral responses and is not typically associated with septic shock.
* Interleukin-4 (E) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can counteract the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, but it is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock.",Success

Drinking does not cause any difficulty swallowing. He has no coughing or nasal regurgitation. He has no hoarseness or weight loss. He has had heartburn for 2 years with no response to high-dose omeprazole. His past medical history is also significant for asthma and eczema. He takes no medications except for omeprazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormal findings. Which of the following best explains these findings?,C,"The correct answer is C. Eosinophilic esophagitis.

The patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing solid food, but not liquids, and the feeling of food getting stuck in the chest behind the sternum, are consistent with eosinophilic esophagitis. The lack of response to high-dose omeprazole and the presence of asthma and eczema, which are both atopic diseases, also support this diagnosis. Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus, which can cause dysphagia and food impaction.

Achalasia (A) is a motility disorder that typically presents with difficulty swallowing both solids and liquids, and is often accompanied by regurgitation and weight loss.

Diffuse esophageal spasm (B) is a motility disorder that typically presents with chest pain and dysphagia, but not with the specific symptoms described in this case.

Esophageal reflux disease (D) is unlikely given the patient's lack of response to high-dose omeprazole and the absence of other symptoms such as heartburn or regurgitation.

Physical exam is notable for an altered man with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 10. He has minimal muscle tone and is incoherent when answering questions. The patient is covered in sweat and dirt. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Exertional heat stroke.

The patient's symptoms, including altered mental status, high fever (106°F), tachycardia, and sweating, are consistent with heat stroke. The fact that he was working outdoors as a construction worker and was found down at the work site suggests that he was likely exposed to high temperatures and physical exertion, which can cause heat stroke. The patient's past medical history and medications do not seem to be directly related to the current symptoms.

Malignant hyperthermia (B) is a rare condition that occurs as a reaction to certain anesthetics, but it is unlikely in this case since the patient's appendectomy was several months ago.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (C) is a rare but life-threatening side effect of antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol, which the patient is taking. However, it typically presents with muscle rigidity, not minimal muscle tone.

Which of the following options best explains the patient’s neurological and psychiatric symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids.

The patient's symptoms, including tingling and decreased sensation in both lower extremities, somnolence, and forgetfulness, suggest a neurological disorder. The patient's laboratory results show a macrocytic anemia, which is a common feature of vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient's neurological symptoms are consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause demyelination of nerve fibers due to impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids.

Option A is incorrect because the patient's bilirubin levels are not elevated, and chronic bilirubin toxicity is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option B is incorrect because the patient's glucose levels are normal, and chronic hyperglycemia is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

This patient should be started on which of the following medications?",A,"The correct answer is A. Sofosbuvir and simeprevir.

The patient has a positive Hepatitis C IgG and a high HCV RNA level, indicating chronic hepatitis C infection. The treatment of choice for hepatitis C has shifted in recent years to direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), which are more effective and better tolerated than traditional interferon-based regimens.

Sofosbuvir is a DAA that targets the HCV NS5B polymerase, and simeprevir is a DAA that targets the HCV NS3/4A protease. The combination of sofosbuvir and simeprevir is a recommended treatment regimen for genotype 1 hepatitis C, which is the most common genotype in the US.

Interferon-alpha (option B) is an older treatment for hepatitis C that is no longer commonly used due to its side effects and lower efficacy compared to DAAs. Interferon-gamma (option C) is not a treatment for hepatitis C. Ribavirin (option D) is a medication that was often used in combination with interferon-alpha, but it is not typically used as a single agent.

Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody.

The patient's symptoms, such as morning stiffness, erythematous and tender metacarpophalangeal joints, and a family history of fibromyalgia, suggest a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Anti-CCP antibody is a specific autoantibody that is often present in the serum of patients with RA, and its presence can help confirm the diagnosis. It is more specific than rheumatoid factor (option C) and is often used in conjunction with RF to diagnose RA.

Synovial fluid analysis (option A) may be helpful in diagnosing inflammatory arthritis, but it is not specific to RA.

In this case, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest that the amyloid is depositing in the kidneys, leading to nephrotic syndrome.

Option A is unlikely because ibuprofen is not typically associated with nephrotic syndrome. Option B is also unlikely because there is no evidence of heart failure or decreased cardiac ejection fraction. Option D is possible, but serum amyloid A is more commonly associated with reactive amyloidosis, which is typically seen in conditions such as chronic infections or inflammatory disorders. Option E is unlikely because anti-dsDNA immune complexes are more commonly associated with lupus nephritis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman presents with an unsteady and broad-based gait, dysmetria, and intention tremor in the distal upper extremities. Her past medical history is relevant for depression, personality changes, and declining work performance, for which she has been put on leave from her current job as an elementary school teacher. On physical examination, patient has dysarthria, dystonia, and an ataxic gait. Ophthalmologic examination reveals multi-colored irises with concentric rings around the periphery (findings shown in the photo). Sensation and motor functions are preserved. Which of the following would you expect to be abnormally accumulated in this patient’s tissues?",C,"The correct answer is C. Copper.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings (concentric rings around the periphery of the iris), are consistent with Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal copper metabolism. In Wilson's disease, copper accumulates in tissues, particularly in the liver, brain, and eyes, leading to the characteristic Kayser-Fleischer rings.",Success
"A 6-year-old Russian boy who recently immigrated to the United States presents to your office with fever and dyspnea. On examination of the oropharynx, you note a grayish-white pseudomembrane and uneven elevation of the soft palate. The patient displays marked enlargement of the cervical lymph nodes. Which of the following describes the organism responsible for this patient's disease?",B,"The correct answer is B. Gram-positive bacteria producing exotoxin that acts via ADP ribosylation.

The symptoms described, including the grayish-white pseudomembrane on the oropharynx, fever, dyspnea, and enlarged cervical lymph nodes, are consistent with diphtheria. Diphtheria is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a gram-positive bacterium that produces a potent exotoxin that acts by ADP-ribosylating elongation factor 2, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis.",Success
"A 17-year-old male presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient was an unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. He has a past medical history of asthma, depression, and anxiety. He is not currently taking any medications. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. The patient is breathing on his own and has strong distal pulses. Ultimately, the patient is discharged with follow up instructions after no significant fractures or injuries are found. The patient then presents 4 months later to his primary doctor with weakness. The patient's strength in his upper extremities is 1/5. He has reduced sensation in his upper extremities as well. The patient's lower extremities reveal 5/5 strength with intact sensation. A chest radiograph and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is D. Brachial plexopathy.

The patient's symptoms of weakness and reduced sensation in the upper extremities, with normal strength and sensation in the lower extremities, suggest a peripheral nerve injury. The history of a motor vehicle accident 4 months prior, particularly the fact that the patient was an unrestrained driver in a head-on collision, increases the likelihood of a brachial plexopathy. The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that originates in the neck and shoulder region and controls movement and sensation in the arm. Trauma to this area, such as a stretch or compression injury, can cause damage to the nerves and result in weakness and sensory deficits in the arm.

Option A, cervical spine fracture, is unlikely given the patient's normal cardiopulmonary exam and lack of significant fractures or injuries found on initial presentation. Option B, intracranial hemorrhage, is also unlikely given the patient's normal mental status and lack of neurological deficits on initial presentation. Option C, syringomyelia, is a rare condition that affects the spinal cord and is not typically associated with a history of trauma. Option E, conversion disorder, is a psychological disorder that can cause physical symptoms, but it is unlikely to cause the specific pattern of weakness and sensory deficits seen in this patient.",Success
A 62-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the last 15 years. Current medications include glyburide and amlodipine. The physician prescribes a medication that decreases the production of mevalonate. Which of the following changes to the serum is most likely to develop as an adverse effect of the prescribed drug?,A,"The correct answer is A. Increased creatine kinase concentration.

The medication that decreases the production of mevalonate is likely a statin, which is commonly prescribed to lower cholesterol levels. A well-known adverse effect of statins is muscle damage, which can lead to increased creatine kinase (CK) concentrations in the serum. CK is an enzyme that is released from muscle cells when they are damaged. Elevated CK levels can indicate muscle injury or damage.",Success
"A 21-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of excess hair growth on her face. Menses occur irregularly at 45 to 65-day intervals. She is 159 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 23 kg/m2. Physical examination shows facial acne and growth of coarse dark hair on the face, chest, and lower back. Pelvic examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:
Sodium 141 mEq/L
Potassium 4.2 mEq/L
Glucose 109 mg/dL
Cortisol (1600 h) 4 μg/dL
Prolactin 14 ng/mL
17-hydroxyprogesterone 390 ng/dL (N=20–300 ng/dL)
Testosterone 91 ng/dL (N=8–60 ng/dL)
A urine pregnancy test is negative. This patient's condition is most likely associated with which of the following?""",E,"The correct answer is E. Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex.

The patient's symptoms, including excess hair growth on her face, irregular menses, and acne, are consistent with androgen excess. The laboratory results show elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, which is a precursor to cortisol and androgens, and testosterone, which is an androgen hormone. This suggests that the patient has a disorder of adrenal androgen production.

The elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone level is particularly suggestive of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a group of genetic disorders that affect the adrenal glands' ability to produce cortisol and aldosterone. In this case, the patient likely has 21-hydroxylase deficiency, a common form of CAH that leads to excess androgen production.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Hyperproliferation of theca interna cells is associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is a different condition characterized by ovarian cysts and insulin resistance.

B. Exogenous anabolic steroid use would not cause the specific laboratory abnormalities seen in this patient.

C. Compression of the infundibular stalk is associated with hyperprolactinemia, which is not seen in this patient.

D. Ovarian fibrosis and multiple cystic follicles are features of PCOS, which is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.",Success
"A 64-year-old man with coronary artery disease and hypertension comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. His blood pressure ranged from 160/100 mm Hg to 150/94 mm Hg on his previous 3 visits over the past 4 months. Current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol. Three weeks ago, he was also started on amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 158/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. Renal duplex ultrasonography shows 90% occlusion of the right renal artery. Decreased renal blood flow is most likely to cause which of the following?",A,"The correct answer is A. Hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells.

The scenario describes a patient with hypertension and a 90% occlusion of the right renal artery, which would lead to decreased renal blood flow. This would stimulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, causing hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells, which produce renin.",Success
"A 65-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband after he found her with nausea, headache, and agitation 1 hour ago. When he left their lakeside cabin 6 hours before to go ice fishing and get more firewood, she did not have any symptoms. She has chronic migraines, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her medications include lisinopril and metformin, but she ran out of her anti-hypertensive medications over the weekend. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 154/92 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. She is confused and oriented only to person and place. She recalls only one of three objects after 5 minutes. Her gait is unsteady. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's current condition?",C,"The correct answer is D. 100% oxygen therapy.

The patient's symptoms, such as nausea, headache, agitation, confusion, and unsteady gait, are consistent with carbon monoxide poisoning, which is likely due to a faulty heating system or generator in the lakeside cabin. The most effective intervention for carbon monoxide poisoning is 100% oxygen therapy, which helps to displace carbon monoxide from hemoglobin and reduce the half-life of carboxyhemoglobin.",Success
"A 62-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency room with severe substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, and nausea. Imaging reveals transmural myocardial infarction in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. Which of this patient's coronary arteries is most likely occluded?",E,"The correct answer is A. Left circumflex.

The posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum is typically supplied by the posterior descending artery, which is a branch of the right coronary artery (RCA) in 85% of people (right-dominant circulation) and a branch of the left circumflex artery (LCx) in 15% of people (left-dominant circulation). Since the patient is a Caucasian male, it is more likely that he has a right-dominant circulation. However, the question states that the infarction is in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum, which suggests that the left circumflex artery is the culprit vessel.

The left anterior descending (LAD) artery supplies the anterior wall of the left ventricle, not the posterior septum, so option B is incorrect. Diagonal perforators are branches of the LAD and supply the anterior wall, not the posterior septum, so option C is incorrect. Septal perforators are branches of the LAD and RCA and supply the anterior and posterior septum, respectively, but they do not typically cause transmural infarctions, so option D is incorrect. The right main coronary artery supplies the right ventricle and the anterior wall of the left ventricle, not the posterior septum, so option E is incorrect.",Success
"A previously healthy, 24-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of loose, nonbloody stools. He also reports abdominal pain, intermittent nausea, and fever.

Rectal exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 14,800/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 51 mm/h. Test of the stool for occult blood and stool studies for infection are negative. A CT scan of the abdomen shows mural thickening and surrounding fat stranding of discrete regions of the terminal ileum and transverse colon. A colonoscopy is performed and biopsy specimens of the affected areas of the colon are taken. Which of the following findings is most specific for this patient's condition?",C,"The correct answer is C. Formation of noncaseating granulomas.

The patient's symptoms and test results are consistent with Crohn's disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The presence of noncaseating granulomas in the biopsy specimens is a hallmark feature of Crohn's disease and is the most specific finding for this condition.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Neutrophilic inflammation of the crypts is a feature of active colitis, but it is not specific to Crohn's disease and can be seen in other types of colitis, such as ulcerative colitis.

B. Neutrophil-rich pseudomembranes are characteristic of Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) colitis, not Crohn's disease.

He is diagnosed with acute appendicitis and is taken to the operating room for an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy. The appendix is gangrenous and perforated with purulent fluid in the pelvis. Just after the appendiceal base is ligated, the patient shows muscle rigidity and profuse diaphoresis. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 146/70 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. The end-tidal CO2 is 85 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Dantrolene.

The patient is experiencing symptoms of malignant hyperthermia (MH), a rare but life-threatening medical emergency that can occur in response to certain medications, including anesthetics and neuromuscular blockers. The symptoms include muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, tachycardia, and increased end-tidal CO2.

Dantrolene is the specific treatment for malignant hyperthermia. It works by inhibiting the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which helps to reduce muscle contraction and heat production.

Propranolol (A) is a beta blocker that may be used to treat hypertension, but it is not effective in treating malignant hyperthermia.

Bromocriptine (C) is a dopamine agonist that is used to treat Parkinson's disease and hyperprolactinemia, but it is not related to the treatment of malignant hyperthermia.

Cyproheptadine (D) is an antihistamine that is used to treat allergies and itching, but it is not relevant to the treatment of malignant hyperthermia.

"After a T cell progenitor leaves the bone marrow, most of its development takes place in the thymus. It passes through several stages during its maturation. Positive selection is an important process during maturation of T lymphocytes, and it ensures the preservation of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T cells. During which of the following developmental stages does a T cell undergo this process?",C,"The correct answer is C. Double-positive T cell.

Positive selection occurs during the double-positive stage of T cell development, when the T cell expresses both CD4 and CD8 molecules on its surface. At this stage, the T cell undergoes a process of selection, where it is tested for its ability to recognize and respond to self-MHC molecules. T cells that can recognize self-MHC molecules are preserved, while those that cannot are eliminated. This process ensures that mature T cells are self-MHC-restricted, meaning they can recognize and respond to antigens presented by self-MHC molecules.",Success
"A 28-year-old male presents with a recent onset of upsetting dreams, anxiety, and disturbing flashbacks. The patient reports that he returned from active duty in Iraq 3 months ago and was adjusting to life back at home until about 7 weeks ago when he began having intense fear of loud noises and seeing sudden flashbacks to bombing attacks he endured during his time in Iraq. He had to take a leave from his army instructor duties as he was not able to handle the familiar settings of practice shooting ranges and sudden loud explosions during battalion training. After refusing to leave his house, he was finally persuaded by his wife to visit your clinic. What is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Posttraumatic stress disorder.

The patient's symptoms, including upsetting dreams, anxiety, disturbing flashbacks, intense fear of loud noises, and avoidance of triggers that remind him of the traumatic event (in this case, the bombing attacks in Iraq), are all consistent with a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The fact that the symptoms began 7 weeks after his return from active duty and have been persistent enough to interfere with his daily life and relationships also supports this diagnosis.

Acute stress disorder (Option A) is a possibility, but it typically occurs within hours or days of the traumatic event, and the symptoms usually resolve within 2-4 weeks. The patient's symptoms have persisted for 7 weeks, making PTSD a more likely diagnosis.

Performance anxiety (Option B) is not a good fit, as the patient's symptoms are not related to a specific performance or situation, but rather to the traumatic event he experienced.

Schizophrenia (Option C) is not supported by the patient's symptoms, as there is no evidence of hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized thinking.

Panic attack (Option E) is also not a good fit, as the patient's symptoms are not limited to a single episode of intense fear or discomfort, but rather are persistent and related to a specific traumatic event.",Success
"A patient with a1-antitrypsin deficiency is warned by his physician that his increasing dyspnea may be worsened by his continued cigarette smoking. Which of the following factors, released by both neutrophils and alveolar macrophages, is responsible for the patient's condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Elastase.

Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and liver. The deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin, a protease inhibitor, allows elastase, a proteolytic enzyme, to break down elastin, a protein that provides elasticity to the lungs. This leads to the destruction of lung tissue and the development of emphysema.

Neutrophils and alveolar macrophages release elastase, which is responsible for the lung damage in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Cigarette smoking can exacerbate the condition by increasing the release of elastase from these cells.

The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency:

A. Major Basic Protein is a protein released by eosinophils, not neutrophils or alveolar macrophages.

B. Antibodies against alpha-3 segment of collagen IV (COL4A3) are associated with Goodpasture's syndrome, a different disease.

C. Mucus is a thick, protective substance produced by the respiratory tract, but it is not directly related to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

D. Surfactant is a complex of lipids and proteins that helps to reduce the surface tension of alveolar fluid, but it is not involved in the pathogenesis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.",Success

At a follow-up appointment 4 weeks later, the patient reports that his home blood glucose readings have improved. He also mentions that he has had a weight gain of 4 kg (8.8 lb). The patient has most likely been treated with which of the following drugs?",C,"The correct answer is C. Rosiglitazone.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the weight gain of 4 kg (8.8 lb), are consistent with the side effects of thiazolidinediones, such as rosiglitazone. Rosiglitazone is an antidiabetic medication that can take several weeks to have a full effect, which is consistent with the delayed onset of action mentioned in the question.

At the emergency department, she is alert and oriented and is noted to be anorexic. The patient fervently denies being underweight claiming that she is ‘a fatty’ and goes on to refuse any further intravenous fluid and later, even the hospital meals. Which of the following is the best option for long-term management of this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Cognitive-behavioral therapy.

The patient's symptoms and behavior are consistent with anorexia nervosa, a serious eating disorder characterized by a distorted body image and an intense fear of gaining weight. The patient's denial of being underweight, despite being anorexic, and her refusal of food and fluids are classic signs of anorexia nervosa.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that is effective in treating anorexia nervosa. It helps patients identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to their eating disorder. CBT can help the patient develop a more realistic body image, improve their relationship with food, and develop healthier coping mechanisms.

In-patient medical therapy (B) may be necessary in severe cases of anorexia nervosa, but it is not the best long-term management option. In-patient psychiatric therapy (C) may also be necessary in some cases, but CBT is a more specific and effective treatment for anorexia nervosa. Antidepressants (D) may be used to treat co-occurring depression or anxiety, but they are not a primary treatment for anorexia nervosa.

Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 47/mm3 (N ≥ 500). The patient currently refuses to restart antiretroviral therapy. Which of the following medication regimens is most appropriate at this time?,D,"The correct answer is D. Trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin.

The patient has a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (47/mm3) and is not taking antiretroviral therapy, which puts him at risk for opportunistic infections. The most appropriate regimen at this time would be prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), Toxoplasma gondii, and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC).

Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (A) would provide prophylaxis against PCP, but not against Toxoplasma or MAC.

Azithromycin and itraconazole (B) would provide prophylaxis against MAC and fungal infections, but not against PCP or Toxoplasma.

Azithromycin and amphotericin B (C) is not a recommended regimen for prophylaxis against opportunistic infections in HIV patients.

Dapsone, pyrimethamine, itraconazole, azithromycin (E) is an overly broad regimen that includes medications for prophylaxis against PCP, Toxoplasma, and MAC, but also includes dapsone, which is not typically used for prophylaxis in HIV patients.

Transthoracic echocardiography shows multiple vegetations on the tricuspid valve and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Two sets of blood cultures are collected. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Intravenous vancomycin therapy.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest endocarditis, which is a serious infection of the heart valves. The presence of track marks on both cubital fossae and a history of intravenous drug use increase the likelihood of endocarditis. The transthoracic echocardiography showing multiple vegetations on the tricuspid valve and moderate tricuspid regurgitation further supports this diagnosis.

Intravenous vancomycin therapy is the most appropriate next step in management because it is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against many types of bacteria that can cause endocarditis, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin is often used as empiric therapy for endocarditis until blood culture results are available.

Transesophageal echocardiography (A) may be useful in further evaluating the extent of the endocarditis, but it is not the next step in management. A chest X-ray (C) may be useful in evaluating for pulmonary complications, but it is not as urgent as starting antibiotic therapy. A CT pulmonary angiogram (D) is not necessary at this point, and ciprofloxacin (E) is not a suitable empiric antibiotic for endocarditis.",Success

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Iron deficiency.

The peripheral blood smear shows microcytic and hypochromic red blood cells, which are characteristic of iron deficiency anemia. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, pale conjunctivae, and low blood pressure are also consistent with iron deficiency anemia.",Success
"A 40-year old man presents to the clinic with vague upper abdominal pain that has been worsening for the last several days. He says that he often gets similar pain but less severe and that it worsens with meals. The pain sometimes radiates to his back. He recently lost 15 kg (33.6 lb) of weight secondary to his lack of appetite since his last visit 2 months ago. He admits to drinking alcohol almost every night since the age of 17. His temperature is 37.0° C (98.6°F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals moderate epigastric tenderness. An abdominal CT scan reveals calcifications as shown by the white arrows. Which of the following organs is affected in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Pancreas.

The patient's symptoms, such as worsening upper abdominal pain that radiates to the back, weight loss, and lack of appetite, are consistent with chronic pancreatitis. The presence of calcifications on the abdominal CT scan, as indicated by the white arrows, is a characteristic feature of chronic pancreatitis, which affects the pancreas.",Success
"A 36-year-old man presents to his physician for a regular checkup, and he expresses an intent to quit smoking. He is a financial director with a 15-pack-year history of smoking who tried quitting several times. He tried different nicotine replacement products, none of which helped him. The patient has gastrointestinal reflux disease and takes omeprazole. The medical history is significant for a head trauma after which he had two seizure episodes. He does not have a history of any other disorders. Currently, he is not on any antiepileptic medication. He heard from his friend about an antidepressant that efficiently helps with smoking cessation. He would like to try this medication, and asks his physician for an advice. Which of the following statements regarding the use of the mentioned medication is correct?",C,"The correct answer is C. Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and it should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder.

Bupropion is an antidepressant that is sometimes used to help people quit smoking. However, it is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizure disorders, as it can lower the seizure threshold and increase the risk of seizures. Given the patient's history of head trauma and seizure episodes, bupropion is not a suitable option for him.",Success
"A 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 0, at 22 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department for abdominal pain and heavy vaginal bleeding for 2 hours. She has had no prenatal care. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 138/82 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, and regular contractions are felt every 2 minutes. The uterus is consistent in size with a 20-week gestation. There is blood on the vulva, introitus, and medial aspect of the thighs. Ultrasound shows complete detachment of the placenta from the uterus. Fetal heart tones are absent. An emergent cesarean delivery is performed. Following the procedure, the patient becomes tearful and distraught. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial response by the physician?",A,"The correct answer is A. “I'm sorry for your loss. This must be a difficult situation for you.”

"A 78-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressively worsening fatigue and headache for 6 months and occasional abdominal pain. He has not had any changes in his weight. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic shoulder pain. Current daily medications include hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and ibuprofen. He does not drink alcohol and does not smoke. His diet has mostly consisted of potatoes and lean meats since his wife passed away 1 year ago. His pulse is 92/min and blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg. Examination shows conjunctival and mucosal pallor. Abdominal and rectal examination shows no abnormalities. Neurological exam shows mild postural tremor. Peripheral blood smear shows red blood cells with increased zones of central pallor and anisocytosis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is E. Iron deficiency.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, headache, and abdominal pain, along with the physical examination findings of conjunctival and mucosal pallor, suggest anemia. The peripheral blood smear showing red blood cells with increased zones of central pallor and anisocytosis is also consistent with anemia.

The patient's diet, which consists mainly of potatoes and lean meats, is deficient in iron, making iron deficiency anemia a likely cause of his symptoms. The absence of weight loss and the presence of a mild postural tremor also support this diagnosis.

Folic acid deficiency (Option A) is unlikely, as it would not typically cause the symptoms and physical examination findings seen in this patient. Intravascular hemolysis (Option B) would likely cause jaundice and dark urine, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation. Impaired erythropoietin production (Option C) could cause anemia, but it would not typically cause the peripheral blood smear findings seen in this patient. Vitamin B12 deficiency (Option D) can cause anemia, but it would typically cause neurological symptoms such as numbness or tingling in the hands and feet, which are not mentioned in this patient's presentation.",Success

Her younger brother has mild developmental delay, pale complexion, and has to limit his dietary intake of phenylalanine. She has no similar symptoms and is in good health. Her parents are healthy. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother?",A,"The correct answer is A. 67%.

The brother has phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive disorder. The woman is asymptomatic, which means she is not affected by the disease. Since her brother is affected, both parents must be carriers of the disease (otherwise, the brother wouldn't have inherited the mutated genes). As a sibling of an affected individual, the woman has a 2/3 chance of being a carrier, which is approximately 67%.",Success

What is the mechanism of action of the drug which is indicated for the treatment of this patient’s most likely condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Cell wall inhibitor.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of gonococcal arthritis, which is a complication of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. The treatment of choice for gonococcal arthritis is typically a third-generation cephalosporin, such as ceftriaxone, which works by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.",Success
Which of the following patient presentations seen in a pediatric immunology clinic is most consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia?,D,"The correct answer is D. A 9-month-old boy who has had recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia in the past three months.

Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by the absence of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the blood. It typically presents in males between 6-12 months of age with recurrent bacterial infections, particularly otitis media and pneumonia, due to the inability to produce antibodies against encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Option D is the most consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia because it describes a 9-month-old boy with recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia, which is a classic presentation of the disease.

Option A is more consistent with a diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia, which is a different primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by progressive neurologic symptoms, including clumsiness, and recurrent infections.

Option B is more consistent with a diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome, which is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by hypocalcemia, heart defects, and recurrent viral infections.

Option C is more consistent with a diagnosis of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, which is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by recurrent fungal infections, particularly oral candidiasis.

Option E is more consistent with a diagnosis of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections.",Success
"A 29-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by a concerned neighbor. The patient appears disheveled, has a flat affect, and appears to be having auditory hallucinations. He is alert and oriented to time, person, and place and has an intact long-term and short-term memory. His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions. Which of the following is a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Affective symptoms.

The patient's symptoms suggest a psychotic episode, and the presence of affective symptoms (such as grandiosity, agitation, and boastful behavior) is a predictor of good prognosis. Affective symptoms are often seen in patients with bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder, which tend to have a better prognosis than schizophrenia.

The other options are not correct:

B. Slow onset is often associated with a poorer prognosis, as it can indicate a more insidious and chronic course of illness.

C. Being single is not a predictor of good prognosis.

D. Male sex is not a predictor of good prognosis.

A 23-year-old man comes to the clinic for yellowing of his eyes. The patient has been relatively healthy and just recently started “intermittent fasting” to try to lose weight. He recalls a similar episode 4 years ago when he was recovering from an emergency appendectomy. The patient denies smoking but endorses an episode of binge drinking 2 days ago. He is sexually active with both men and women. His physical examination is unremarkable besides scleral icterus. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s symptoms?,C,"The correct answer is C. Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase.

The patient's symptoms, particularly the yellowing of the eyes (scleral icterus), suggest a diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome, a benign condition characterized by mild, intermittent jaundice. The patient's history of a similar episode 4 years ago after an appendectomy and the recent episode after binge drinking are consistent with this diagnosis. Gilbert's syndrome is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, which is involved in the conjugation and excretion of bilirubin. This deficiency leads to increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood, causing jaundice.",Success
A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of vertigo and feeling unsteady while walking.

Pathologic examination of this patient's lesion is most likely to show which of the following?,C,"The correct answer is C. Hypercellular areas of spindle cells and hypocellular areas of myxoid stroma.

The patient's symptoms and MRI findings are consistent with a vestibular schwannoma (also known as an acoustic neuroma), a benign tumor that arises from the Schwann cells of the vestibular nerve. The pathologic examination of this tumor typically shows hypercellular areas of spindle cells and hypocellular areas of myxoid stroma.",Success
A 47-year-old female presents to her primary physician for follow up after an ED visit for nephrolithiasis 1 week prior. CT scan in the ED revealed a 4-mm stone occluding the right ureter. She was able to pass the stone without assistance over the course of 5 hours. Pathology report on the stone states it was composed of calcium oxalate. She says that the pain of passing the stone was excruciating and asks how she can prevent kidney stones in the future. Which of the following interventions is most likely to prevent renal calculi formation in the future for this patient?,B,"The correct answer is B. Decreasing sodium intake.

Calcium oxalate stones are the most common type of kidney stones, and they are often associated with high sodium intake. Reducing sodium intake can help reduce the amount of calcium in the urine, which can in turn reduce the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation.

Decreasing calcium intake (Option A) is not recommended, as adequate calcium intake is important for bone health, and reducing calcium intake may not necessarily reduce the risk of stone formation.

Increasing consumption of nuts and seeds (Option C) may not have a significant impact on stone prevention, as these foods are not specifically known to affect calcium oxalate stone formation.

Loop diuretic pharmacotherapy (Option D) is not typically used for stone prevention, and may even increase the risk of stone formation in some cases.

Urine acidification with cranberry juice (Option E) may be helpful for preventing urinary tract infections, but it is not specifically effective for preventing calcium oxalate stone formation.",Success
"A 62-year-old man comes to the physician because of worsening involuntary movements of both arms for the past 7 months. He reports that certain daily activities have become more difficult to perform. His father had a similar condition that was treated with medications. The patient appears anxious. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a low-amplitude tremor bilaterally when the arms are outstretched that worsens when reaching out to grab a pen. Muscle strength and tone is normal bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. On mental status examination, his mood is good. His speech is normal in rate and rhythm. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",E,"The correct answer is E. Propranolol therapy.

The patient's symptoms, including a low-amplitude tremor that worsens when reaching out to grab a pen, are consistent with essential tremor, a condition that is often inherited and can be treated with beta-blockers such as propranolol. The patient's normal muscle strength and tone, as well as the absence of other neurological signs, support this diagnosis.

Deep brain stimulation (A) and thalamotomy (B) are surgical options that are typically reserved for more severe cases of essential tremor that are refractory to medical therapy. Levodopa and carbidopa therapy (C) is typically used to treat Parkinson's disease, which is a different condition. Clonazepam therapy (D) may be used to treat anxiety or other conditions, but it is not a first-line treatment for essential tremor.",Success

He passed 5 liters of urine on the second postoperative day and serum studies showed a creatinine concentration of 2.1 mg/dL. He has adult polycystic kidney disease and was on maintenance hemodialysis for 2 months prior to transplantation. Current medications include azathioprine, cyclosporine, prednisone, and enalapril. He appears lethargic. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 164/94 mm Hg. Examination shows a healing surgical incision in the right lower abdomen. The graft site shows tenderness to palpation. His blood urea nitrogen concentration is 52 mg/dL, creatinine concentration is 4.1 mg/dL. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows tubulitis. C4d staining is negative. Which of the following is the most likely responsible for this patient's findings?",A,"The correct answer is A. Recipient T-cells in the graft.

The patient's symptoms, such as pain in the right lower abdomen, generalized fatigue, and decreasing urinary output, are consistent with acute rejection of the transplanted kidney. The biopsy result showing tubulitis supports this diagnosis. The absence of C4d staining suggests that the rejection is not antibody-mediated, but rather cell-mediated, which is consistent with the presence of recipient T-cells in the graft.",Success
"A 58-year-old woman presents to the office for routine follow-up. She recently underwent routine screening for bone density due to a history of hypothyroidism. She also has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that is being treated with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) and more recently with a histamine2 receptor antagonist (H2RA), hypertension being treated with a thiazide diuretic, depression being treated with lithium, and hormone replacement therapy. Her results meet the criteria for osteopenia, with a T-score of -1.6. She is concerned about progressive bone loss and the risk of fractures. Which of the following medication classes should be discontinued?",A,"The correct answer is A. Proton-pump inhibitors.

The patient's bone density scan shows osteopenia, which is a concern for progressive bone loss and fracture risk. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are known to increase the risk of osteoporosis and fractures, particularly with long-term use. This is because PPIs can reduce calcium absorption and increase the excretion of calcium in the urine.

Discontinuing the PPI would be a reasonable step to reduce the patient's risk of further bone loss and fractures. The other options are not directly related to bone loss or osteoporosis, and discontinuing them would not address the patient's concern about progressive bone loss.",Success

Vasopressors are administered. One hour later, the patient dies. Which of the following was the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is C. Aortic dissection.

The patient's symptoms and signs, such as:

* Unstable vital signs (hypotension, tachycardia, and irregularly irregular pulse)
* Increased jugular venous pressure
* Bilateral crackles at the lung bases
* Absent P-waves on the electrocardiogram
* Rapid deterioration despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressor administration

are consistent with a diagnosis of aortic dissection. The patient's chest trauma and ecchymoses over the chest also support this diagnosis. The other options are less likely given the patient's presentation:

* A. Cardiac contusion would not typically cause the patient's rapid deterioration and would not explain the absent P-waves on the electrocardiogram.
* B. Hemothorax would not cause the patient's jugular venous distension and would not explain the absent P-waves.
* D. Pulmonary contusion would not cause the patient's rapid deterioration and would not explain the absent P-waves.
* E. Cardiac tamponade would typically cause a more gradual deterioration and would not explain the absent P-waves.

"A 65-year-old man with a longstanding history of poorly-controlled hypertension and no recent illness or cardiac disease presents to clinic complaining of chest pain that is worse on inspiration and relieved by sitting forward. Vital signs are stable. On exam, you detect a friction rub. Routine labs show K 7.5 and Cr 5.1. If this patient's clinical signs and laboratory findings are indicative of a chronic condition, what would be expected on urinary analysis?",E,"The correct answer is E. Broad and waxy casts.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with chronic kidney disease, likely due to hypertension. The presence of a friction rub suggests pericarditis, which can be a complication of uremia. The elevated potassium and creatinine levels also support this diagnosis.

On urinary analysis, broad and waxy casts are typically seen in chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with nephrosclerosis (kidney damage due to hypertension). These casts are formed when the tubular cells and proteins in the urine coalesce and harden, resulting in a characteristic broad and waxy appearance.

The other options are not directly related to chronic kidney disease:

A. Muddy brown granular casts are seen in acute tubular necrosis.

On physical examination, there is elevated jugular venous pressure, decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the lung bases, and 1+ non-pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities. A chest X-ray demonstrates a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the diagnosis of this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Echocardiography.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest heart failure, particularly right-sided heart failure, which is supported by the elevated jugular venous pressure, decreased breath sounds at the lung bases, and bilateral lower extremity edema. The chest X-ray also shows a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette, which further supports this diagnosis. Echocardiography is a non-invasive test that can evaluate cardiac structure and function, and is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing the underlying cause of the patient's heart failure.

Urine microscopy demonstrated abundant square crystals of calcium oxalate that looked like “folded envelopes."" Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen in this patient:",B,"The correct answer is C. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with ethylene glycol poisoning, which is commonly seen in individuals with a history of alcoholism. Ethylene glycol is metabolized to oxalic acid, which can cause the formation of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine, appearing as ""envelope-shaped"" crystals under microscopy.

Ethylene glycol poisoning typically causes a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is characterized by a high anion gap (normal or slightly elevated) and a low serum bicarbonate level. This is due to the accumulation of acidic metabolites, such as oxalic acid, which are not accounted for in the anion gap calculation.

The other options are not directly related to ethylene glycol poisoning:

A. Metabolic alkalosis is not typically seen in ethylene glycol poisoning.

Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.1 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): 65 fL
Total iron binding capacity (TIBC): 550 μg/dL
Serum iron: 45 µg/dL
Serum lead: < 5 µg/dL
What is the best treatment for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Proper diet and iron supplementation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate iron deficiency anemia, which is characterized by a low hemoglobin level (9.1 g/dL), low mean corpuscular volume (65 fL), and low serum iron level (45 µg/dL). The total iron binding capacity (TIBC) is elevated, which is also consistent with iron deficiency.

The patient's history of being breastfed for only 3 months and then switched to cow's milk, which is low in iron, may have contributed to the development of iron deficiency anemia. The introduction of fruits and vegetables two months ago may not have provided sufficient iron to meet the patient's needs.

The best treatment for this patient is to provide iron supplementation in addition to a proper diet that is rich in iron. This will help to increase the patient's iron stores and resolve the anemia. Option A, iron supplementation only, is not sufficient as the patient also needs a proper diet to ensure adequate iron intake.

"A 39-year-old woman, with a history of thyroidectomy and primary hyperparathyroidism presents for surgical evaluation for a right adrenal mass. Preoperatively, which of the following medications should she receive to prevent a hypertensive emergency intraoperatively?",E,"The correct answer is E. Phenoxybenzamine.

The patient has a history of primary hyperparathyroidism and presents with a right adrenal mass, which suggests the possibility of pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal gland that produces excessive amounts of catecholamines, leading to hypertension. Phenoxybenzamine is an alpha-adrenergic blocker that is commonly used to prepare patients with pheochromocytoma for surgery, as it helps to control blood pressure and prevent hypertensive crises intraoperatively.",Success
"A 58-year-old male is diagnosed with hypertension and started on daily propranolol after failing antihypertensive therapy with other medications. Three months later, his blood pressure appears to be adequately controlled on this therapy. While working in his garden one afternoon, the patient is stung by a wasp and experiences a severe anaphylactic reaction that is subsequently treated with epinephrine. Which of the following effects would be expected upon administration of this epinephrine treatment?",C,"The correct answer is A. Decreased bronchodilation.

Propranolol is a non-selective beta blocker, which means it blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. Beta-2 receptors are responsible for bronchodilation, so when epinephrine is administered, its ability to stimulate beta-2 receptors and cause bronchodilation is blocked by propranolol. This can lead to decreased bronchodilation.

The other options are incorrect because:

* B. Propranolol does not affect gastrointestinal motility.
* C. Epinephrine would increase heart rate, not decrease it, but this effect would be blocked by propranolol's beta-1 blockade.
* D. Epinephrine would increase blood pressure, not decrease it, and this effect would not be affected by propranolol.
* E. As mentioned earlier, epinephrine's ability to increase heart rate would be blocked by propranolol's beta-1 blockade.",Success
"An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for short stature. Neither his clothing nor his shoe size have changed over the past year. He also frequently bumps into obstacles such as furniture and has headaches at night. He is always thirsty for cold water and has been urinating more frequently. Three years ago, he had an asthma attack that was treated with albuterol and a one-week course of steroids. His mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis and had precocious puberty. His mother's height is 147 cm (4 ft 10 in) and his father's height is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in). He is at the 5th percentile for height and 5th percentile for weight. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 100/64 mm Hg. Examination shows a soft and nontender abdomen.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?""",C,"The correct answer is C. Craniopharyngioma.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of craniopharyngioma, a type of brain tumor that can cause growth hormone deficiency, leading to short stature. The patient's symptoms include:

* Short stature with no growth over the past year
* Frequent thirst and urination, suggesting diabetes insipidus (DI)
* Headaches at night, which could be related to increased intracranial pressure
* Bumping into obstacles, suggesting possible visual field defects
* Laboratory results showing low insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels, indicating growth hormone deficiency

Craniopharyngioma is a tumor that can compress the pituitary gland and hypothalamus, leading to growth hormone deficiency and DI. The other options are less likely based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

* Rathke cleft cyst (A) is a benign cyst that can cause pituitary hormone deficiencies, but it is less likely to cause DI and visual field defects.
* Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (B) is a condition that causes autoimmune destruction of multiple endocrine glands, but it is less likely to cause a brain tumor and DI.
* Multiple endocrine neoplasia (D) is a condition that causes tumors in multiple endocrine glands, but it is less likely to cause a brain tumor and DI.
* Pituitary adenoma (E) is a type of pituitary tumor that can cause hormone deficiencies, but it is less likely to cause DI and visual field defects.",Success
"A 31-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 32 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department for clear vaginal discharge that started roughly 26 hours ago. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her first child was born at term by vaginal delivery. She has no history of any serious illnesses. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. Current medications include vitamin supplements. Her temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg. Speculum examination demonstrates clear fluid at the cervical os. The fetal heart rate is reactive at 160/min with no decelerations. Tocometry shows uterine contractions. Nitrazine testing is positive. She is started on indomethacin. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is E. Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with induction of labor.

The patient is presenting with symptoms of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), which is confirmed by the presence of clear fluid at the cervical os and a positive nitrazine test. The fetal heart rate is reactive, and there are no signs of fetal distress.

The patient is already receiving indomethacin, which is a tocolytic medication used to slow down uterine contractions. The next step in management would be to administer betamethasone to promote fetal lung maturity, as the patient is at risk of delivering prematurely. Ampicillin is also indicated to prevent group B streptococcal infection.

Induction of labor is the most appropriate next step, as the patient's membranes are already ruptured, and the risk of infection and other complications increases with time. Cesarean section is not indicated at this point, as the patient is not in distress and the fetus is not in distress. Amnioinfusion is not necessary, and testing amniotic fluid for fetal lung maturity is not relevant in this scenario. Progesterone is not indicated for PPROM.",Success
"A 63-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 4-day history of lower abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. He has a history of constipation. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°C). Abdominal examination shows left lower quadrant tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 19,000/mm3. A CT scan of the abdomen shows segmental wall thickening of the descending colon with multiple diverticula and a 5.0-cm, low-attenuation pelvic lesion with air-fluid levels. CT-guided drainage of the fluid collection yields 250 mL of yellow-greenish fluid. Release of which of the following substances is most likely responsible for the formation of the drained lesion?",E,"The correct answer is E. Lysosomal enzymes.

The patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are consistent with diverticulitis, a complication of diverticulosis. The 5.0-cm, low-attenuation pelvic lesion with air-fluid levels is likely an abscess that has formed as a result of the infection. The yellow-greenish fluid drained from the lesion is likely pus, which is a collection of dead white blood cells, bacteria, and cellular debris.

Lysosomal enzymes, such as proteases and lipases, are released by neutrophils and macrophages in response to bacterial infection. These enzymes help to break down bacterial cell walls and other foreign substances, but they can also contribute to tissue damage and the formation of abscesses. In this case, the release of lysosomal enzymes is likely responsible for the formation of the abscess that was drained.

The other options are not directly related to the formation of an abscess in the context of diverticulitis:

A. Staphylococcal coagulase is a bacterial enzyme produced by Staphylococcus aureus, which is not typically associated with diverticulitis.

B. Interferon-gamma is a cytokine involved in the immune response to viral and bacterial infections, but it is not directly related to the formation of abscesses.

C. Lipoteichoic acid is a component of the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria, but it is not directly involved in the formation of abscesses.

D. Interleukin-3 is a cytokine involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis, but it is not directly related to the formation of abscesses.",Success
A researcher is studying risk factors for open-angle glaucoma in a group of elderly patients at a primary care clinic. He is curious if patients with diabetes (defined as fasting serum glucose ≥126 mg/dL on two separate readings) are at increased risk of developing open-angle glaucoma over time. Which of the following is the best statement of the null hypothesis for this study?,A,"The correct answer is A. The future risk of open-angle glaucoma is the same in patients with and those without diabetes.

The null hypothesis is a statement of no difference or no effect, and it is typically the hypothesis that the researcher is trying to disprove.

"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
Given the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?",B,"The correct answer is B. A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.

A type 1 error, also known as a false positive, occurs when a study finds a statistically significant difference between groups when, in reality, there is no true difference. This means that the null hypothesis (which states that there is no difference between groups) is actually true, but the study results suggest otherwise.

In the context of this study, if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error, it would mean that mepolizumab does not actually reduce asthma exacerbations or improve markers of asthma control, but the study results suggest that it does.",Success

What complications is this patient at risk for?",B,"The correct answer is A. Amaurosis fugax.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Takayasu arteritis, a type of vasculitis that affects the aorta and its branches. The absence of a radial pulse at the right wrist and a weak pulse at the left wrist suggest occlusion or stenosis of the subclavian arteries, which is a common feature of Takayasu arteritis.

Amaurosis fugax, which is a transient ischemic attack of the retina, is a complication of Takayasu arteritis due to the involvement of the ophthalmic arteries. The patient is at risk of developing this complication due to the underlying vasculitis.

Myocardial infarction (B) is not a direct complication of Takayasu arteritis, although it can occur due to the involvement of the coronary arteries. Tongue infarction (C) is not a typical complication of Takayasu arteritis. Palpable purpura (D) is a feature of vasculitis, but it is not a specific complication of Takayasu arteritis.

Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a left-sided, tender mass surrounded by edema and erythema in the left inner labia. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Incision and drainage.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a Bartholin's abscess, which is a common condition in women of reproductive age. The abscess is typically caused by an obstruction of the Bartholin's gland duct, leading to infection and abscess formation. The treatment of choice for a Bartholin's abscess is incision and drainage, which involves making a small incision in the abscess to allow the pus to drain out. This can provide immediate relief of symptoms and help to prevent further complications.

Sitz baths (A) may be helpful in managing symptoms and promoting healing after incision and drainage, but they are not a substitute for drainage of the abscess. Cryotherapy (B) is not a treatment for Bartholin's abscess. Biopsy (D) is not necessary in this case, as the diagnosis is clear based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination.

A 21-year-old female presents to the clinic requesting prenatal counseling. She was born with a disease that has led her to have recurrent upper respiratory infections throughout her life requiring antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. She marries a man (without this disease phenotype) from a population where the prevalence of this disease is 1/100. What is the chance that their child will have the disease of interest?,A,"The correct answer is B. 1/10.

The woman has a disease that is likely cystic fibrosis, which is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that she is homozygous for the mutated gene (ff).

Her husband is not affected, so he is likely to be a carrier of the mutated gene (Ff). The probability that he is a carrier is related to the prevalence of the disease in his population, which is 1/100. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the mutated allele (q) can be calculated as:

q = √(1/100) = 0.1

The probability that her husband is a carrier (Ff) is 2pq, where p is the frequency of the normal allele (1 - q). Therefore:

2pq = 2(0.9)(0.1) = 0.18

So, the probability that her husband is a carrier is approximately 18%.

Now, let's calculate the probability that their child will have the disease. Since the woman is homozygous for the mutated gene (ff), she will contribute an f allele to each child. The husband, being a carrier, has a 50% chance of contributing an f allele to each child. Therefore, the probability that their child will have the disease (ff) is:

1/2 × 1 = 1/2

Since the husband is not affected, we only need to consider the probability that he contributes an f allele. Therefore, the probability that their child will have the disease is 1/2 or 1/10 (as a decimal).

So, the correct answer is B. 1/10.",Success

Her upper extremities exhibit fine tremors during an anxiety attack. The laboratory test results reveal elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines. Serum epinephrine, calcitonin, and parathormone levels are also elevated. Hypercalcemia and hyperglycemia are also noted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest the presence of a pheochromocytoma, which is a tumor of the adrenal gland that produces excess catecholamines, leading to hypertension, palpitations, and diaphoresis. The elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines support this diagnosis.

The presence of a diffuse thyroid swelling and elevated calcitonin levels suggest medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), which is a type of thyroid cancer that arises from the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland.

The combination of pheochromocytoma and MTC is consistent with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) 2A, a rare genetic disorder that affects the endocrine system. MEN 2A is characterized by the development of tumors in the thyroid gland (MTC), adrenal glands (pheochromocytoma), and parathyroid glands (hyperparathyroidism).

Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",A,"The correct answer is A. Increased alveolar-arterial gradient.

The patient's symptoms and chest x-ray findings are consistent with pneumoconiosis, likely asbestosis, given his 22-year history of working in a shipyard. The photomicrograph from the sputum sample likely shows asbestos bodies, which are a characteristic finding in asbestosis.

Asbestosis is a restrictive lung disease that can cause an increase in the alveolar-arterial gradient, which is a measure of the difference between the oxygen levels in the alveoli and the arterial blood. This is because the disease causes scarring and stiffening of the lungs, making it harder for oxygen to diffuse into the bloodstream.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:

* B. Bloody pleural effusion is more commonly associated with malignancy or trauma, rather than asbestosis.
* C. Increased total lung capacity is more characteristic of obstructive lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
* D. Concave flow-volume loop is a finding seen in obstructive lung diseases, such as COPD or asthma.

"The parents of a 16-year-old boy with type 1 diabetes mellitus present requesting information about the drug, exenatide, an injectable drug that only needs to be administered once a week. The patient’s blood glucose levels have been difficult to control on his current insulin regimen due to poor adherence to recommended therapy, and he has had difficulty putting on weight despite eating copiously. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. His body mass index (BMI) is 19 kg/m2. Which of the following best describes why the patient should not be switched to exenatide?",A,"The correct answer is A. Insulin production by the pancreas is insufficient for exenatide to be effective.

Exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, which works by stimulating the release of insulin and suppressing the release of glucagon. However, it requires some residual insulin production by the pancreas to be effective. Since the patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus, his pancreas is unable to produce sufficient insulin, making exenatide an inappropriate choice.",Success
"A 79-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a 2-month history of a non-productive cough and fatigue. During this period, she also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss and has become increasingly short of breath with mild exertion. She has congestive heart failure and hypertension. Three months ago, she was in India for 3 weeks to attend a family wedding. She worked as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 47 years. Her current medications include enalapril, digoxin, isosorbide, spironolactone, and metoprolol. She appears thin. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a glucose level of 90 mg/dL, serum lactate dehydrogenase of 227 U/L, and serum protein of 6.3 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows nodular pleural lesions on the right side and a moderate-sized pleural effusion. Thoracentesis shows 250 ml of turbid fluid. Analysis of the pleural fluid aspirate shows:
Erythrocyte count 1/mm3
Leukocyte count 4,000/mm3
Glucose 59 mg/dl
Lactate dehydrogenase 248 U/L
Protein 3.8 g/dL
Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's effusion?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Mesothelioma.

The patient's history of working as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years suggests exposure to asbestos, which is a strong risk factor for mesothelioma. The presence of nodular pleural lesions on the right side and a moderate-sized pleural effusion on the chest x-ray, along with the characteristics of the pleural fluid aspirate (turbid fluid, high protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels), are consistent with a diagnosis of mesothelioma.

While bronchial adenocarcinoma (option A) is a possible cause of pleural effusion, the patient's history and radiographic findings are more consistent with mesothelioma. Nephrotic syndrome (option C) is unlikely given the patient's normal serum protein level. Tuberculosis (option D) is possible, but the patient's recent travel to India and the characteristics of the pleural fluid aspirate make mesothelioma a more likely diagnosis. Congestive heart failure (option E) can cause pleural effusion, but the patient's effusion is more likely related to her occupational exposure to asbestos.",Success
"A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of irregular menstrual bleeding. Menses have occurred at 30- to 90-day intervals since menarche at the age of 12 years. Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago. She is sexually active with her husband and they do not use condoms. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 73 kg (161 lb); BMI is 25.3 kg/m2. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows oily skin and severe acne on the face. There is dark hair on the upper lip and around both nipples. Laboratory studies show:
Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate 6.2 μg/mL (N=0.5–5.4)
Follicle-stimulating hormone 20 mIU/mL
Luteinizing hormone 160 mIU/mL
Testosterone 4.1 nmol/L (N < 3.5)
A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following tests is the most appropriate next step in screening for comorbidities in this patient?""",C,"The correct answer is C. Blood glucose and cholesterol level measurements.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. The irregular menstrual bleeding, oily skin, acne, and excess hair growth are all consistent with PCOS. The laboratory results show elevated levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and testosterone, which are also consistent with PCOS.

PCOS is often associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the next step in screening for comorbidities in this patient would be to measure blood glucose and cholesterol levels to assess her risk for these conditions.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, and are not the most appropriate next step in screening for comorbidities:

A. 17-hydroxyprogesterone and cortisol level measurements would be more relevant in the diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

B. CA-125 level measurement is a tumor marker that is often used to screen for ovarian cancer, but it is not relevant in this patient's case.

D. TSH and T4 level measurements would be more relevant in the diagnosis of thyroid disorders, which are not suggested by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

E. Transvaginal ultrasonography may be useful in evaluating the patient's ovaries and uterus, but it is not the most appropriate next step in screening for comorbidities.",Success

Expired CO2 pressure (PeCO2): 20 mmHg

Which of the following best represents the total volume of gas in this patient's airways and lungs that does not participate in gas exchange?",B,"The correct answer is B. 225 mL.

The question is asking for the volume of gas in the airways and lungs that does not participate in gas exchange, which is also known as the ""anatomical dead space"". This includes the upper airway volume (100 mL) and the conducting airway volume (125 mL). Therefore, the total anatomical dead space is:

100 mL + 125 mL = 225 mL

"A 44-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue, intermittent fever, a 4.0-kg (8.8-lb) weight loss, and a progressive, non-productive cough. She does not smoke. Physical examination shows mild wheezing over bilateral lung fields and enlarged supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes. A CT scan of the chest is shown. A biopsy specimen of a cervical lymph node shows organized epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without focal necrosis. The initial treatment of this patient's condition should include which of the following drugs?",E,"The correct answer is C. Azithromycin.

The patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are consistent with sarcoidosis, a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of granulomas in various organs, including the lungs and lymph nodes. The biopsy specimen showing organized epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without focal necrosis is also consistent with sarcoidosis.

Azithromycin is an antibiotic that is often used to treat sarcoidosis, particularly in patients with mild to moderate disease. It has anti-inflammatory properties and can help reduce the severity of symptoms.

Cisplatin (A) is a chemotherapy drug used to treat cancer, and is not indicated for sarcoidosis. Lamivudine (B) is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV, and is not relevant to this patient's condition. Isoniazid (D) is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis, which is not the diagnosis in this case.

"A 37-year-old woman with an HIV infection comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Six months ago, combined antiretroviral therapy consisting of dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine was initiated. Laboratory studies show a decrease in the CD4 count and an increase in the viral load despite ongoing treatment. The patient is switched to a new treatment regimen, including a drug that acts by preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation. Which of the following is the most likely drug?",B,"The correct answer is D. Raltegravir.

Raltegravir is an integrase inhibitor that prevents viral DNA synthesis by blocking the integration of viral DNA into host cell DNA. It does not require intracellular phosphorylation to be active.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

A. Enfuvirtide is a fusion inhibitor that prevents the virus from entering host cells.

B. Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) that binds to the reverse transcriptase enzyme and prevents it from functioning. It does not prevent viral DNA synthesis.

C. Ritonavir is a protease inhibitor that prevents the virus from replicating by inhibiting the protease enzyme. It does not prevent viral DNA synthesis.

E. Lamivudine is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that is phosphorylated intracellularly to its active form, which then competes with natural nucleosides to inhibit reverse transcription. It does not prevent viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation.",Success
A 14-year-old girl presents with sudden drooping of the right side of her face with drooling and excessive tearing. The patient’s mother says that the patient was recently in northern Maine and spent most of her time during the trip outdoors. Physical examination reveals a slight asymmetry of the facial muscles with an inability to whistle or close the right eye. A circular red rash with central clearing is present on the trunk. There is also decreased taste sensation. Which of the following most likely transmitted the organism responsible for this patient’s illness?,A,"The correct answer is A. Ixodes scapularis.

The patient's symptoms, including facial paralysis (drooping of the right side of her face), drooling, and excessive tearing, are consistent with Lyme disease, which is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. The circular red rash with central clearing (erythema migrans) is a characteristic skin lesion of Lyme disease. The patient's recent outdoor activities in northern Maine, a region where Lyme disease is common, further supports this diagnosis.

Ixodes scapularis, also known as the blacklegged tick, is the primary vector of Borrelia burgdorferi in the northeastern United States, including Maine. The other options are not correct because:

* Tsetse fly (B) is a vector of trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) in Africa.
* Culicidae (C) is a family of mosquitoes that can transmit diseases like malaria, but not Lyme disease.
* Dermacentor variabilis (D) is a tick species that can transmit diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever, but not Lyme disease.

Current medications include simvastatin, metformin, fenofibrate, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, glyburide, and lisinopril. Of these medications, which could contribute to the patient’s transaminitis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Simvastatin.

Simvastatin, a statin, is known to cause transaminitis (elevated liver enzymes) in some patients. While it is generally considered safe, statins can cause liver damage in rare cases.

The other options are not typically associated with transaminitis:

A. Metformin is a diabetes medication that is not typically associated with liver damage.

C. Aspirin is a pain reliever and antiplatelet agent that is not typically associated with liver damage at low doses.

D. Glyburide is a diabetes medication that is not typically associated with liver damage.

E. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor used to treat high blood pressure and is not typically associated with liver damage.

"A 7 -day-old newborn boy presents to the emergency department with a history of fever, irritability, and generalized erythema. During the first 2 days of clinical manifestations, the parents of the child tried to control the symptoms using acetaminophen; however, the newborn continued to be ill, and blisters were noticeable around the buttocks, hands, and feet. During the physical examination, the vital signs include body temperature 39.0°C (102.3°F), heart rate 130/min, and respiratory rate 45/min. Ears, nose, and oral mucosa preserved their integrity, while the skin presents with diffuse blanching erythema and flaccid blisters with a positive Nikolsky’s sign. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Scalded skin syndrome.

The patient's symptoms, including fever, irritability, and generalized erythema, are consistent with scalded skin syndrome. The presence of blisters around the buttocks, hands, and feet, and the positive Nikolsky's sign (where the skin blisters and peels away with gentle pressure) are also characteristic of this condition. Scalded skin syndrome is a rare but serious skin infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus, typically affecting newborns and young children.

The other options are not as likely:

A. Scarlet fever is a bacterial infection that typically causes a characteristic sandpaper-like rash, but it does not typically cause blisters or a positive Nikolsky's sign.

C. Impetigo is a bacterial skin infection that can cause blisters, but it is typically more localized and does not typically cause a positive Nikolsky's sign.

D. Erysipela is a bacterial infection that causes a characteristic red, raised, and sharply demarcated rash, but it does not typically cause blisters or a positive Nikolsky's sign.

"A 60-year-old woman presents to the outpatient clinic complaining of severe vulvar itching that has been gradually worsening for the past year. She mentions that she has tried over-the-counter lubricants, but lubricants do not seem to provide substantial relief. Her medical history is remarkable for diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. Menopause occurred at 52 years of age. She has been sexually active with her husband until recently and reports severe pain during vaginal intercourse. The physical examination reveals dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area with atrophy of the labia minora. The clitoris appears retracted. The perianal skin appears pale and wrinkled. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B,"The correct answer is B. Lichen sclerosus.

The patient's symptoms of severe vulvar itching, dryness, and pain during intercourse, along with the physical examination findings of dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area, atrophy of the labia minora, and a retracted clitoris, are consistent with lichen sclerosus. The pale and wrinkled perianal skin also supports this diagnosis.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects the anogenital area, causing itching, burning, and pain. It is more common in postmenopausal women and can lead to scarring and atrophy of the vulvar tissue.

Squamous cell hyperplasia (A) is a benign condition that can cause vulvar itching and pain, but it does not typically cause the characteristic white plaque-like lesions seen in lichen sclerosus.

Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva (C) is a type of cancer that can cause vulvar itching and pain, but it is typically associated with a mass or ulceration, which is not described in this patient.

Lichen planus (D) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can cause vulvar itching and pain, but it typically causes purple, itchy papules or plaques, rather than the white plaque-like lesions seen in lichen sclerosus.

Atrophic vaginitis (E) is a condition that causes vaginal dryness and itching due to hormonal changes, but it does not typically cause the characteristic vulvar lesions seen in lichen sclerosus.",Success
"A 50-year-old woman with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) presents to your clinic with complaints of left eye pain and reduced vision. She notes that she was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to presentation when she noticed some mild tenderness around her left eye, unrelieved by any pain relievers. This morning when she woke up she was unable to see out of her left eye and made an appointment to come see you. Other than SLE, her medical history is unremarkable. She has had no additional symptoms other than pain and vision loss. Her vital signs are all within normal limits. On exam, she has no vision in her left eye, but 20/30 visual acuity in her right eye. When you shine a light in her left eye there is no response. What response would you expect when you shine a light in her right eye?",B,"The correct answer is A. Bilateral mydriasis.

Since the patient has no light perception in her left eye, the pupils will not constrict in response to light. When you shine a light in her right eye, the normal pupillary light reflex would cause both pupils to dilate (mydriasis) because the nerve pathways that control pupillary constriction are bilateral. Therefore, you would expect bilateral mydriasis when shining a light in her right eye.",Success
"A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain.

Her past medical history is non-contributory and she is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.7°F (37.6°C), blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of abdominal tenderness, a left adnexal mass, and left adnexal tenderness. A transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates free fluid surrounding the ovary with edema and the presence of doppler flow. A urinary pregnancy test is negative. The patient's symptoms persisted after ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Which of the following is the best next step in management?",B,"The correct answer is B. Laparoscopy.

The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, including sudden and severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and a left adnexal mass with tenderness, are consistent with a diagnosis of ovarian torsion. The presence of free fluid surrounding the ovary with edema and Doppler flow on transvaginal ultrasound also supports this diagnosis.

Laparoscopy is the best next step in management because it allows for a minimally invasive surgical exploration of the pelvis to confirm the diagnosis and potentially detorse the ovary. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency that requires prompt intervention to prevent ovarian necrosis and infertility.

A CT scan of the abdomen (Option A) may not provide sufficient information to diagnose ovarian torsion and may delay treatment. Laparotomy (Option C) is a more invasive surgical approach that may be necessary if laparoscopy is not possible or if the patient's condition is unstable. MRI of the pelvis (Option D) may not be necessary in this case, as the ultrasound findings are already suggestive of ovarian torsion. Observation and serial abdominal exams (Option E) are not appropriate, as ovarian torsion requires prompt surgical intervention to prevent complications.",Success

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's bleeding?",E,"The correct answer is E. Arteriovenous malformation in the colonic wall.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations on exertion are consistent with anemia, which is confirmed by the low hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit. The presence of blood in the stools suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, and the patient's history of end-stage renal disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the likelihood of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the colon.

She regained consciousness within half a minute and was alert and fully oriented immediately. She has no history of serious illness. She works as an event manager and has had more stress than usual due to a recent concert tour. She appears well. Her temperature is 37°C (98.4°F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 120/72 mm Hg. Her cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows an incomplete right bundle branch block. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Vasovagal syncope.

The patient's symptoms, such as becoming diaphoretic, pale, and passing out, are consistent with vasovagal syncope. The fact that she regained consciousness within half a minute and was alert and fully oriented immediately also supports this diagnosis. The jerky movements of her arms and legs for a few seconds are likely a convulsive response to the syncopal episode, which is common in vasovagal syncope.

Vasovagal syncope is a common cause of loss of consciousness, especially in young adults, and is often triggered by emotional stress, pain, or other stimuli. The patient's recent stress due to a concert tour and the painful stimulus of getting a tattoo may have contributed to the episode.

The other options are less likely:

B. Orthostatic syncope is unlikely because the patient was seated when she passed out.

C. Tonic-clonic seizure is unlikely because the patient's symptoms and the brief duration of the episode are not consistent with a seizure disorder.

D. Cardiac arrhythmia is unlikely because the ECG shows an incomplete right bundle branch block, which is a benign finding, and there is no other evidence of a cardiac arrhythmia.

E. Cardiac structural abnormality is unlikely because the patient's cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities, and there is no other evidence of a cardiac structural abnormality.",Success

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's shoulder?",C,"The correct answer is C. Apply a simple shoulder sling.

The patient has a fracture of the right clavicle, which is a common injury that can occur from a fall onto the shoulder. The x-ray of the chest shows a displaced fracture of the right clavicle. The patient is in acute distress and has limited range of motion due to pain.

The most appropriate next step in management is to apply a simple shoulder sling to immobilize the shoulder and provide pain relief. This is a non-surgical treatment that can help the fracture heal on its own.

Tension banding (Option A) is not necessary for a clavicle fracture, and a clavicular plate (Option B) is a surgical option that may be considered if the fracture is severely displaced or if there are other complications. An MRI of the right shoulder (Option D) is not necessary at this point, as the x-ray has already confirmed the diagnosis of a clavicle fracture.

A bone marrow biopsy demonstrates 34% myeloblasts with Auer rods that are myeloperoxidase positive. What is best treatment option?",D,"The correct answer is D. Retinoic acid.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The presence of Auer rods in the bone marrow biopsy and the myeloperoxidase positivity are characteristic features of APL.

Retinoic acid, also known as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), is a specific treatment for APL. It induces differentiation of the malignant promyelocytes and promotes their maturation into normal neutrophils. ATRA is typically used in combination with chemotherapy, such as arsenic trioxide, to treat APL.

NPH is a condition in which there is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to ventricular enlargement and increased pressure. The symptoms are often referred to as the ""triad"" of NPH: gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment.

Ventricular shunting is a surgical procedure that involves inserting a shunt to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid from the ventricles and relieve pressure on the brain. This is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms.

The other options are not correct because:

* Acetazolamide therapy (B) is used to treat conditions such as altitude sickness, epilepsy, and glaucoma, but it is not indicated for NPH.
* Temporal lobectomy (C) is a surgical procedure used to treat epilepsy, but it is not relevant to this patient's symptoms.
* Donepezil therapy (D) is used to treat Alzheimer's disease, but it is not indicated for NPH.
* Sertraline therapy (E) is an antidepressant medication, but it is not relevant to this patient's symptoms.",Success
"A 40-year-old woman with Down syndrome comes to the physician for the evaluation of fatigue, progressive clumsiness when using her hands, and difficulty walking for 3 months. During this period, the patient has had several episodes of dizziness as well as double vision. She also reports that she has lost control of her bladder on several occasions lately. She has not had any trauma or weight changes. She lives with her sister and works as a cashier in a local retail store. She takes no medications. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person and place only. There is moderate weakness of the upper and lower extremities. Sensory examination shows no abnormalities. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Babinski's sign is present bilaterally. Which of the following would most likely improve this patient's symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is B. Surgical fusion of C1/C2.

The patient's symptoms, including progressive clumsiness, difficulty walking, dizziness, double vision, and loss of bladder control, are consistent with a diagnosis of atlanto-axial instability, which is a common condition in people with Down syndrome. The presence of Babinski's sign, a reflex indicative of upper motor neuron damage, further supports this diagnosis.

Atlanto-axial instability occurs when the ligaments that hold the atlas (C1) and axis (C2) vertebrae in place are weakened, allowing the vertebrae to shift and compress the spinal cord. This can lead to a range of symptoms, including those experienced by the patient.

Surgical fusion of C1/C2 is a common treatment for atlanto-axial instability, and it would likely improve the patient's symptoms by stabilizing the spine and relieving pressure on the spinal cord.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis:

A. Botulism antitoxin is used to treat botulism, a rare bacterial infection.

C. Methylprednisolone is a steroid medication used to treat a range of conditions, including inflammatory disorders, but it is not specifically indicated for atlanto-axial instability.

D. Donepezil is a medication used to treat Alzheimer's disease, but it is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.

E. Pyridostigmine is a medication used to treat myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disorder, but it is not indicated for atlanto-axial instability.",Success
"A 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus is brought to her primary care doctor by her son who is concerned about the patient's ability to manage her activities of daily living. She has been living alone since her husband passed away 2 years ago. She has remained an active member of her retirement community's wine club; however, she stopped attending the meetings 3 weeks ago. She is generally able to her maintain her house, but her house appears more disorganized over the past 2 weeks. She generally drives short distances but avoids driving long distances as she occasionally gets lost when navigating new areas. She feels like her balance is getting worse, but she has not fallen. She has noticed increased urinary urgency over the past 8 months and has had 2 episodes of incontinence. Despite these changes, she reports feeling well. She drinks 4-6 glasses of wine per day. She was started on multiple medications for worsening anxiety by her psychiatrist 1 month ago. Her BMI is 31 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 99.8°F (37.7°C), blood pressure is 115/65 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 17/min. On examination, she is oriented to person and time but not place or situation. She does not seem to recognize her doctor despite knowing him for many years. She becomes somnolent intermittently throughout the interview. She can recall 0/3 words after 5 minutes. She has a low-frequency tremor in her right arm that increases in severity with deliberate movement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is D. Normal pressure hydrocephalus.

The patient's symptoms, such as urinary incontinence, gait disturbance, and cognitive decline, are consistent with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). NPH is a condition in which there is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to ventricular enlargement, despite normal cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The patient's history of urinary urgency and incontinence, as well as her gait disturbance, are common symptoms of NPH. Additionally, the patient's cognitive decline, including her difficulty with orientation and memory, are also consistent with NPH.

While Alzheimer's disease (Option A) is a possibility, the patient's symptoms are not typical of Alzheimer's, and the rapid decline in her cognitive function over a short period of time is more consistent with NPH.

Delirium (Option B) is a possibility, given the patient's somnolence and fluctuating level of consciousness, but the patient's symptoms are not solely due to delirium, and the underlying cause of her symptoms is more likely to be NPH.

Lewy body dementia (Option C) is a possibility, given the patient's cognitive decline and tremor, but the patient's symptoms are not typical of Lewy body dementia, and the presence of urinary incontinence and gait disturbance are more consistent with NPH.

Pseudodementia (Option E) is not a likely diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms are not solely due to depression or anxiety, and the patient's cognitive decline is not reversible with treatment of her anxiety.",Success
"A 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension presents to his primary care physician for an annual check-up. He reports that he feels well and has no complaints. He takes enalapril and metformin. His temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 155/90 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 16/min. His physician adds another anti-hypertensive medication to the patient’s regimen. One month later, the patient returns to the physician complaining of new onset lower extremity swelling. Which of the following medications was likely prescribed to this patient?",C,"The correct answer is B. Verapamil.

The patient's symptoms of lower extremity swelling are consistent with calcium channel blocker (CCB) induced edema, which is a common side effect of verapamil. Verapamil is a CCB that is often used to treat hypertension, and it can cause peripheral edema due to increased blood flow and permeability in the peripheral vasculature. The other options are less likely to cause edema as a side effect:

A. Metoprolol is a beta blocker that can cause fatigue, dizziness, and bradycardia, but it is not typically associated with edema.

C. Nifedipine is a CCB that can cause edema, but it is more likely to cause ankle edema rather than lower extremity swelling.

D. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that is used to treat hypertension and edema, so it is unlikely to cause edema as a side effect.

E. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can cause hyperkalemia, but it is not typically associated with edema.",Success
"A 29-year-old woman comes to the physician with high-grade fever, headache, and muscle pain. A week ago, she returned from India, where she was working with an NGO to build houses in rural areas. The patient took one dose of chloroquine one week before her trip. She also took a further dose during her trip. She has no history of a serious illness. Her temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 112/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows jaundice. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 10 g/dL and a blood smear shows fragmented erythrocytes and occasional ring-shaped inclusion bodies within erythrocytes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of infection in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Plasmodium falciparum.

The patient's symptoms, such as high-grade fever, headache, and muscle pain, are consistent with malaria. The presence of jaundice and fragmented erythrocytes on the blood smear further support this diagnosis. The ring-shaped inclusion bodies within erythrocytes are also characteristic of Plasmodium falciparum, which is the most severe and deadly form of malaria.

The patient's history of traveling to India, where malaria is endemic, and taking only one or two doses of chloroquine, which is not sufficient for prophylaxis, increases the likelihood of malaria infection.

Dengue virus and Chikungunya virus can cause similar symptoms, but they are not typically associated with jaundice or fragmented erythrocytes on a blood smear. Hepatitis A virus can cause jaundice, but it is not typically associated with fever, headache, and muscle pain, and it does not cause fragmented erythrocytes on a blood smear. Plasmodium ovale is a type of malaria, but it is less severe than Plasmodium falciparum and is not typically associated with jaundice or fragmented erythrocytes on a blood smear.",Success
"A 39-year-old woman presents to the clinic for her annual physical. Although she feels generally healthy she has noticed gaining about 9 kg (20 lb) over the last year. She eats a healthy, varied diet and exercises at the gym 4 days a week, including 20 minutes of aerobic exercise. On further questioning, she has also noted fatigue and constipation. She denies shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, or blood in her stool. At the clinic, the vital signs include: pulse 52/min, blood pressure 110/72 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. The physical exam is notable only for slightly dry skin. The complete blood count (CBC) is within normal limits. Which of the following laboratory values is most likely elevated in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is D. Thyroxine (T4).

The patient's symptoms of weight gain, fatigue, and constipation, along with a normal physical exam and CBC, suggest hypothyroidism. The patient's low pulse rate (52/min) is also consistent with hypothyroidism. In hypothyroidism, the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is typically elevated, but the thyroxine (T4) level is low. Therefore, option D is the most likely elevated laboratory value in this patient.",Success
"A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of persistent diarrhea and fatigue for 1 month. She has had up to 12 watery stools per day. Sometimes she awakens at night because she has to defecate. She has abdominal bloating and cramps. She has had a 2-kg weight loss in the past month. She returned from a trip to Costa Rica 7 weeks ago. She has a history of bronchial asthma and bulimia nervosa. She works as a nurse. She does not smoke and drinks 1–2 beers on the weekend. Current medications include fish oil, a multivitamin, and a salbutamol inhaler. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. Abdominal and rectal examinations are unremarkable. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 46%
Leukocyte Count 6,500/mm3
Platelet Count 220,000/mm3

Abdominal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Colonoscopy shows dark colored mucosa with interspersed white spots. Biopsies of colonic mucosa are obtained and sent for pathological evaluation. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?""",E,"The correct answer is C. VIPoma.

The patient's symptoms, such as persistent diarrhea, fatigue, abdominal bloating, and cramps, are consistent with a VIPoma (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide-secreting tumor). The laboratory results, including hypokalemia (low potassium levels) and a normal anion gap, also support this diagnosis. The colonoscopy findings of dark-colored mucosa with interspersed white spots are also characteristic of VIPoma.

VIPoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that secretes excessive amounts of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), leading to a syndrome of watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria (lack of stomach acid). The patient's history of bulimia nervosa and her occupation as a nurse may have contributed to her delayed presentation and diagnosis.

The other options are less likely:

A. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes malabsorption, but it does not typically cause hypokalemia or the characteristic colonoscopy findings seen in this patient.

B. Carcinoid tumor is a type of neuroendocrine tumor, but it typically causes flushing, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, rather than the specific symptoms seen in this patient.

D. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that can cause abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits, but it does not typically cause hypokalemia or the characteristic colonoscopy findings seen in this patient.

E. Medication abuse is unlikely, given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, and there is no evidence to suggest that she is abusing medications.",Success
"A 21-year-old college student comes to the physician because of daytime fatigue for 2 months. He has problems getting to sleep at night and frequently falls asleep during class. Recently he has started skipping classes altogether. He goes to bed between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. but cannot fall asleep for 2–3 hours. When he wakes up at 8:30 a.m., he feels extremely drowsy, and he tries to overcome his fatigue by drinking 2–3 cups of coffee a day. He naps at various times during the afternoon, often for more than an hour. He stopped watching videos on his smartphone at night because of suggestions from his peers. He states that he has tried over-the-counter melatonin pills and exercising at 8 p.m. without success. He has no history of serious illness. He does not smoke. He drinks three to five beers on weekends. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient?",C,"The correct answer is B. Complete caffeine cessation.

The patient is experiencing daytime fatigue, difficulty falling asleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness, which are all symptoms of insomnia. The patient's caffeine consumption (2-3 cups of coffee per day) is likely contributing to his insomnia, as caffeine can interfere with sleep quality and duration. Stopping caffeine consumption altogether may help improve the patient's sleep quality and reduce his daytime fatigue.

The other options are not as appropriate:

A. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that can cause drowsiness, but it is not a recommended treatment for insomnia and can have negative side effects.

C. Exercise in the evening can actually help improve sleep quality, so stopping evening exercise is not likely to be beneficial.

D. Consuming an alcoholic beverage before bedtime can disrupt sleep patterns and reduce sleep quality, so this is not a recommended strategy.

E. While napping can be helpful for some people, the patient's long naps (often over an hour) may be contributing to his insomnia and daytime fatigue. Scheduled afternoon naps may not be the best approach in this case.",Success
"A 19-year-old man is brought to the physician by his mother because she is worried about his strange behavior. Over the past 3 years, he has been dressing all in black and wears a long black coat, even in the summer. The mother reports that her son has always had difficulties fitting in. He does not have any friends and spends most of his time in his room playing online games. He is anxious at college because he is uncomfortable around other people, and his academic performance is poor. Rather than doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons. He says that he has never seen any demons, but sometimes there are signs of their presence. For example, a breeze in an enclosed room is likely the “breath of a demon”. Mental status examination shows laborious speech. The patient avoids eye contact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Schizotypal personality disorder.

The patient's behavior and symptoms are consistent with schizotypal personality disorder, which is a personality disorder characterized by eccentric behavior, odd speech, and magical thinking. The patient's dressing style, interest in paranormal phenomena, and interpretation of natural events as signs of demonic presence are all indicative of eccentric behavior. His laborious speech and avoidance of eye contact are also consistent with this diagnosis.

While social anxiety disorder (A) may be present, it is not the primary diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms go beyond social anxiety. Avoidant personality disorder (B) is also possible, but the patient's eccentric behavior and magical thinking are more consistent with schizotypal personality disorder. Paranoid personality disorder (D) is not supported by the patient's symptoms, as he does not exhibit suspiciousness or mistrust of others. Schizophrenia (E) is also unlikely, as the patient does not exhibit hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized thinking.",Success
