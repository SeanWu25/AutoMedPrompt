Narrowing of the left main coronary artery\nC. Bicuspid aortic valve\nD. Ventricular septum defect\nE. Symmetric thickening of the left ventricle\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 23-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of increasing abdominal pain with associated nausea and vomiting. The symptoms began suddenly after having intercourse with her partner six hours ago. There is no associated fever, diarrhea, vaginal bleeding, or discharge. Menarche was at the age of 13 years and her last menstrual period was 4 weeks ago. She uses combination contraceptive pills. She had an appendectomy at the age of 12. Her temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows severe right lower quadrant tenderness with associated rebound and guarding. Pelvic examination shows scant, clear vaginal discharge and right adnexal tenderness. There is no cervical wall motion tenderness. Her hemoglobin concentration is 10.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 9,000/mm3, and platelet count is 250,000/mm3. A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following imaging findings is most likely?\nOptions:\nA. Echogenic tubal ring\nB. Decreased ovarian blood flow on doppler\nC. Complex, echogenic intrauterine mass\nD. Distended fallopian tube with incomplete septations\nE. Increased ovarian blood flow on doppler\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Decreased ovarian blood flow on doppler\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: An investigator is studying the frequency of polycythemia in a population of a remote, mountainous region. A representative sample of 100 men shows a normal distribution of hemoglobin concentration with a mean concentration of 17 g/dL and a standard error of 0.1 g/dL. Which of the following best represents the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL?\nOptions:\nA. 30%\nB. 15%\nC. 95%\nD. 99%\nE. 5%\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: E. 5%\n\nExplanation: Since the distribution of hemoglobin concentrations is normal, we can use the 68-95-99.7 rule to determine the probability. The mean is 17 g/dL, and the standard error is 0.1 g/dL. To find the standard deviation, we can multiply the standard error by the square root of the sample size (100): SD = 0.1 x \u221a100 = 1 g/dL.\n\nA hemoglobin concentration of 18 g/dL is 1 standard deviation above the mean. According to the 68-95-99.7 rule, about 68% of the data points fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean, which means about 32% of the data points fall outside of 1 standard deviation. Since the distribution is symmetrical, half of these (16%) will be above 1 standard deviation, and half will be below. However, we are interested in the probability of a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL, which is more than 1 standard deviation above the mean. This corresponds to the upper tail of the distribution, which is approximately 5% of the data points.",

Explain that you cannot discuss the patient's care without explicit permission from the patient themselves.\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Explain that you cannot discuss the patient's care without explicit permission from the patient themselves.\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 29-year-old primigravid woman at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. She feels well. She has no personal history of serious illness. Medications include iron supplements and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F) and blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 24-week gestation. A 1-hour 50-g glucose challenge shows a glucose concentration of 155 mg/dL (N < 135 mg/dL). A 100-g oral glucose tolerance test shows glucose concentrations of 205 mg/dL (N < 180 mg/dL) and 154 mg/dL (N <140 mg/dL) at 1 and 3 hours, respectively. She refuses treatment with insulin. Which of the following complications is her infant at greatest risk of developing at birth?\nOptions:\nA. Hypocalcemia\nB. Omphalocele\nC. Intrauterine growth restriction\nD. Hypermagnesemia\nE. Hyperglycemia\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Hypocalcemia\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: An investigator is studying bacterial adaptations to the environment in an infectious isolate and a noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B. Animals exposed to the noninfectious isolate do not develop symptoms of infection. The investigator cultivates the noninfectious isolate in a culture with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate. Some of the animals exposed to these bacteria develop symptoms of infection. Which of the following processes is most likely responsible for the described findings?\nOptions:\nA. Conjugation\nB. Reassortment\nC. Transformation\nD. Generalized transduction\nE. Recombination\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Transformation.\n\nThe scenario described in the question suggests that the noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B acquired genetic material from the infectious isolate, which allowed it to become infectious. This is consistent with the process of transformation, where free DNA from one bacterium is taken up by another bacterium, allowing for the transfer of genetic information.\n\nConjugation (A) involves the direct transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another through a specialized structure called a pilus. Reassortment (B) is a process that occurs in viruses, where genetic material is exchanged between different viral strains. Generalized transduction (D) is a process where a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria) accidentally picks up bacterial DNA and transfers it to another bacterium. Recombination (E) is a broader term that refers to the exchange of genetic material between different DNA molecules, but it is not the most specific answer in this case.",

Supraspinatus.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as pain and weakness in the right shoulder, especially with lifting weights, and the physical exam findings, including prominent weakness of external rotation and sudden dropping of the arm when lowering it from an overhead position, are consistent with a supraspinatus injury, likely a rotator cuff tear. The supraspinatus muscle is responsible for abduction of the arm, and weakness in this muscle would cause the patient to drop their arm when trying to lower it slowly.",

A small amount of tuberculin fluid is injected into the subcutaneous tissue on the left forearm. Examination of the injected area 48 hours later shows no induration or erythema. Impairment of which of the following processes is the most likely cause of the negative tuberculin skin test seen in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Secretion of interferon-\u03b1\nB. Interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands\nC. Opsonization by complement proteins\nD. Secretion of interleukin-4\nE. Generation of reactive oxygen species\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: B. Interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms and test results suggest that he has tuberculosis (TB). The tuberculin skin test, also known as the PPD test, is used to diagnose TB. A negative result in this patient is likely due to an impaired immune response, which is common in HIV-infected individuals. The interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands is an important step in the activation of T-cells, which are crucial in the immune response to TB. Impaired interaction between B7 and CD28 ligands can lead to a negative tuberculin skin test result.",

Propranolol\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Propranolol.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as confusion, anxiety, sweating, vomiting, tachycardia, and exophthalmos, are consistent with thyroid storm, a life-threatening condition caused by an overactive thyroid gland. The patient's history of taking methimazole, a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism, and the recent development of an upper respiratory infection suggest that the thyroid storm may be triggered by the infection.\n\nPropranolol, a beta-blocker, is often used to treat thyroid storm by reducing the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia, anxiety, and tremors. It can also help to reduce the peripheral effects of excessive thyroid hormone.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the treatment of thyroid storm:\n\nA. Antibiotics may be necessary to treat the underlying infection, but they are not the primary treatment for thyroid storm.\n\nB. Carotid massage is not a treatment for thyroid storm.\n\nC. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that may be used to treat anxiety, but it is not a specific treatment for thyroid storm.\n\nD. Epinephrine is not typically used to treat thyroid storm, and it may even exacerbate the condition by increasing heart rate and blood pressure.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question. A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A 72-year-old woman presents to the emergency department complaining of left gluteal pain for the last 3 months. The onset of the pain was gradual and she does not recall any trauma to the region. She describes the pain as sharp and progressive, with radiation down the posterior left thigh to the level of the knee. She is a non-smoker without a history of anticoagulant therapy. Her past medical history is significant for peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The physical examination focusing on the left gluteal region reveals atrophy and muscle weakness. The blood cell count and blood chemistry profile are within normal limits. The suspected embolus was confirmed with a pelvic computed tomography scan demonstrating a heterogeneously-enhanced blockage in the deep branch of the superior gluteal artery. The patient underwent an uneventful super-selective embolization and recovered well. Complete occlusion of this artery may cause muscle ischemia and atrophy that would compromise the ability to perform which of the following actions?\nOptions:\nA. Rise from a sitting position\nB. Walking\nC. Climbing stairs\nD. Standing\nE. Running\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Walking\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 51-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and fatigue for the past 2 months. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs or bruits. Coarse crackles are heard at the lung bases bilaterally. An ECG shows an irregularly irregular rhythm with absent p waves. An x-ray of the chest shows globular enlargement of the cardiac shadow with prominent hila and bilateral fluffy infiltrates. Transthoracic echocardiography shows a dilated left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 40%. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?\nOptions:\nA. Uncontrolled essential hypertension\nB. Chronic supraventricular tachycardia\nC. Deposition of misfolded proteins\nD. Inherited \u03b2-myosin heavy chain mutation\nE. Acute psychological stress\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Chronic supraventricular tachycardia\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 60-year-old man presents to the emergency room with a chief complaint of constipation. His history is also significant for weakness, a dry cough, weight loss, recurrent kidney stones, and changes in his mood. He has a 30 pack-year history of smoking. A chest x-ray reveals a lung mass. Labs reveal a calcium of 14. What is the first step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Begin alendronate\nB. Administer calcitonin\nC. Begin furosemide\nD. Administer intravenous fluids\nE. Begin hydrochlorothiazide\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Administer intravenous fluids\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because he was vomiting and seemed abnormally sleepy at home. On presentation, he is found to be confused and very lethargic. His parents said that he has had a fever and cough for several days prior to presentation and was given an over the counter medication. Physical exam of this patient reveals mild hepatomegaly and dry mucous membranes. Which of the following effects would the drug most likely also have on the nephron?\nOptions:\nA. Constriction of afferent arteriole and constriction of efferent arteriole\nB. Constriction of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole\nC. Dilation of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole\nD. No effect on afferent arteriole and constriction of efferent arteriole\nE. No effect on afferent arteriole and dilation of efferent arteriole\n\nResponse: The correct answer is: C. Dilation of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole.\n\nThe scenario suggests that the boy has taken an over-the-counter medication, likely acetaminophen, which can cause liver damage and lead to hepatomegaly. Acetaminophen can also cause vasodilation, which would lead to dilation of the afferent arteriole in the nephron, increasing blood flow to the glomerulus. There is no indication that it would affect the efferent arteriole.",

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in treatment?\"\nOptions:\nA. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)\nB. Prednisone\nC. Botulism antitoxin\nD. Intravenous acyclovir\nE. Gabapentin\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including sudden onset of weakness in the lower extremities, sensory loss, and absent reflexes, are consistent with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). The laboratory results, including a normal complete blood count, electrolyte panel, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, support this diagnosis. IVIG is a commonly used treatment for GBS, as it can help reduce the severity and duration of the illness.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of worsening confusion and lethargy for the last hour. He has had high-grade fever, productive cough, fatigue, and malaise for 2 days. He was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia at the age of 2 years but has not seen a physician in over a year. His temperature is 38.9\u00b0C (102\u00b0F), pulse is 133/min, respirations are 33/min, and blood pressure is 86/48 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient does not respond to verbal commands. Examination shows conjunctival pallor and scleral icterus. Inspiratory crackles are heard at the left lung base. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 8.1 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 17,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 200,000/mm3\nWhich of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?\"\nOptions:\nA. Chronic transfusion therapy\nB. Polysaccharide vaccination\nC. Folic acid\nD. Hydroxyurea\nE. Low molecular weight heparin\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Polysaccharide vaccination\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 55-year-old man presents with fever, chills, fatigue, cough, sore throat, and breathlessness for the past 7 days. He describes the cough as productive and says he is fatigued all the time. He says he is a farmer with daily contact with rabbits, horses, sheep, pigeons, and chickens and reports cleaning the barn 3 days before his symptoms started. The patient denies any history of tick bites. Past medical history is irrelevant. His temperature is 39.4\u00b0C (103.0\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 26/min. On physical examination, there are decreased breath sounds on the right side. A large tender node is palpable in the right axilla. A chest radiograph reveals multiple homogenous opacities in the lower lobe of the right lung and a right-sided pleural effusions. Gram staining of a sputum sample is negative for any organism. Serology tests are negative. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism for this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. Francisella tularensis\nB. Bacillus anthracis\nC. Staphylococcus aureus \nD. Yersinia pestis\nE. Mycoplasma pneumoniae\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Francisella tularensis\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 54-year-old man with hypertension and congenital blindness comes to the physician because he is unable to recognize objects by touch with his right hand. The symptoms started about 2 hours ago. When given a house key, he can feel the object in his right hand but is not able to identify what it is. This patient's condition is most likely caused by a lesion in which of the following locations?\nOptions:\nA. Ipsilateral inferior frontal gyrus\nB. Ipsilateral superior temporal gyrus\nC. Contralateral superior parietal lobule\nD. Contralateral precentral gyrus\nE. Ipsilateral cingulate gyrus\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Contralateral superior parietal lobule\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 35-year-old Caucasian female presents to the hospital alarmed by her recent truncal weight gain, facial hair growth, and thinning skin. During the physical exam, the physician finds that the patient is hypertensive. Serum analysis reveals hyperglycemia. The physician suspects a pituitary adenoma. Which dexamethasone test result would help confirm the physician's suspicions?\nOptions:\nA. Low-dose, increased ACTH; high-dose, increased ACTH\nB. Low-dose, increased ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH\nC. Low-dose, decrease in ACTH; high-dose, no change in ACTH\nD. Low-dose, no change in ACTH; high-dose, no change in ACTH\nE. Low-dose, no change in ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Low-dose, increased ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH.\n\nThis question is related to Cushing's syndrome, which is caused by excess cortisol production. The physician suspects a pituitary adenoma, which would lead to an increase in ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) production, stimulating the adrenal glands to produce more cortisol.\n\nThe dexamethasone suppression test is used to diagnose Cushing's syndrome. In this test, a low dose of dexamethasone is administered, and if ACTH levels increase, it suggests that the pituitary gland is producing excess ACTH, which is consistent with a pituitary adenoma. If a high dose of dexamethasone is then administered and ACTH levels decrease, it confirms that the pituitary adenoma is responsive to feedback inhibition, which is a characteristic of pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. Low-dose, increased ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH.",

Inclusions of denatured hemoglobin\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Erythrocytes with a ring of relative pallor.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of sideroblastic anemia, which is a type of anemia characterized by the presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow. Ring sideroblasts are abnormal red blood cell precursors that have a ring of iron deposits around the nucleus. This is reflected in the patient's iron studies, which show elevated iron and ferritin levels.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, and physical examination findings, such as a positive fluid wave and depapillated tongue, are also consistent with sideroblastic anemia. The other options are not directly related to sideroblastic anemia:\n\nA. Erythroblasts with mitochondrial iron deposits are seen in sideroblastic anemia, but this is not the most likely finding in this patient.\n\nB. Erythrocytes lacking central pallor are seen in spherocytosis, not sideroblastic anemia.\n\nD. Hypochromatic erythrocytes are seen in iron deficiency anemia, which is not consistent with the patient's iron studies.\n\nE. Inclusions of denatured hemoglobin are seen in sickle cell disease, which is not related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.",

Intravenous adenosine\nE. Aspirin\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Vagal maneuvers\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 41-year-old man is admitted to the emergency room after being struck in the abdomen by a large cement plate while transporting it. On initial assessment by paramedics at the scene, his blood pressure was 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate 85/min, with no signs of respiratory distress. On admission, the patient is alert but in distress. He complains of severe, diffuse, abdominal pain and severe weakness. Vital signs are now: blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate 96/min, respiratory rate 19/min, temperature 37.4\u2103 (99.3\u2109), and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. His lungs are clear on auscultation. The cardiac exam is significant for a narrow pulse pressure. Abdominal examination reveals a large bruise over the epigastric and periumbilical regions. The abdomen is distended and there is diffuse tenderness to palpation with rebound and guarding, worst in the epigastric region. There is hyperresonance to percussion in the epigastric region and absence of hepatic dullness in the right upper quadrant. Aspiration of the nasogastric tube reveals bloody contents. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) shows free fluid in the pelvic region. Evaluation of the perisplenic and perihepatic regions is impossible due to the presence of free air. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation is administered but fails to improve upon the patient\u2019s hemodynamics. Which of the following is the next best step in management?\nOptions:\nA. CT scan\nB. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL)\nC. Abdominal ultrasound\nD. Emergency laparotomy\nE. Emergency laparoscopy\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Emergency laparotomy\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of progressive pain and stiffness of the fingers of her right hand. The stiffness is worse at the end of the day. She recently retired after working for 28 years as a typist at a data entry firm. Physical examination shows swelling, joint-line tenderness, and decreased range of motion of the first metacarpophalangeal joint and the distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand. Discrete, hard, mildly tender nodules are palpated over the 2nd and 4th distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand. An x-ray of her right hand shows narrowing of the interphalangeal joint spaces with subchondral sclerosis and osteophytes. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's condition?\nOptions:\nA. Monosodium urate crystal precipitation in the joints\nB. Bacterial infection of the joint space\nC. Autoimmune-mediated cartilage erosion\nD. Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal precipitation in the joints\nE. Degenerative disease of the joints\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Degenerative disease of the joints.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including progressive pain and stiffness of the fingers, swelling, joint-line tenderness, and decreased range of motion, are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA). The presence of discrete, hard, mildly tender nodules over the distal interphalangeal joints, known as Heberden's nodes, is a characteristic feature of OA. The x-ray findings of narrowing of the interphalangeal joint spaces with subchondral sclerosis and osteophytes also support the diagnosis of OA. OA is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage and bone in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and limited mobility.",

His symptoms began approximately 3 days prior to presentation and have not improved. His mother also reports that he developed diarrhea recently and denies any sick contacts or recent travel. He has received all of his vaccinations. Medical history is significant for pneumonia and a lung abscess of staphylococcal origin, and osteomyelitis caused by Serratia marcescens. Physical examination demonstrates growth failure and dermatitis. Laboratory testing is remarkable for hypergammaglobulinemia and a non-hemolytic and normocytic anemia. Work-up of his productive cough reveals that it is pneumonia caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. Which of the following is most likely the immune system defect that will be found in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. ATM gene defect\nB. LFA-1 integrin defect\nC. Lysosomal trafficking regulator gene defect\nD. NAPDH oxidase defect\nE. WASP gene mutation\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, NAPDH oxidase defect\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A group of scientists is conducting an experiment on the human cells involved in the immune response. They genetically modify B cells so they do not express the cluster of differentiation 21 (CD21) on their cell surfaces.

She has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications. Her temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Pelvic examination shows pain with movement of the cervix and mucopurulent cervical discharge. A Gram stain of the discharge does not show any organisms. A Giemsa stain shows intracytoplasmic inclusions. The patient's current condition puts her at increased risk for which of the following complications?\nOptions:\nA. Cervical cancer\nB. Endometriosis\nC. Aortic root dilatation\nD. Purulent arthritis\nE. Ectopic pregnancy\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Ectopic pregnancy\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 3-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her mother 30 minutes after the sudden onset of shortness of breath, dizziness, abdominal pain, and urticaria. The symptoms began 5 minutes after she ate a peanut butter sandwich. Her respirations are 36/min and blood pressure is 84/50 mm Hg. There is stridor on auscultation of the chest. She is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and the appropriate pharmacotherapy are begun. The drug administered to this patient most likely has which of the following effects on cardiac pacemaker cells during an action potential?\nOptions:\nA. Increased Ca2+ influx in phase 4\nB. Increased Na+ influx in phase 3\nC. Decreased Ca2+ influx in phase 0\nD. Increased K+ efflux in phase 4\nE. Decreased K+ efflux during phase 3\n\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Decreased K+ efflux during phase 3.\n\nThe patient is experiencing anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, likely due to a peanut allergy. The symptoms and treatment described are consistent with anaphylaxis. The drug administered to this patient is likely epinephrine, which is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis.\n\nEpinephrine has several effects on the body, including increasing heart rate and contractility. In cardiac pacemaker cells, epinephrine decreases potassium efflux during phase 3 of the action potential, which helps to increase the heart rate. This is because potassium efflux is responsible for repolarization of the cardiac cell, and decreasing it allows the cell to remain depolarized for longer, increasing the heart rate.",

Family history is noncontributory. Her blood pressure is 119/81 mm Hg, heart rate is 101/min, respiratory rate is 21/min, and temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical examination, the patient has severe edema over her face and severe stridor with inspiration at the base of both lungs. Of the following options, this patient is likely experiencing which of the following hypersensitivity reactions?\nOptions:\nA. Type 1 - anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction\nB. Type 2 - cytotoxic hypersensitivity reaction\nC. Type 3 - immune complex mediated hypersensitivity reaction \nD. Type 4 - cell mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction\nE. Both A & B\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Type 1 - anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 40-year-old man is rushed to the emergency department after being involved in a motor vehicle accident. He has lacerations on his right arm and some minor abrasions on his face and lower limbs. The resident on call quickly manages the patient with proper care of his open wounds in the emergency department. The patient is admitted to the surgery unit for the daily care of his wounds. His lacerations begin to heal with proper dressing and occasional debridement. Which of the following best describes the healing process in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Abundant lymphocytes accumulate during the healing process, forming a granuloma.\nB. The formation of granulation tissue is not affected by factors such as blood sugar and decreased circulation of blood.\nC. Healing by secondary intention will occur along with the deposition of large amount of granulation tissue.\nD. Healing involves abscess formation, which should be drained.\nE. Healing by primary intention will occur without granulation tissue formation.\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Healing by secondary intention will occur along with the deposition of large amount of granulation tissue.\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 55-year-old man is brought to the physician because of inappropriate behavior for the past 6 months. He has been making inappropriate comments and jokes while talking to friends and family members. He was arrested 3 weeks ago while trying to kiss strangers on the street. He has no interest in talking to his daughter or playing with his grandchildren. During this period, he has developed a strong desire for chocolate pudding and potato chips and has gained 10 kg (22 lb). He appears unkempt. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. Mental status examination shows apathy and a blunt affect. He avoids answering questions and instead comments on the individuals he saw in the waiting room. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 28/30. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of glucose, creatine, and electrolytes are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Parkinson disease\nB. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nC. Normal pressure hydrocephalus\nD. Wilson disease\nE. Frontotemporal dementia\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Frontotemporal dementia\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She feels well. Six months ago, she was vaccinated against influenza. Her last mammography 1 year ago showed no abnormalities. Two years ago, a pap smear and colonoscopy were normal. She has a history of hypertension. Her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 50 years. She emigrated from Japan 30 years ago. She has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for the last 18 years. She drinks 4\u20135 glasses of wine per day. She goes ballroom dancing twice each week. Her medications include enalapril and low-dose aspirin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 50 kg (110 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows a soft S4 gallop. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Pap smear\nB. Dual-energy x-ray bone absorptiometry\nC. Abdominal ultrasonography\nD. Low-dose chest CT\nE. Transesophageal echocardiography\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: B, Dual-energy x-ray bone absorptiometry\n\nExplanation: The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and smoking. She is also a light drinker and engages in regular physical activity. Her BMI is 18 kg/m2, which indicates that she is underweight. Given her age and risk factors, the most appropriate next step in management would be to screen for osteoporosis using dual-energy x-ray bone absorptiometry (DXA). This is because osteoporosis is a common condition in postmenopausal women, and early detection and treatment can help prevent fractures and other complications.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 36 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department for 2 hours of contractions. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. The contractions occur once every 20\u201330 minutes, last less than 30 seconds, and have been consistent in intensity and duration since onset. During that time there has been an increase in fetal movements. Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.8\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 104/76 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows clear cervical mucus and a firm uterus consistent in size with a 36-week gestation. The cervix is 0% effaced and undilated; the vertex is at -3 station. The fetal heart rate is reassuring. After an hour of monitoring in the emergency department, the character of the contractions and pelvic examination findings remain unchanged. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\nOptions:\nA. Administer tocolytics\nB. Offer local or regional anesthesia\nC. Admit for continuous monitoring\nD. Reassurance and discharge\nE. Perform cesarean delivery\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Reassurance and discharge\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 72-year-old man is brought into clinic by his daughter for increasing confusion. The daughter states that over the past 2 weeks, she has noticed that the patient \u201cseems to stare off into space.\u201d She reports he has multiple episodes a day during which he will walk into a room and forget why. She is also worried about his balance. She endorses that he has had several falls, the worst being 3 weeks ago when he tripped on the sidewalk getting the mail. The patient denies loss of consciousness, pre-syncope, chest pain, palpitations, urinary incontinence, or bowel incontinence. He complains of headache but denies dizziness. He reports nausea and a few episodes of non-bloody emesis but denies abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea. The patient\u2019s medical history is significant for atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. He takes aspirin, warfarin, insulin, lisinopril, simvastatin, and ibuprofen. He drinks a half glass of whisky after dinner every night and smokes a cigar on the weekends. On physical examination, he is oriented to name and place but not to date. He is unable to spell \"world\" backward. When asked to remember 3 words, he recalls only 2. There are no motor or sensory deficits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Alzheimer disease\nB. Ischemic stroke\nC. Normal pressure hydrocephalus\nD. Subdural hematoma\nE.

The physical examination reveals diaphoresis. The serum laboratory parameters are as follows:\nNa+ 136 mEq/L\nCl- 99 mEq/L\nArterial blood gas analysis under room air indicates the following results:\npH 7.39\nPaCO2 25 mm HG\nHCO3- 15 mEq/L\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate first step in the management of this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Gastrointestinal decontamination\nB. Hemodialysis\nC. Multiple-dose activated charcoal\nD. Supportive care\nE. Urine alkalinization\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Supportive care\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 25-year-old female with Hodgkin's lymphoma presents with a several day history of edema. Lab studies show:\n\nSerum Na+: 140 mmol/L\nSerum K+: 3.5 mmol/L\nSerum albumin: 1.9 g/dL\nTotal serum bilirubin: 1.0 mg/dL\nSerum creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL\n\nUrinalysis shows 4+ proteinuria and fatty casts. What is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\nB. Membranous nephropathy\nC. Minimal change disease\nD. Amyloidosis\nE. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Minimal change disease.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of edema and laboratory results, including proteinuria and fatty casts in the urinalysis, suggest a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. The low serum albumin level (1.9 g/dL) is also consistent with nephrotic syndrome. Among the options, minimal change disease is the most likely diagnosis, as it is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in young adults and is often associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A research group designed a study to investigate the epidemiology of syphilis in the United States. After a review of medical records, the investigators identified patients who were active cocaine users, but did not have a history of syphilis. They subsequently examined the patient's medical charts to determine whether this same group of patients was more likely to develop syphilis over a 6-month period. The investigators ultimately found that the rate of syphilis was 30% higher in patients with active cocaine use compared to patients without cocaine use. This study is best described as which of the following?\nOptions:\nA. Prospective cohort study\nB. Case-control study\nC. Meta-analysis\nD. Cross-sectional study\nE. Retrospective cohort study\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Retrospective cohort study\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 34-year-old man presents to the emergency department by ambulance after being involved in a fight. On arrival, there is obvious trauma to his face and neck, and his mouth is full of blood. Seconds after suctioning the blood, his mouth rapidly fills up with blood again. As a result, he is unable to speak to you. An attempt at direct laryngoscopy fails as a result of his injuries. His vital signs are pulse 102/min, blood pressure 110/75 mmHg, and O2 saturation 97%. Which of the following is indicated at this time?\nOptions:\nA. Endotracheal intubation\nB. Cricothyroidotomy\nC. Nasogastric tube\nD. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\nE. Cardiopulmonary resusication\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Cricothyroidotomy\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 27-year-old woman, who recently immigrated from Bangladesh, presents to her primary care physician to discuss birth control. During a review of her past medical history, she reports that as a child she had a recurrent sore throat and fever followed by swollen and aching hip and knee joints. These symptoms returned every season and were never treated but went away on their own only to return with the next typhoon season. When asked about any current complaints, the patient says that she sometimes has shortness of breath and palpitations that do not last long. A physical exam is performed. In which of the auscultation sites will a murmur most likely be heard in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Point 1\nB. Point 2\nC. Point 3\nD. Point 4\nE. Point 5\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Point 5\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 7-year-old woman presents shortly after her birthday with red scaly plaques over both ears. Her mother reports that the patient recently received a pair of fashionable silver earrings from her older sister as a birthday present. Physical examination is only significant for erythema and tenderness over the lobules of the ears bilaterally. Her vital signs show a blood pressure of 121/73 mm Hg, heart rate of 72/min, and a respiratory rate of 21/min. Her medical history is non-significant. Of the following options, which is the mechanism of this reaction?\nOptions:\nA. Type I\u2013anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction\nB. Type II\u2013cytotoxic hypersensitivity reaction\nC. Type III\u2013immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction\nD. Type IV\u2013cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction\nE. Type III and IV\u2013mixed immune complex and cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Type IV\u2013cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction.\n\nThis is a classic example of contact dermatitis, which is a type of delayed hypersensitivity reaction. The patient's symptoms, such as red scaly plaques and tenderness over the earlobes, are consistent with an allergic reaction to the silver earrings. Type IV hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by T cells and typically occur 24-48 hours after exposure to an antigen, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms appearing after wearing the earrings.",

He was born at home and had unreliable prenatal care because his parents have been experiencing housing instability. About a day after birth, he started to become lethargic and was feeding poorly. His parents thought that he might just be tired so they put him to bed; however, by the next morning he started to vomit and act extremely irritable. On presentation, he is found to have nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelles. Based on this presentation, appropriate cultures are obtained and he is placed on empiric antibiotics. After all cultures grow out the same gram-positive bacteria, the patient is narrowed to penicillin G. Which of the following is a characteristic of the most likely organism that is causing this patient's symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Creates a green zone of hemolysis on blood agar\nB. Enlarges hemolytic area of Staphylococcus aureus\nC. Produces lipooligosaccharide rather than lipopolysaccharide\nD. Produces toxin that increases cAMP levels\nE. Tumbling motility in broth at 22 degrees\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: E, Tumbling motility in broth at 22 degrees\n\nThe symptoms described, such as vomiting, irritability, nuchal rigidity, and bulging fontanelles, are consistent with meningitis in a newborn. The fact that the cultures grew a gram-positive bacteria and the patient was narrowed to penicillin G suggests that the most likely organism is Listeria monocytogenes. Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause meningitis in newborns, and it is characterized by its tumbling motility in broth at 22\u00b0C.",

She has a history of sleep apnea. Examination of the lower extremities shows bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema. Cardiac examination shows a widely split S2 that varies with respiration. An ECG shows right bundle branch block. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema?\nOptions:\nA. Localized lymphatic obstruction\nB. Dermal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans\nC. Thrombus formation in a deep vein\nD. Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure\nE. Decreased plasma oncotic pressure\n\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and ankle swelling, suggest heart failure. The physical examination findings, including a widely split S2 that varies with respiration and right bundle branch block on ECG, are consistent with right heart failure. The most likely etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema is increased capillary hydrostatic pressure due to right heart failure, which leads to increased pressure in the capillaries and subsequent fluid leakage into the interstitial space, causing edema.",

She reports that for the past 3 years, she has experienced several periods of depressed mood. The episodes do not coincide with any specific life events and seem to resolve after 4-6 weeks. During these episodes, she experiences a depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and a poor appetite, but she at times is able to enjoy spending time with her children and husband but other times she is distressed and cannot enjoy time with them. Upon further questioning, she also reports experiencing occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years. During these episodes, she is very productive at her work as a lawyer and requires less sleep than usual. Her past medical history is notable for obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. She is on insulin and takes methotrexate. She smokes marijuana occasionally. Her temperature is 99.2\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 124/80 mmHg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, she is quiet with a flattened affect, but is cooperative and answers questions thoroughly. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Bipolar I disorder\nB. Bipolar II disorder\nC. Cyclothymic disorder\nD. Persistent depressive disorder\nE. Schizoaffective disorder\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Cyclothymic disorder.\n\nThe patient's symptoms meet the criteria for cyclothymic disorder, which is a mood disorder characterized by periods of depressed mood and periods of elevated mood that are not severe enough to meet the criteria for major depressive episodes or manic episodes. The patient's episodes of depressed mood last for 4-6 weeks, which is consistent with cyclothymic disorder, and she also experiences episodes of elevated mood that increase her productivity and reduce her need for sleep. The patient's ability to experience pleasure during her depressive episodes and her lack of psychotic symptoms also support this diagnosis.\n\nBipolar I disorder (A) is unlikely because the patient's elevated mood episodes are not severe enough to meet the criteria for manic episodes. Bipolar II disorder (B) is also unlikely because the patient's elevated mood episodes are not severe enough to meet the criteria for hypomanic episodes. Persistent depressive disorder (D) is unlikely because the patient's depressive episodes are not continuous and she experiences periods of elevated mood. Schizoaffective disorder (E) is unlikely because the patient does not exhibit psychotic symptoms.",

Increased vital capacity\nC. Decreased residual volume\nD. Increased chest wall compliance\nE. Decreased A-a gradient\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Decreased A-a gradient.\n\nAs people age, their respiratory function changes. One of the changes that occurs is a decrease in the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-a gradient), which is the difference between the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli and the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood. This decrease is due to a decline in lung function and a decrease in the diffusion capacity of oxygen across the alveolar-capillary membrane.",

His mother says that these symptoms developed approximately 2 years ago. The patient was exclusively breastfed up to the age of 7 months. Supplementary feeding was started with non-starchy vegetable followed by starchy vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, and bread. Bread and cookies were the last product to be introduced at the age of 12 months. The patient\u2019s mother tried to withdraw dairy products from the patient\u2019s diet because she heard that lactose can cause such symptoms, but it did not help. The patient\u2019s vital signs include: blood pressure 90/55 mm Hg, heart rate 101/min, respiratory rate 19/min, and temperature 36.3\u2103 (97.3\u2109). His weight is 11 kg (24.2 lb, -2 SD) and height is 90 cm (2 ft 11 in, -1 SD). On physical examination, the patient\u2019s skin is pale with a papulovesicular rash on his abdomen and back. There are a few aphthous ulcers in the oral cavity. The abdomen is distended but no tenderness to palpation. No hepatosplenomegaly. An immunological assay is performed and shows positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies. Which of the following changes would you most likely expect to see on intestinal biopsy in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Granulomas in the submucous tissue\nB. Crypt abscesses\nC. Villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy\nD. Mucosal eosinophilia\nE. Villous hyperplasia\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: C, Villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms, such as episodic diarrhea, malodorous stools, stunted growth, and itchy rash, are consistent with celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder caused by a reaction to gluten. The presence of anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies further supports this diagnosis. On intestinal biopsy, the characteristic finding in celiac disease is villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy, which is a flattening of the villi and an increase in the size of the crypts in the small intestine. This leads to malabsorption of nutrients, resulting in the patient's symptoms.",

Her height and weight are appropriate for her age, and she is up to date on all her vaccinations and has no medical complaints. She is doing well in school and has a part-time job stocking shelves at a clothing store. She was offered a higher-paying job as a cashier at the store, but she declined. She is very shy and withdrawn with the physician. Afterwards, her mother asks to speak to the physician alone and expresses concern that her daughter is very socially isolated and feels lonely. She is also worried that her daughter is extremely sensitive to criticism, even from family. The daughter is interested in art and music, but hasn\u2019t participated in any extracurriculars because she says that she is untalented and thinks nobody wants to hang out with her. When her mother has encouraged her to invite friends over, the daughter bursts into tears and says, \u201cNobody wants to be friends with me, I am too lame and ugly and I just know I\u2019ll end up getting rejected.\u201d Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the daughter\u2019s behavior?\nOptions:\nA. Schizotypal personality disorder\nB. Generalized anxiety disorder\nC. Avoidant personality disorder\nD. Paranoid personality disorder\nE. Dependent personality disorder\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Avoidant personality disorder.\n\nThe daughter's behavior, as described, is consistent with avoidant personality disorder. She is shy and withdrawn, socially isolated, and extremely sensitive to criticism. She has a negative self-image, believing herself to be \"lame and ugly,\" and fears rejection. She avoids social interactions and extracurricular activities due to her fear of criticism or rejection. These characteristics are all hallmarks of avoidant personality disorder.\n\nSchizotypal personality disorder (A) is characterized by eccentric behavior, odd thinking, and social isolation, but it does not typically involve fear of rejection or criticism.\n\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (B) is characterized by excessive worry and anxiety, but it does not typically involve social isolation or fear of rejection.\n\nParanoid personality disorder (D) is characterized by suspiciousness and mistrust of others, but it does not typically involve fear of rejection or criticism.\n\nDependent personality disorder (E) is characterized by an excessive need to be taken care of and a fear of separation, but it does not typically involve social isolation or fear of rejection.",

Failure of development of the left maxillary prominence\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Failure of fusion of the left maxillary prominence and the medial nasal process of the frontonasal prominence\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 38-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of increasing shortness of breath over the past 2 months. He reports experiencing an extended illness of several weeks as a child that required him to miss school. He is unsure but believes it involved a sore throat followed by a fever and joint pains. He does not recall seeing a physician or receiving treatment for this. Today, on physical examination, cardiac auscultation reveals an opening snap after the second heart sound followed by a diastolic murmur. A follow-up echocardiogram is conducted. Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology of this patient's condition?\nOptions:\nA. Annular calcification\nB. Epitope homology\nC. Myocardial ischemia\nD. Atherosclerosis\nE. Congenital heart defect\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Epitope homology\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: An otherwise healthy 57-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of progressive shortness of breath and exercise intolerance for the past 5 days. He denies recent travel or illicit habits. His temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 88/57 mm Hg, and the pulse is 102/min. The radial pulse becomes so weak with inspiration. Physical examination reveals bilateral 1+ pedal edema. There is jugular venous distention at 13 cm and muffled heart sounds. Transthoracic echocardiogram shows reciprocal respiratory ventricular inflow and ventricular diastolic collapse. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient condition?\nOptions:\nA. Cardiac catheterization\nB. Pericardiectomy\nC. Pericardial drainage\nD. Chest X-ray\nE. Cardiac MRI\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Pericardial drainage\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of periodic painful double vision for 3 days. Her symptoms occur only when looking sideways. She has myopia and has been wearing corrective lenses for 10 years. Ten days ago, she lost her balance and fell off her bike, for which she went to a hospital. A CT scan of the head at that time showed no abnormalities and she was released without further treatment. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Her best corrected visual acuity is 20/40 in each eye. She has an adduction deficit in the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left; she has an adduction deficit in the left eye and nystagmus in the right eye when looking right. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral disc hyperemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?\nOptions:\nA. Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus\nB. Compressive tumor of the pons\nC. Oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency\nD. Subdural hematoma extending into the orbit\nE. Infarction of the brainstem\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including periodic painful double vision, adduction deficits, and nystagmus, are consistent with a lesion affecting the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), which is a bundle of fibers in the brainstem that coordinates eye movements. The MLF is responsible for adduction (inward movement) of the eye, and damage to this area can cause adduction deficits and nystagmus.\n\nThe patient's history of a recent head injury and normal CT scan suggest that the lesion is likely a demyelinating injury, rather than a structural lesion such as a tumor or hematoma. The bilateral disc hyperemia on fundoscopy also supports this diagnosis, as it is a common finding in demyelinating diseases.\n\nDemyelination of the MLF is a common cause of internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), which is a syndrome characterized by adduction deficits and nystagmus. The other options are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms.",

This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants\nPulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants\nPlacebo: 395 participants\nTable 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value\nPlaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 \u00b1 2.8 1.2 \u00b1 4.7 15.8 \u00b1 2.9 < 0.01\nLDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 \u00b1 3.6 -11.2 \u00b1 14.3 -8.4 \u00b1 3.9 0.28\nFEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 \u00b1 2.21 0.34 \u00b1 5.54 -0.22 \u00b1 3.21 0.27\nACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 \u00b1 1.22 0.46 \u00b1 3.25 0.12 \u00b1 1.33 0.43\nConclusion:\nPulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.\nSource of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health\"\nOptions:\nA. Pearson correlation analysis\nB. Chi-square test\nC. Analysis of variance\nD. Meta-analysis\nE. Kaplan-Meier analysis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Analysis of variance.\n\nThe cardiologist wants to compare the changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up between the three groups (pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, and placebo). Since there are multiple groups and continuous outcome variables, the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups is Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). ANOVA is used to determine whether there are significant differences between the means of three or more groups.",

He has a police record which includes vandalism, shoplifting, and running away on two occasions. He has also received several detentions and threats of expulsion from school due to bullying and being too aggressive with the younger students. Past medical history is significant for a history of ADHD previously treated with methylphenidate, but now he does not take anything. His biological family placed him and his sister into the foster care system. His step-parents try to provide support and nurturing home life but the patient is very resistant and often acts out. What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Antisocial personality disorder\nB. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nC. Conduct disorder\nD. Oppositional defiant disorder\nE. Schizoid personality disorder\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Conduct disorder\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 57-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. During the last 6 months, he has had recurring pneumonia after undergoing a surgical operation. He reports that, when food has gone down his windpipe, he has not automatically coughed.

IgA deficiency\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, IgA deficiency\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 78-year-old right-handed man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for sudden onset speech changes. The patient lives with his daughter and was chatting with her when suddenly his speech became distorted with random and disconnected words that made no sense. He seems to be physically frustrated that no one understands him. Physical examination demonstrates weakness of the right arm. Damage to which location would best explain this patient\u2019s symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Left frontal lobe\nB. Left internal capsule\nC. Left temporal lobe\nD. Right frontal lobe\nE. Right temporal lobe\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Left frontal lobe.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including sudden onset of distorted speech with random and disconnected words, and weakness of the right arm, suggest a lesion in the left frontal lobe, specifically in Broca's area. This area is responsible for language processing, particularly speech production, and is also involved in motor control of the right arm. Damage to this area would result in expressive aphasia, characterized by difficulty speaking in grammatically correct sentences, and hemiparesis of the right arm.",

She has had 3-10 malodorous and loose bowel movements daily for the last 6 months, though she recalls that her bowel movements started increasing in frequency nearly 2 years ago. She was otherwise healthy until 2 years ago, when she had multiple elevated fasting blood glucose levels and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. She was also hospitalized once 6 months ago for epigastric pain that was determined to be due to cholelithiasis. She is an avid runner and runs 3-4 marathons per year. She is a vegetarian and takes all appropriate supplements. Her body mass index is 19 kg/m^2. She has lost 10 pounds since her last visit 18 months ago. On exam, she has dry mucous membranes and decreased skin turgor. A high-resolution spiral computerized tomography scan demonstrates a 5-cm enhancing lesion in the head of the pancreas. Additional similar lesions are found in the liver. Further laboratory workup confirms the diagnosis. The patient is offered surgery but refuses as she reportedly had a severe complication from anesthesia as a child.

A pregnancy test is positive.\n\nWhich of the following is an appropriate next step in diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Transabdominal ultrasound.\nB. Dilation and curettage\nC. Transvaginal ultrasound\nD. Methotrexate and discharge with strict follow-up instructions.\nE. Exploratory laparotomy\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Transvaginal ultrasound\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 68-year-old woman presents with an intermittent throbbing headache with an onset approximately 3 weeks ago. The pain is bilateral, \u201cband-like,\u201d and extends to the neck. The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.5\u2103 (97.7\u2109). The physical examination reveals S2 accentuation that is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border. Palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless. The neurologic exam shows no focal symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism underlying the patient\u2019s headaches?\nOptions:\nA. Meningeal irritation by blood products originating from a chronic subdural hematoma\nB. Dissection of an intracerebral vessel\nC. Pressure created by the content of the paranasal sinuses\nD. Meningeal irritation by a growing intracranial neoplasm\nE. Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: E. Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of tension headache, which is the most common type of headache. The characteristics of the headache, such as bilateral location, band-like quality, and worsening with coughing or laughing, are typical of tension headaches. The patient's medical history, including hypertension and stable angina pectoris, suggests that the headache may be related to vasodilation, which is a common mechanism underlying tension headaches. The patient's recent upper respiratory tract infection may have triggered the headache. The physical examination findings, including S2 accentuation, are consistent with hypertension, but do not suggest any other underlying conditions that could be causing the headache.",

His father recently passed away, and his mother states she just lost her job. She has been unable to buy food regularly, and they have had to eat boiled and preserved vegetables. His mother denies that the boy has any prior medical conditions, but the patient states that his gums bleed when he brushes his teeth. On exam, the patient's vital signs are normal, but he appears malnourished. There is gum hypertrophy present on exam along with small, curled hairs over his head. CBC is significant for a Hgb of 9.5 g/dL with an MCV of 85. PT, aPTT, and bleeding time are all normal. What is the most likely cause?\nOptions:\nA. Vitamin K deficiency\nB. Vitamin C deficiency\nC. Vitamin B12 deficiency\nD. Iron deficiency\nE. Vitamin B3 deficiency\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Vitamin C deficiency\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 57-year-old man presents with acute-onset nausea and left flank pain. He says his symptoms suddenly started 10 hours ago and have not improved. He describes the pain as severe, colicky, intermittent, and localized to the left flank. The patient denies any fever, chills, or dysuria. His past medical history is significant for nephrolithiasis, incidentally diagnosed 10 months ago on a routine ultrasound, for which he has not been treated. His family history is unremarkable. The patient is afebrile, and his vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, he is writhing in pain and moaning. Severe left costovertebral angle tenderness is noted. Gross hematuria is present on urinalysis. A non-contrast CT of the abdomen and pelvis reveals a 12-mm obstructing calculus at the left ureterovesical junction. Initial management, consisting of IV fluid resuscitation, antiemetics, and analgesia, is administered. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Percutaneous nephrostomy\nB. Ureteroscopy\nC. Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy (PCNL)\nD. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL)\nE. 24-hour urine chemistry\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Ureteroscopy\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 28-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of weakness in the fingers of his right hand. One week ago, he experienced sudden pain in his right forearm during weight training. He has no history of serious illness. Physical examination shows impaired flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joints, while flexion of the distal interphalangeal joints is intact. Which of the following muscles is most likely injured?\nOptions:\nA. Palmaris longus\nB. Flexor carpi radialis\nC. Flexor carpi ulnaris\nD. Flexor digitorum superficialis\nE. Flexor digitorum profundus\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Flexor digitorum superficialis\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for sleeping problems and the inability to concentrate for 3 months. She says she is worried because she and her husband have been trying to conceive for more than a year with no success. Conception by in vitro fertilization was attempted once 3 months ago but was unsuccessful. Analysis of her husband's semen has shown normal sperm counts and morphology. She has a 6-year-old daughter who was born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. She has no history of severe illness and tries to stay healthy by going to the gym an hour per day. Her menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 to 6 days; her last menstrual period started 2 days ago. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's inability to conceive?\nOptions:\nA. Pelvic inflammatory disease\nB. Asherman's syndrome\nC. Diminished ovarian reserve\nD. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism\nE. Premature ovarian failure\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: D, Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms of sleeping problems and inability to concentrate, along with her difficulty conceiving, suggest a hormonal imbalance. Her regular menstrual cycles and normal physical examination make pelvic inflammatory disease, Asherman's syndrome, and premature ovarian failure less likely. The fact that she exercises regularly and has a normal menstrual cycle suggests that she may have hypothalamic amenorrhea, which is a form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. This is a condition where the hypothalamus does not produce enough gonadotropin-releasing hormone, leading to decreased follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone production, and ultimately, ovulation and fertility problems.",

She reports that her pain has become more severe over the last several weeks and is no longer well-controlled by NSAIDs. She notes that the pain is beginning to interfere with her sleep and that she feels she no longer has energy to take care of her 2-year-old son. Upon questioning, the patient also endorses feeling more down than usual recently, little interest in seeing friends, and difficulty concentrating on her work. She admits to feeling that she would be \u201cbetter off dead.\u201d The patient feels strongly that the worsening pain is driving these changes in her mood and that she would feel better if her pain was better controlled. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Add acetaminophen and gabapentin to the patient\u2019s pain regimen\nB. Ask the patient if she would voluntarily enter a psychiatric hospital\nC. Ask the patient if she has an idea about how she might hurt herself\nD. Initiate pharmacotherapy with duloxetine and refer for psychotherapy\nE. Initiate pharmacotherapy with amitriptyline and refer for psychotherapy\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Ask the patient if she has an idea about how she might hurt herself\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 27-year-old female is brought to the emergency department by police when she attacked her date outside of a pizza restaurant. The patient refused to explain her behavior to the police. She seemed to be responding to internal stimuli when being initially interviewed. The patient has a past medical history of depression, anxiety, and obesity. The patient has a known history of medication non-compliance. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam the patient is poorly kempt and has an odd body odor. Inspection of her oropharynx reveals multiple ulcers. Cardiac exam is unrevealing with the exception of a friction rub. Since the incident, the patient has calmed down and is currently resting. She is no longer responding to internal stimuli and is more cooperative. Lab values are obtained and are below.\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 135 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 3.9 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 70 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.7 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.0 mg/dL\nMg2+: 1.5 mEq/L\n\nHemoglobin: 10 g/dL\nHematocrit: 35%\nReticulocyte count: 4.9%\nPlatelet count: 275,000/mm^3\nLeukocyte count: 5,500/mm^3\n\nWhich of the following is the next best step in management for this patient's underlying condition?\nOptions:\nA. IM haloperidol\nB. Haloperidol depot\nC. Clozapine\nD. Urine toxicology\nE. ANA and anti-dsDNA levels\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: D, Urine toxicology\n\nExplanation: The patient's presentation with agitation, responding to internal stimuli, and odd behavior suggests a possible psychotic episode. The physical exam findings of multiple ulcers in the oropharynx and a friction rub on cardiac exam are consistent with a diagnosis of phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication. PCP is a dissociative anesthetic that can cause agitation, hallucinations, and violent behavior. The lab values show a mild metabolic acidosis and elevated creatinine, which may be related to PCP toxicity. The next best step in management would be to perform a urine toxicology screen to confirm the presence of PCP or other substances that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.",

His appendix was removed for an abscess 3 days ago. The complete blood count showed leukocytosis. Anaerobic culture of the peritoneal fluid needle aspirate showed a gram-negative pathogen. Which of the following, in addition to polymicrobial infection, is the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. Bacteroides fragilis\nB. Campylobacter jejuni\nC. Clostridium perfringens\nD. Salmonella serotype typhi\nE. Shigella sonnei\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Bacteroides fragilis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as fever, abdominal pain, and rapidly progressive distension of the abdomen, are consistent with peritonitis, an infection of the peritoneum. The anaerobic culture of the peritoneal fluid needle aspirate showing a gram-negative pathogen suggests that the infection is likely caused by an anaerobic gram-negative bacterium. Bacteroides fragilis is a common anaerobic gram-negative bacterium that can cause peritonitis, especially in the setting of a recent abdominal surgery or trauma, such as the patient's recent appendectomy.",

Which of the following is a characteristic of the factor that was most likely provided?\nOptions:\nA. Required for collagen hydroxylation\nB. Required for dehydrogenase enzymes\nC. Required for methionine processing\nD. Required for methylmalonyl-CoA processing\nE. Required for transketolase function\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Required for dehydrogenase enzymes.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and diagnosis of tuberculosis suggest that she was started on isoniazid (INH) therapy. The skin rash, diarrhea, and confusion she experienced two weeks later are likely symptoms of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) deficiency, which is a common side effect of INH therapy. Vitamin B6 is required as a co-factor for various dehydrogenase enzymes, and supplementing with it can help alleviate these symptoms.",

Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - right subclavian vein - systemic circulation\nE. Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Sentinel node - left lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation.\n\nOvarian cancer typically spreads through the lymphatic system, and the most likely route for it to metastasize to the brain would be through the left lymphatic duct, which drains into the left subclavian vein and then into the systemic circulation. From there, the cancer cells can spread to the brain through the bloodstream.",

Which of the following is the best next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Barium swallow\nB. Urgent surgery\nC. Magnetic resonance imaging\nD. Gastrografin swallow\nE. Ultrasound\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Gastrografin swallow\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: An 80-year-old African American man is brought to the emergency department in a confused state with history of general illness for the past week. He is known to be hypertensive, but noncompliant with medications for the last 20 years. Physical examination reveals dry skin, ecchymoses, and conjunctival pallor. His blood pressure is 180/99 mm Hg, heart rate is 89/min, and respiratory rate is 17/min. The initial laboratory results are remarkable for hemoglobin of 10 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 90 \u03bcm3, platelet count of 200,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen of 29 mg/dL, and creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL. Which of the following would be the best initial management for this patient's condition?\nOptions:\nA. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)\nB. Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)\nC. Calcium channel blocker (CCB)\nD. Beta-blocker (BB)\nE. Thiazide\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: C, Calcium channel blocker (CCB)\n\nExplanation: The patient is an 80-year-old African American man with a history of hypertension and noncompliance with medications for 20 years. He presents with confusion, dry skin, ecchymoses, and conjunctival pallor, indicating dehydration and possible end-organ damage. His blood pressure is 180/99 mm Hg, which is severely elevated. The initial laboratory results show anemia, normal platelet count, and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, suggesting kidney damage.\n\nGiven the patient's age, race, and comorbidities, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are a good choice for initial management of hypertension. CCBs are effective in reducing blood pressure and have a relatively low risk of adverse effects, particularly in older adults. They are also a good option for African Americans, who tend to respond better to CCBs than to other classes of antihypertensive medications.\n\nACEIs and ARBs may not be the best initial choice due to the patient's kidney damage and potential risk of worsening renal function. Beta-blockers may not be effective in this patient due to the lack of tachycardia, and thiazide diuretics may exacerbate dehydration.",

Take into account the best medical decision made by the physician for the patient\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Respect the patient\u2019s advance directive orders\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 4-month-old boy is brought to the pediatrician by his parents. He presents to the pediatric ward with fever, dyspnea, and cough, which he developed 3 days ago. His mother also reports he had poor weight gain despite a good appetite during the past 2 months as well as frequent stools with an unpleasant smell. He was born at 29 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is meeting all of his milestones and is up to date with all vaccines. The child is breastfed exclusively. His blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, the heart rate is 109/min, the respiratory rate is 29/min, and the temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.4\u00b0F). The patient\u2019s weight is between the 5th and 10th percentile. His length is between the 50th and 75th percentile. The patient is sluggish and reacts torpidly to examination. His skin is pale and dry with decreased turgor and elasticity. On auscultation, there are diminished vesicular sounds and disseminated moist rales at the bases of both lungs. Heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is distended without palpable masses. The patient\u2019s blood analysis shows the following findings:\nComplete blood count \n Erythrocytes  3.3 x 106/mm3\n Hb  12 g/dL\n Total leukocyte count  17,500/mm3\n Neutrophils\n 59%\n Lymphocytes\n 32%\n Eosinophils\n 3%\n Monocytes\n 6%\n Basophils\n 0\nPlatelet count\n232,000/mm3\nSputum culture grows Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A sweat test shows chloride concentration of 85 mEq/L (elevated). Which of the following is involved in the pathogenesis of this patient\u2019s symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Neutrophil elastase damages lung tissue due to lack of alpha-1-antitrypsin.\nB. Abnormal CFTR protein\nC. Eosinophils infiltrate blood vessel walls.\nD. Electron transport chain in mitochondria is disrupted due to lack of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.\nE. Due to mutations in dynein, the ciliary epithelium fails to provide appropriate mucociliary clearance.\n\nResponse: The correct answer is: B. Abnormal CFTR protein\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, cough, poor weight gain, and frequent stools with an unpleasant smell, are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). The sweat test result showing an elevated chloride concentration of 85 mEq/L is a diagnostic indicator of CF. The growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum culture is also consistent with CF, as this bacterium is a common pathogen in CF patients.\n\nThe abnormal CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein is the underlying cause of CF. The CFTR protein is a chloride channel that regulates the transport of salt and water in and out of cells. In CF, the abnormal CFTR protein leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus that clogs the airways and digestive tract, causing the characteristic symptoms of the disease.",

She reports that over the past 2 months, she has felt increasingly tired despite no changes in her diet or exercise. Her past medical history is notable for obesity, seasonal allergies, and hypertension. She takes ranitidine as needed and hydrochlorothiazide daily. Her family history is notable for colorectal cancer in her mother and maternal uncle, endometrial cancer in her maternal aunt, and ovarian cancer in her maternal grandmother. Her temperature is 98.8\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 132/71 mmHg, pulse is 89/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, she has conjunctival pallor. A stool sample is hemoccult positive.

Homologous recombination\nC. Mismatch repair\nD. Non-homologous end joining\nE. Nucleotide excision repair\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Mismatch repair\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: Background and Methods:\nAldosterone is important in the pathophysiology of heart failure. In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had NYHA class III or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35%, and who were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.\nResults:\nThe trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; P<0.001). This 30% reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P<0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients.\nTo which of the following patients are the results of this clinical trial applicable?\nOptions:\nA. An 82-year-old female with NYHA class II heart failure with an LVEF of 22%, taking lisinopril, furosemide, and digoxin\nB. A 65-year-old male with newly diagnosed NYHA class IV heart failure and a LVEF of 21%, about to begin medical therapy\nC.

She tested positive for both Kernig and Brudzinski's signs and shows signs of confusion, dyspnea, and hypotension. The blood culture results confirmed the presence of Neisseria meningitidis, and a complete blood count (CBC) revealed leukocytosis. Which one of the cytokines below takes part in the pathogenesis of septic shock?\nOptions:\nA. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1\nB. Interleukin-5\nC. Interleukin-12\nD. Interferon-\u03b1\nE. Interleukin-4\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1.\n\nTumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) is a cytokine that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of septic shock. It is released by macrophages and other immune cells in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides, such as those found in Neisseria meningitidis. TNF-\u03b1 causes a systemic inflammatory response, leading to vasodilation, increased permeability, and activation of other immune cells, which can ultimately lead to septic shock.\n\nThe other options are not directly involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock:\n\nB. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is involved in the regulation of eosinophil function and is not typically associated with septic shock.\n\nC. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is involved in the regulation of cell-mediated immunity and is not directly involved in septic shock.\n\nD. Interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1) is involved in the regulation of antiviral responses and is not typically associated with septic shock.\n\nE. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is involved in the regulation of Th2 responses and is not directly involved in septic shock.",

The patient\u2019s tongue is bright red with atrophic papillae. The abdomen is distended and tender to palpation in the epigastric area. Neurological examination shows symmetrical bilateral distal hypoesthesia for all sensations and decreased muscle strength in both upper and lower extremities. On a mini-mental status examination, the patient scores 25. The patient\u2019s blood test results are as follows:\nErythrocytes 2.8 x 109/mm3\nHb 8.6 g/dL\nHt 37%\nMean corpuscular hemoglobin  49.9 pg/cell (3.1 fmol/cell)\nMean corpuscular volume 142 \u00b5m3 (142 fL)\nReticulocyte count 0.3%\nTotal leukocyte count 3,070/mm3\nNeutrophils 54%\nLymphocyte 32%\nEosinophil 3%\nMonocyte 11%\nBasophil 0%\nPlatelet count 195,000/mm3\nHbA1C 4.3%\nFasting plasma glucose 4.6 mmol/l (82.9 mg/dL)\nAspartate aminotransferase 22 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase 19 U/L\nAmylase 32 U/L\nTotal bilirubin 32 \u00b5mol/L (1.87 mg/dL)\nConjugated bilirubin 8 \u00b5mol/L (0.4677 mg/L)\nWhich of the following options best explains the patient\u2019s neurological and psychiatric symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Chronic bilirubin toxicity\nB. Chronic hyperglycemia\nC. Chronic acetaldehyde influence\nD. Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids\nE. Influence of pseudo-neurotransmitters\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including tingling and decreased sensation in both lower extremities, somnolence, and forgetfulness, suggest a neurological disorder. The patient's medical history, including acute hepatitis B 20 years ago, and the presence of a bright red tongue with atrophic papillae, suggest a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient's blood test results, including a low hemoglobin level, low mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and a low reticulocyte count, are consistent with a macrocytic anemia, which is often seen in vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\nVitamin B12 plays a crucial role in the methylation of myelin phospholipids, which is necessary for the maintenance of the myelin sheath. Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids can lead to demyelination and neurological symptoms, including numbness, tingling, and weakness in the extremities, as well as cognitive impairment and somnolence.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A 51-year-old man presents to his physician\u2019s office with a persistent fever that started a week ago. He says that his temperature ranges between 37.8\u201339.1\u00b0C (100\u2013102.5\u00b0F). He has also had a persistent cough productive of foul-smelling sputum. There is no significant medical history to report, but he does mention that he has been suffering from dental caries for the last month. He has been meaning to see his dentist but has been too busy to do so. His blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, the respirations are 18/min, and the temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F). His oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. On examination, he has decreased breath sounds in his right lung field with the presence of soft inspiratory crackles. He is sent to the laboratory for sputum analysis and chest imaging. Based on his history and physical examination, which of the following would be the next best step in the management of this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Surgical drainage\nB. Metronidazole\nC. Bronchoscopy\nD. Clindamycin\nE. Hospital admission\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Clindamycin\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 42-year-old man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital because of swelling and redness of the left leg for 3 days. He has chills and malaise. He is treated with intravenous clindamycin for 7 days. On the 8th day at the hospital, he has profuse, foul-smelling, and watery diarrhea. He has nausea and intermittent abdominal cramping. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 110/78 mm Hg. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Abdominal examination shows mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant. Rectal examination shows no abnormalities.

Oral fidaxomicin\nD. Oral rifaximin\nE. Intravenous metronidazole\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Oral fidaxomicin\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 4-year-old boy presents to the ED with a one day history of severe right eye pain accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and headache. He is afebrile and he appears to be alert despite being irritable. Three days ago an ophthalmologist prescribed eye drops for his right eye but his parents do not know the name of the medication. On exam, his right eye is hard to palpation and moderately dilated. His left eye is unremarkable. What is the mechanism of action of the medication that most likely provoked this acute presentation?\nOptions:\nA. Muscarinic antagonist inhibiting pupillary sphincter muscle contraction\nB. Iris neovascularization\nC. M3 agonist causing ciliary muscle contraction\nD. Agonist of prostaglandin F receptor increasing aqueous fluid production\nE. Alpha-adrenergic agonist increasing aqueous fluid production\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Muscarinic antagonist inhibiting pupillary sphincter muscle contraction\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A four-day-old neonate is brought to the pediatrician with vaginal discharge for the last two days. Her mother is concerned about the blood-tinged discharge but states that her daughter has been feeding and voiding well. The neonate was delivered at 39 weeks gestation by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, and she and her mother were discharged home after two days. The prenatal course was complicated by chlamydia in the mother during the first trimester, for which she and the partner were both treated with a negative test of cure. The neonate\u2019s biological father is no longer involved the patient's care, but her mother\u2019s boyfriend has been caring for the baby whenever the mother rests. At this visit, the neonate\u2019s temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), pulse is 138/min, and respirations are 51/min. She appears comfortable, and cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. There are no bruises or marks on her skin. Examination of the genitals reveals no vulvar irritation or skin changes, but there is scant pink mucoid discharge at the introitus. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Vaginal exam under anesthesia\nB. Report to child protective services\nC. Vaginal culture\nD. Warm water irrigation of the vagina\nE. Reassurance\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: E, Reassurance\n\nExplanation: The symptoms described in the question, such as vaginal discharge, are normal in newborns and are caused by the withdrawal of maternal hormones after birth. The discharge is usually clear or white, but it can be blood-tinged due to the hormonal changes. The fact that the neonate is feeding and voiding well, and has a normal physical examination, suggests that there is no underlying infection or other serious condition. Therefore, the best next step in management is to reassure the mother that the symptoms are normal and do not require any further intervention.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A young woman from the Ohio River Valley in the United States currently on corticosteroid therapy for ulcerative colitis presented to a clinic complaining of fever, sweat, headache, nonproductive cough, malaise, and general weakness. A chest radiograph revealed patchy pneumonia in the lower lung fields, together with enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Skin changes suggestive of erythema nodosum (i.e. an acute erythematous eruption) were noted. Because the patient was from a region endemic for fungal infections associated with her symptoms and the patient was in close contact with a person presenting similar symptoms, the attending physician suspected that systemic fungal infection might be responsible for this woman\u2019s illness. Which of the following laboratory tests can the physician use to ensure early detection of the disease, and also effectively monitor the treatment response?\nOptions:\nA. Culture method\nB. Antibody testing\nC. Fungal staining\nD. Antigen detection\nE. Skin tests\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Antigen detection\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 61-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 1 week after undergoing right-sided radical mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer. She says that she has been unable to comb her hair with her right hand since the surgery. Physical examination shows shoulder asymmetry. She is unable to abduct her right arm above 90 degrees. When she pushes against a wall, there is protrusion of the medial aspect of the right scapula. Injury to which of the following nerves is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?\nOptions:\nA. Upper trunk of the brachial plexus\nB. Axillary nerve\nC. Long thoracic nerve\nD. Suprascapular nerve\nE. Thoracodorsal nerve\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Long thoracic nerve\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A scientist is studying the process by which innate immune cells are able to respond to damage and pathogen infiltration. Specifically, she examines patients with an immunodeficiency where they are unable to respond to local infections. She notices that these patients do not produce pustulant fluid and do not have recruitment of immune cells in the first several hours of inflammation. Examining neutrophils within these patients reveals that they are able to slow their movement in a flow chamber by loosely attaching to purified vessel tissues. Subsequently, she shows that the neutrophils attach tightly to these vessel walls and move across the walls to the other side. Finally, when different levels of pathogenic proteins are placed on two sides of a purified vessel wall, the neutrophils from this patient do not exhibit a preference between the two sides. The step of neutrophil recruitment that is most likely defective in this patient involves which of the following mediators?\nOptions:\nA. C5a\nB. Integrins\nC. ICAM proteins\nD. Nitric oxide\nE. Selectins\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, C5a\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 53-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of fatigue and joint and muscle pain. He reports a 6-month history of slowly progressive tiredness associated with dull achy pain in his knees, hips, and shoulders. His past medical history is notable for hypertension, diabetes, and stable angina. He takes lisinopril, metformin, glyburide, and aspirin. He has a history of intravenous drug use and was homeless in his early 30\u2019s. He drinks alcohol socially and has a 30 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination reveals a generally well-appearing male without evidence of ascites, peripheral edema, or jaundice. Results from laboratory tests are below:\n\nHepatitis A IgM: Negative\nHepatitis A IgG: Negative\nHepatitis B surface antigen: Negative\nHepatitis B E antigen: Negative\nHepatitis B core antigen: Negative\nHepatitis B surface IgG: Positive\nHepatitis B E IgG: Negative\nHepatitis B core IgG: Negative\nHepatitis C IgG: Positive\nHCV RNA: 100,000,000 IU/ml\n\nThis patient should be started on which of the following medications?\nOptions:\nA. Sofosbuvir and simeprevir\nB. Interferon-alpha\nC. Interferon-gamma\nD. Ribavirin\nE. Lamivudine\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Sofosbuvir and simeprevir.\n\nThe patient's laboratory results indicate that he has chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, as evidenced by the presence of HCV RNA in his blood. The patient's history of intravenous drug use and homelessness in his early 30s suggests that he may have acquired the infection through shared needles or other high-risk behaviors.\n\nSofosbuvir and simeprevir are direct-acting antiviral agents that are commonly used to treat HCV genotype 1 infection, which is the most common genotype in the United States. This combination therapy has been shown to be highly effective in achieving sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients with chronic HCV infection.\n\nInterferon-alpha (option B) is an older treatment for HCV that is no longer commonly used due to its side effects and lower efficacy compared to direct-acting antiviral agents. Interferon-gamma (option C) is not a treatment for HCV. Ribavirin (option D) is a medication that is sometimes used in combination with interferon-alpha or direct-acting antiviral agents to treat HCV, but it is not typically used as monotherapy. Lamivudine (option E) is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV infection, not HCV.",

Bone marrow failure\nC. Chronic blood loss\nD. Iatrogenesis\nE. Nutritional deficiency\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Autoimmune attack on endocrine tissue\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 40-year-old woman presents to her family physician with a 3-week history of swollen neck. The small, round, and painless swelling, which was detected 3 weeks ago in the middle of her neck, has now increased in size. The swelling is associated with sweaty palms and soles, insomnia, irritability, nervousness, and fatigue; however, the patient does not complain of fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, weight loss, vision problems, or body swelling. The patient\u2019s medical history is negative for similar symptoms or a thyroid disorder. The vital signs are within normal limits. Local examination reveals a 3 x 3 cm round, non-tender, non-fluctuant, and non-pulsatile swelling in the anterior triangle of her neck. The patient carries a total white blood cell count of 10,200/mm3, including 70% neutrophils, 30% lymphocytes, and zero eosinophils.The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 20 mm/hr (normal, 0\u201329 mm/hr). What is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Graves' disease\nB. De Quervain\u2019s thyroiditis\nC. Silent thyroiditis\nD. Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis\nE. Riedel's thyroiditis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis.\n\nHashimoto's thyroiditis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the thyroid gland, leading to hypothyroidism. The patient's symptoms, such as a painless swelling in the neck, sweaty palms and soles, insomnia, irritability, nervousness, and fatigue, are consistent with hypothyroidism. The physical examination finding of a non-tender, non-fluctuant, and non-pulsatile swelling in the anterior triangle of the neck also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the laboratory results, including a normal white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are consistent with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",

Anti-centromere antibodies\nB. Anti-Ro antibodies\nC. Anti-histone antibodies\nD. Voltage-gated calcium channel antibodies\nE. Anti-Jo-1 antibodies\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Anti-Jo-1 antibodies\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: An academic medical center in the United States is approached by a pharmaceutical company to run a small clinical trial to test the effectiveness of its new drug, compound X. The company wants to know if the measured hemoglobin a1c (Hba1c) of patients with type 2 diabetes receiving metformin and compound X would be lower than that of control subjects receiving only metformin. After a year of study and data analysis, researchers conclude that the control and treatment groups did not differ significantly in their Hba1c levels.\n\nHowever, parallel clinical trials in several other countries found that compound X led to a significant decrease in Hba1c. Interested in the discrepancy between these findings, the company funded a larger study in the United States, which confirmed that compound X decreased Hba1c levels. After compound X was approved by the FDA, and after several years of use in the general population, outcomes data confirmed that it effectively lowered Hba1c levels and increased overall survival. What term best describes the discrepant findings in the initial clinical trial run by institution A?\nOptions:\nA. Type I error\nB. Type II error\nC. Hawthorne effect\nD. Confirmation bias\nE. Publication bias\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Type II error\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 17-year-old male presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient was an unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. He has a past medical history of asthma, depression, and anxiety. He is not currently taking any medications. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. The patient is breathing on his own and has strong distal pulses. Ultimately, the patient is discharged with follow up instructions after no significant fractures or injuries are found. The patient then presents 4 months later to his primary doctor with weakness. The patient's strength in his upper extremities is 1/5. He has reduced sensation in his upper extremities as well. The patient's lower extremities reveal 5/5 strength with intact sensation. A chest radiograph and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Cervical spine fracture\nB. Intracranial hemorrhage\nC. Syringomyelia\nD. Brachial plexopathy\nE. Conversion disorder\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Brachial plexopathy.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of weakness and reduced sensation in the upper extremities, with normal strength and sensation in the lower extremities, suggest a peripheral nerve injury. The fact that the patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident 4 months prior and was unrestrained suggests that the injury may have occurred during the accident. Brachial plexopathy, also known as brachial plexus injury, is a common injury that occurs when the nerves in the neck and shoulder area are stretched or torn, often as a result of trauma such as a car accident. This injury can cause weakness, numbness, and tingling in the arm and hand.",

She is in good health and has no complaints. Past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. She recently started metformin and is tolerating the mild side effects, but her fasting blood glucose levels range from 160\u2013190 mg/dL. Today, her blood pressure is 125/82 mm Hg, the heart rate is 90/min, the respiratory rate is 17/min, and the temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical exam, she appears well developed and obese. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her fasting glucose level is 175 mg/dL and her A1c is 7.1%. Her physician decides to add canagliflozin to her current treatment regimen. Which of the following should be evaluated before starting this medication?\nOptions:\nA. \u03b3-glutamyltransferase\nB. \u03b2-hCG levels\nC. Alanine aminotransferase\nD. Serum creatinine\nE. Atrial natriuretic peptide\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Serum creatinine\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 42-year-old female complains of feeling anxious and worrying about nearly every aspect of her daily life. She cannot identify a specific cause for these symptoms and admits that this tension is accompanied by tiredness and difficulty falling asleep. To treat this problem, the patient is prescribed sertraline. She endorses a mild improvement with this medication, and over the next several months, her dose is increased to the maximum allowed dose with modest improvement. Her psychiatrist adds an adjunctive treatment, a medication which notably lacks any anticonvulsant or muscle relaxant properties. This drug most likely acts at which of the following receptors?\nOptions:\nA. GABA receptor\nB. Alpha adrenergic receptor\nC. Glycine receptor\nD. 5HT-1A receptor\nE. Beta adrenergic receptor\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, 5HT-1A receptor\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: Background: Aldosterone blockade reduces mortality and morbidity among patients with severe heart failure. Researchers conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.\nMethods: Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.\nResults: During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group (14.4%) and 554 deaths in the placebo group (16.7%, p = 0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; p = 0.005). The rate of the other primary endpoints, death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for cardiovascular events, was reduced by eplerenone (relative risk, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; p = 0.002), as was the secondary endpoint of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; p = 0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; p = 0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5 percent in the eplerenone group and 3.9 percent in the placebo group (p = 0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4 percent in the eplerenone group and 13.1 percent in the placebo group (p < 0.001).\nWhich of the following represents the number of patients needed to treat to save one life, based on the primary endpoint?\nOptions:\nA. 1/(0.144 - 0.167)\nB. 1/(0.136 - 0.118)\nC. 1/(0.300 - 0.267)\nD. 1/(0.167 - 0.144)\nE. 1/(0.267 - 0.300)\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, 1/(0.167 - 0.144)\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 32-year-old male presents to the emergency department because of fever and diarrhea. He was in his normal state of health until 2 weeks ago when he went abroad on a vacation. During his trip he went kayaking, visited spas, interacted with local animals, and ate local foods. Since returning he has had 3-day history of fever, cough, headache, and diarrhea. He drinks socially and has a 15-pack-year history of smoking. On presentation his temperature is 102.3\u00b0F (39.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 105/62 mmHg, pulse is 91/min, respirations are 18/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Chest exam reveals fine crackles on auscultation. Chest radiograph reveals patchy infiltrates in both lungs and labs reveal mild hyponatremia and mild elevation of AST/ALT levels. The organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following characteristics?\nOptions:\nA. Can form an endospore\nB. Has a rabbit reservoir\nC. Has no cell wall\nD. Is more common in parrot owners\nE. Is transmitted by air conditioning\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: B. Has a rabbit reservoir\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as fever, cough, headache, and diarrhea, along with the chest radiograph findings of patchy infiltrates in both lungs, suggest a diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease.

Scaly and flaky eruptions are also present on his ears, eyebrows, and scalp. He describes the lesions as being itchy and irritating. When the scales are scraped away, pinpoint bleeding is noted. His vital signs are unremarkable, and physical examination is otherwise within normal limits. Which of the following is the best initial test for this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. Skin biopsy\nB. Serum autoantibodies\nC. Plain film X-rays of the hands and feet\nD. No tests are necessary\nE. Wood\u2019s lamp\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, No tests are necessary\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 27-year-old man with a history of cocaine abuse comes to the physician 2 weeks after undergoing successful arthroscopic repair of a torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee. There were no complications. He was discharged with prescriptions for oxycodone and acetaminophen. He complains of severe pain that prevents him from participating in physical therapy and wakes him from sleep. Physical examination of the left knee shows a healing incision; there is no joint effusion, erythema, or evidence of wound dehiscence, and his gait is normal. When the physician recommends switching to ibuprofen for pain, he becomes visibly angry and demands a refill of oxycodone. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient's request?\nOptions:\nA. Prescribe a long-acting opioid for better pain relief if he is willing to sign a pain contract\nB. Request further information about which drugs he has taken recently and in the past\nC. Request consent for urine test to assess current drug use\nD. Prescribe a short course of oxycodone and schedule a follow-up appointment in one week\nE. Refer to a substance use counselor for addiction counseling\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Request consent for urine test to assess current drug use.\n\nThe patient's behavior, such as becoming visibly angry and demanding a refill of oxycodone, suggests that he may be experiencing opioid withdrawal or craving, which is a common symptom of opioid use disorder. Given his history of cocaine abuse, it is essential to assess his current drug use and potential misuse of prescription opioids. Requesting consent for a urine test is a reasonable step to take before making any decisions about prescribing further opioids.",

Three months ago, she presented with complaints about facial asymmetry. Her daughter has noticed that her mother\u2019s mouth is droops downwards on the right side of her face and that she cannot close her right eye well. The same side also lacks wrinkles on the forehead. Since then, the patient feels like her facial muscles have gotten weaker. She was given a course of corticosteroids, but she has still not recovered fully. Upon being asked to close her eyes, the patient has difficulty doing so and fails to completely close her eyelids. On examination, there is no loss of pain, temperature, or crude or tactile touch sensations in the whole face. The neurological exam is otherwise unremarkable. This patient also has type 2 diabetes mellitus which is well controlled with metformin. The neurologist recommends a therapy that will help relieve her symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely treatment option being prescribed to this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Botox\nB. Carbamazepine\nC. Vitamin B12\nD. Methylprednisolone\nE. Ceftriaxone\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Botox.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including facial asymmetry, drooping of the mouth, and inability to close the right eye, suggest a diagnosis of Bell's palsy, a condition that affects the facial nerve. The patient's lack of recovery with corticosteroids and the persistence of symptoms suggest that additional treatment is needed. Botox (botulinum toxin) is often used to treat facial asymmetry and weakness associated with Bell's palsy. It can help relax the affected muscles and improve facial symmetry.",

He is a financial director with a 15-pack-year history of smoking who tried quitting several times. He tried different nicotine replacement products, none of which helped him. The patient has gastrointestinal reflux disease and takes omeprazole. The medical history is significant for a head trauma after which he had two seizure episodes. He does not have a history of any other disorders. Currently, he is not on any antiepileptic medication. He heard from his friend about an antidepressant that efficiently helps with smoking cessation. He would like to try this medication, and asks his physician for an advice. Which of the following statements regarding the use of the mentioned medication is correct?\nOptions:\nA. Omeprazole interferes with bupropion metabolism and should be taken one hour prior to omeprazole consumption.\nB. Bupropion is only effective when used together with nicotine replacement products.\nC. Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and it should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder.\nD. The physician may prescribe bupropion for this patient only after a full cardiac workup is performed.\nE. This patient has no contraindications for bupropion and may safely use it.\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: C. Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and it should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder.\n\nExplanation: Bupropion is an antidepressant that is also used to help people quit smoking. However, it is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizure disorder, as it can lower the seizure threshold. Therefore, it is not suitable for this patient who has a history of head trauma and seizure episodes.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A 19-year-old man with a history of type 1 diabetes presents to the emergency department for the evaluation of a blood glucose level of 492 mg/dL. Laboratory examination revealed a serum bicarbonate level of 13 mEq/L, serum sodium level of 122 mEq/L, and ketonuria. Arterial blood gas demonstrated a pH of 6.9. He is admitted to the hospital and given bicarbonate and then started on an insulin drip and intravenous fluid. Seven hours later when his nurse is making rounds, he is confused and complaining of a severe headache. Repeat sodium levels are unchanged, although his glucose level has improved. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.6\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), pulse 50/min, respiratory rate 13/min and irregular, and blood pressure 177/95 mm Hg.

He denies any substance abuse or major changes in his sleep schedule. He reports frequently dozing off during his regular daily activities. On further review of systems, he endorses falling asleep frequently with the uncomfortable sensation that there is someone in the room, even though he is alone. He also describes that from time to time, he has transient episodes of slurred speech when experiencing heartfelt laughter. Vital signs are stable, and his physical exam is unremarkable. This patient is likely deficient in a neurotransmitter produced in which part of the brain?\nOptions:\nA. Thalamus\nB. Pons nucleus\nC. Hippocampus\nD. Hypothalamus\nE. Midbrain\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Hypothalamus\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 25-year-old man comes to the physician for a 2-month history of abdominal discomfort, fatigue, and increased urinary frequency, especially at night. He has also noticed that despite eating more often he has lost 14-lbs (6-kg). He has a congenital solitary kidney and a history of Hashimoto thyroiditis, for which he takes levothyroxine. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 10 years. BMI is 18 kg/m2. His temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination is unremarkable. Serum studies show an osmolality of 305 mOsm/L and bicarbonate of 17 mEq/L. Urinalysis shows clear-colored urine with no organisms. Which of the following is most likely to be helpful in establishing the diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland\nB. Serum glucose\nC. Water deprivation test\nD. Serum creatinine\nE. Digital rectal examination\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Serum glucose\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 23-year-old man comes to the clinic for yellowing of his eyes. The patient has been relatively healthy and just recently started \u201cintermittent fasting\u201d to try to lose weight. He recalls a similar episode 4 years ago when he was recovering from an emergency appendectomy. The patient denies smoking but endorses an episode of binge drinking 2 days ago. He is sexually active with both men and women. His physical examination is unremarkable besides scleral icterus. What is the most likely explanation for this patient\u2019s symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of biliary tract\nB. Chronic viral infection of the liver\nC. Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase\nD. Defective bilirubin excretion\nE. Macrovesicular steatosis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase.\n\nThis patient's symptoms, particularly the yellowing of the eyes (scleral icterus), suggest jaundice, which can be caused by Gilbert's syndrome. Gilbert's syndrome is a benign condition characterized by decreased activity of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, which is involved in bilirubin metabolism. This leads to increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood, causing jaundice.\n\nThe patient's history of a similar episode 4 years ago after an appendectomy and the recent episode after binge drinking suggest that the condition may be triggered by stress or fasting, which is consistent with Gilbert's syndrome.",

Fomepizole\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Fomepizole\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: Ten days after undergoing a cadaveric renal transplant, a 21-year-old man has pain in the right lower abdomen and generalized fatigue. During the past 2 days, he has had decreasing urinary output. He passed 5 liters of urine on the second postoperative day and serum studies showed a creatinine concentration of 2.1 mg/dL. He has adult polycystic kidney disease and was on maintenance hemodialysis for 2 months prior to transplantation. Current medications include azathioprine, cyclosporine, prednisone, and enalapril. He appears lethargic. His temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 164/94 mm Hg. Examination shows a healing surgical incision in the right lower abdomen. The graft site shows tenderness to palpation. His blood urea nitrogen concentration is 52 mg/dL, creatinine concentration is 4.1 mg/dL. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows tubulitis. C4d staining is negative. Which of the following is the most likely responsible for this patient's findings?\nOptions:\nA. Recipient T-cells in the graft\nB. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity\nC. Fibrosis of the glomerular vessels\nD. Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy\nE. Newly formed anti-HLA antibodies\n\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Recipient T-cells in the graft.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as pain in the right lower abdomen, generalized fatigue, and decreasing urinary output, are consistent with acute rejection of the transplanted kidney. The biopsy results showing tubulitis support this diagnosis. The absence of C4d staining suggests that the rejection is not antibody-mediated, but rather T-cell mediated. Therefore, the most likely responsible factor for this patient's findings is the recipient's T-cells in the graft, which are attacking the transplanted kidney.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question. A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A gastroenterology fellow is interested in the relationship between smoking and incidence of Barrett esophagus. At a departmental grand rounds she recently attended, one of the presenters claimed that smokers are only at increased risk for Barrett esophagus in the presence of acid reflux. She decides to design a retrospective cohort study to investigate the association between smoking and Barrett esophagus. After comparing 400 smokers to 400 non-smokers identified via chart review, she finds that smokers were at increased risk of Barrett esophagus at the end of a 10-year follow-up period (RR = 1.82, p < 0.001). Among patients with a history of acid reflux, there was no relationship between smoking and Barrett esophagus (p = 0.52). Likewise, no relationship was found between smoking and Barrett esophagus among patients without a history of acid reflux (p = 0.48). The results of this study are best explained by which of the following?\nOptions:\nA. Random error\nB. Effect modification\nC. Confounding\nD. Stratification\nE. Matching\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Confounding\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 25-year-old woman presents to the ED with a diffuse, erythematous rash in the setting of nausea, vomiting, and fever for 2 days. Physical exam reveals a soaked tampon in her vagina. Blood cultures are negative. The likely cause of this patient's disease binds to which molecule on T cells?\nOptions:\nA. CD3\nB. Gamma chain of the IL-2 receptor\nC. CD40 ligand\nD. Variable beta portion of the T-cell receptor\nE. Fas ligand\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Variable beta portion of the T-cell receptor\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A randomized controlled trial was initiated to evaluate a novel DPP-4 inhibitor for blood glucose management in diabetic patients. The study used a commonly prescribed sulfonylurea as the standard of care treatment. 2,000 patients were enrolled in the study with 1,000 patients in each arm. One of the primary outcomes was the development of diabetic nephropathy during treatment. This outcome occurred in 68 patients on the DPP-4 inhibitor and 134 patients on the sulfonylurea. What is the relative risk reduction (RRR) for patients using the DPP-4 inhibitor compared with the sulfonylurea?\nOptions:\nA. 23%\nB. 33%\nC. 43%\nD. 49%\nE. 59%\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, 49%\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 58-year-old woman presents to the office for routine follow-up. She recently underwent routine screening for bone density due to a history of hypothyroidism. She also has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that is being treated with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) and more recently with a histamine2 receptor antagonist (H2RA), hypertension being treated with a thiazide diuretic, depression being treated with lithium, and hormone replacement therapy. Her results meet the criteria for osteopenia, with a T-score of -1.6. She is concerned about progressive bone loss and the risk of fractures. Which of the following medication classes should be discontinued?\nOptions:\nA. Proton-pump inhibitors\nB. Thiazide diuretics\nC. Histamine2 receptor antagonists\nD. Lithium\nE. Estrogen\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Proton-pump inhibitors.\n\nProton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) can interfere with calcium absorption, which can contribute to bone loss and increase the risk of fractures. Discontinuing PPIs may help to reduce this risk. The other options are not directly related to bone loss or osteopenia:\n\n* Thiazide diuretics can actually help to reduce the excretion of calcium in the urine, which can be beneficial for bone health.\n* Histamine2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) are not known to have a significant impact on bone health.\n* Lithium is not typically associated with bone loss or osteopenia.\n* Estrogen, as part of hormone replacement therapy, may actually help to maintain bone density in postmenopausal women.",

She mentions that she needs to drink water frequently and often feels that her mouth and throat are dry. On physical examination, she has bilateral enlargement of the parotid glands and dry conjunctivae. Her physical examination and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of sicca syndrome. In addition to non-pharmacological measures, a drug is prescribed to improve symptoms related to dryness of mouth by increasing salivation. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the drug that most likely is being prescribed to this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Selective M3 muscarinic receptor antagonist\nB. Selective M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist\nC. Selective M2 muscarinic receptor agonist\nD. Selective M2 muscarinic receptor antagonist\nE. Selective M3 muscarinic receptor agonist\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Selective M3 muscarinic receptor agonist\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 13-year-old boy re-presents to his pediatrician with a new onset rash that began a few days after his initial visit. He initially presented with complaints of sore throat but was found to have a negative strep test. His mother demanded that he be placed on antibiotics, but this was refused by his pediatrician. The boy's father, a neurologist, therefore, started him on penicillin. Shortly after starting the drug, the boy developed a fever and a rash. The patient is admitted and his symptoms worsen. His skin begins to slough off, and the rash covers over 30% of his body. His oropharynx and corneal membranes are also affected. You examine him at the bedside and note a positive Nikolsky's sign.

Pemphigus Vulgaris\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 53-year-old male presents to your office for abdominal discomfort. The patient states he first noticed pain on his right flank several months ago, and it has been gradually getting worse. For the past week, he has also noticed blood in his urine. Prior to this episode, he has been healthy and does not take any medications. The patient denies fever, chills, and dysuria. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history. Vital signs are T 37 C, HR 140/90 mmHg, HR 84/min, RR 14/min, O2 98%. Physical exam is unremarkable. CBC reveals a hemoglobin of 17 and hematocrit of 51%, and urinalysis is positive for red blood cells, negative for leukocytes. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Renal cell carcinoma\nB. Polycystic kidney disease\nC. Abdominal aortic aneurysm\nD. Pyelonephritis\nE. Renal oncocytoma\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Renal cell carcinoma\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after being involved in a motor vehicle collision where he was the unrestrained driver. On arrival, he is unconscious. His respirations are 24/min, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg, and pulse is 141/min and irregularly irregular. Examination shows multiple ecchymoses over the chest. There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) laceration over the abdomen and a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over the scalp. Jugular venous pressure is increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft. Two large bore intravenous catheters are inserted and 0.9% saline infusion is begun. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) is negative. An electrocardiogram shows absent p-waves. After 5 minutes, his pulse is 160/min and palpable systolic blood pressure is 50 mm Hg. Vasopressors are administered. One hour later, the patient dies. Which of the following was the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Cardiac contusion\nB. Hemothorax\nC. Aortic dissection\nD. Pulmonary contusion\nE. Cardiac tamponade\n\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Cardiac tamponade.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and signs, such as jugular venous pressure, bilateral crackles at the lung bases, and absent p-waves on the electrocardiogram, are consistent with cardiac tamponade. The patient's rapid deterioration and death despite vasopressor administration also support this diagnosis. Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition that occurs when blood accumulates in the pericardial space, compressing the heart and preventing it from pumping effectively. It is a common complication of chest trauma, such as that sustained in a motor vehicle collision.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A 37-year-old G1P1001 presents for her 6-week postpartum visit after delivering a male infant by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 41 weeks and 5 days gestation. She notes that five days ago, her right breast began to hurt, and the skin near her nipple turned red. She also states that she has felt feverish and generally achy for 2 days but thought she was just sleep deprived. The patient\u2019s son has been having difficulty latching for the last 2 weeks and has begun receiving formula in addition to breast milk, though the patient wishes to continue breastfeeding. She is generally healthy with no past medical history but has smoked half a pack per day for the last 15 years. Her mother died from breast cancer at the age of 62, and her father has hypertension and coronary artery disease. At this visit, her temperature is 100.6\u00b0 F (38.1\u00b0 C), blood pressure is 116/73 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 14/min. She appears tired and has a slightly flat affect. Examination reveals a 4x4 cm area of erythema on the lateral aspect near the nipple on the right breast. In the center of this area, there is a fluctuant, tender mass that measures 2x2 cm. The overlying skin is intact. The remainder of her exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Mammogram\nB. Incision and drainage\nC. Cessation of breastfeeding\nD. Needle aspiration and oral dicloxacillin\nE. Cessation of smoking\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Needle aspiration and oral dicloxacillin\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room 30 minutes after being hit in the face with a baseball at high velocity. Examination shows left periorbital swelling, posterior displacement of the left globe, and tenderness to palpation over the left infraorbital rim. There is limited left upward gaze and normal horizontal eye movement. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following as a result of this patient's trauma?\nOptions:\nA. Injury to lacrimal duct system\nB. Clouding of maxillary sinus\nC. Pneumatization of frontal sinus\nD. Cerebrospinal fluid leak\nE. Disruption of medial canthal ligament\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Clouding of maxillary sinus\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 40-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain for the last 3 hours. His ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF and reciprocal segment depression in leads V1\u2013V6. On physical examination, cardiac sounds are normal on auscultation. His blood pressure is 92/64 mm Hg and heart rate was 93/min. A tissue plasminogen activator is administered to the patient intravenously within 1 hour of hospital arrival due to a lack of available percutaneous coronary intervention. After 6 hours of therapy, the patient\u2019s clinical condition starts to deteriorate. ECG on the monitor shows accelerated idioventricular rhythm, which within a couple of minutes changes to ventricular fibrillation. Before any measures could be started, the patient deteriorates further and must be transferred to the ICU. What is the most likely etiology of the ECG findings in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Increase in cellular pH\nB. Increased production of superoxide dismutase\nC. Calcium efflux\nD. Inhibition of lipid peroxidation\nE. Free radical formation\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Free radical formation\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 65-year-old man with a longstanding history of poorly-controlled hypertension and no recent illness or cardiac disease presents to clinic complaining of chest pain that is worse on inspiration and relieved by sitting forward. Vital signs are stable. On exam, you detect a friction rub. Routine labs show K 7.5 and Cr 5.1. If this patient's clinical signs and laboratory findings are indicative of a chronic condition, what would be expected on urinary analysis?\nOptions:\nA. Muddy brown granular casts\nB. Red blood cell casts\nC. White blood cell casts\nD. Fatty casts\nE. Broad and waxy casts\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Broad and waxy casts.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, likely due to hypertension. The presence of a friction rub and chest pain that is worse on inspiration and relieved by sitting forward suggests pericarditis, which is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. The elevated potassium and creatinine levels also support this diagnosis.\n\nOn urinary analysis, broad and waxy casts are typically seen in chronic kidney disease, indicating chronic damage to the kidneys and tubulointerstitial scarring.",

The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. He was breastfed for the first 3 months and then switched to cow\u2019s milk and about two months ago she started giving him fruits and vegetables. Family history is noncontributory. Today, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, and temperature of 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On examination, he has a heartbeat with a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Generally, the boy looks pale. His weight and height fall within the expected range. A complete blood count (CBC) shows the following:\nHemoglobin (Hb): 9.1 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV): 65 fL\nTotal iron binding capacity (TIBC): 550 \u03bcg/dL\nSerum iron: 45 \u00b5g/dL\nSerum lead: < 5 \u00b5g/dL\nWhat is the best treatment for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Iron supplementation only\nB. Proper diet and iron supplementation\nC. Multivitamins\nD. Proper diet only\nE. Lead chelation therapy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Proper diet and iron supplementation.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest iron deficiency anemia. The hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL is below normal, and the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 65 fL indicates microcytic anemia, which is consistent with iron deficiency. The total iron binding capacity (TIBC) is elevated, and the serum iron level is low, further supporting the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia.\n\nThe best treatment for this patient is to provide iron supplementation in addition to ensuring a proper diet that is rich in iron. Iron supplementation will help to replenish the patient's iron stores and correct the anemia. A proper diet that includes iron-rich foods such as meat, poultry, fish, and fortified cereals will also help to maintain adequate iron levels.\n\nOption A, iron supplementation only, is not sufficient as the patient also needs a proper diet to maintain adequate iron levels. Option C, multivitamins, may not provide sufficient iron to correct the anemia. Option D, proper diet only, may not be enough to correct the anemia quickly, and iron supplementation is necessary to replenish the patient's iron stores. Option E, lead chelation therapy, is not indicated as the serum lead level is within normal limits.",

Three months later, his blood pressure appears to be adequately controlled on this therapy. While working in his garden one afternoon, the patient is stung by a wasp and experiences a severe anaphylactic reaction that is subsequently treated with epinephrine. Which of the following effects would be expected upon administration of this epinephrine treatment?\nOptions:\nA. Decreased bronchodilation\nB. Increased motility of the gastrointestinal tract\nC. Decreased heart rate\nD. Decreased blood pressure\nE. Increased heart rate\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Decreased bronchodilation.\n\nPropranolol is a non-selective beta blocker, which means it blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. Beta-2 receptors are responsible for bronchodilation, which is the widening of the airways. In an anaphylactic reaction, epinephrine is administered to stimulate beta-2 receptors and cause bronchodilation, which helps to relieve respiratory distress.\n\nHowever, in this patient, the beta blocker propranolol is already blocking beta-2 receptors, which would reduce the effectiveness of epinephrine in causing bronchodilation. Therefore, the administration of epinephrine would be expected to result in decreased bronchodilation.",

A CT scan of the abdomen shows segmental wall thickening of the descending colon with multiple diverticula and a 5.0-cm, low-attenuation pelvic lesion with air-fluid levels. CT-guided drainage of the fluid collection yields 250 mL of yellow-greenish fluid. Release of which of the following substances is most likely responsible for the formation of the drained lesion?\nOptions:\nA. Staphylococcal coagulase\nB. Interferon-gamma\nC. Lipoteichoic acid\nD. Interleukin-3\nE. Lysosomal enzymes\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C, Lipoteichoic acid.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are consistent with diverticulitis, a complication of diverticulosis. The formation of the abscess (the 5.0-cm, low-attenuation pelvic lesion with air-fluid levels) is likely due to the release of lipoteichoic acid, a component of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria, which is a common cause of diverticulitis. Lipoteichoic acid is a potent inducer of inflammation and can lead to the formation of abscesses.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of involuntary loss of urine. She loses small amounts of urine in the absence of an urge to urinate and for no apparent reason. She also reports that she has an intermittent urinary stream. Two years ago, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Current medications include glatiramer acetate and a multivitamin. She works as a librarian. She has 2 children who attend middle school. Vital signs are within normal limits. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Pelvic examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows a slight hypesthesia in the lower left arm and absent abdominal reflex, but otherwise no abnormalities. Her post-void residual urine volume is 131 mL. Bladder size is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's urinary incontinence?\nOptions:\nA. Cognitive impairment\nB. Vesicovaginal fistula\nC. Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia\nD. Bladder outlet obstruction\nE. Impaired detrusor contractility\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 30-year-old man presents with fever, malaise, and severe pain in his right wrist and left knee for the last 2 days. He describes the pain as 8/10 in intensity, sharp in character, and extending from his right wrist to his fingers. He denies any recent inciting trauma or similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is unremarkable. He is sexually active with multiple partners and uses condoms inconsistently. The vital signs include blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg, pulse 100/min, and temperature 38.3\u00b0C (101.0\u00b0F). On physical examination, the right wrist and left knee joints are erythematous, warm, and extremely tender to palpation. Both joints have a significantly restricted range of motion. A petechial rash is noted on the right forearm. An arthrocentesis is performed on the left knee joint. Which of the following would be the most likely finding in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Arthrocentesis aspirate showing gram-positive cocci in clusters\nB. Arthrocentesis aspirate showing minimal, purulent joint effusion with negative culture\nC. Positive serum ASO titer\nD. Radiographs of right wrist and left knee showing osteopenia and joint space narrowing\nE. Arthrocentesis aspirate showing negatively birefringent crystals under polarised light\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Arthrocentesis aspirate showing minimal, purulent joint effusion with negative culture\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 42-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after the sudden onset of severe chest pain, diaphoresis, shortness of breath, and palpitations. His symptoms occurred while he was at a party with friends. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 24 years. He uses cocaine occasionally. The last use was three hours ago. He appears pale. His pulse is 110/min, blood pressure is 178/106 mm Hg, and respirations are 24/min. His pupils are dilated and react sluggishly to light. The lungs are clear to auscultation. An ECG shows tachycardia and ST segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. While recording the ECG, the patient loses consciousness. A photo of the ECG at that point is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Administer lidocaine\nB. Unsynchronized cardioversion\nC. Coronary angiography\nD. Administer epinephrine\nE. Synchronized cardioversion\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Unsynchronized cardioversion\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: Background:\nSome patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.\nMethods:\nIn this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).\nConclusions:\nMepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.\nGiven the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?\nOptions:\nA. A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.\nB. A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.\nC. A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.\nD. A type 1 error is a beta (\u03b2) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.\nE. A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: B. A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.\n\nExplanation: A type 1 error, also known as a false positive, occurs when a study finds a statistically significant difference between groups when, in reality, there is no true difference. This means that the null hypothesis (which states that there is no difference between groups) is actually true, but the study incorrectly rejects it. In the context of this study, if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error, it would mean that mepolizumab does not actually reduce asthma exacerbations or improve markers of asthma control, but the study incorrectly concluded that it does.",

She marries a man (without this disease phenotype) from a population where the prevalence of this disease is 1/100. What is the chance that their child will have the disease of interest?\nOptions:\nA. 9/100\nB. 1/10\nC. 18/100\nD. 81/100\nE. 9/10\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. 1/10.\n\nThe disease described is cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive disorder. The patient is homozygous for the disease-causing mutation (affected). Her husband is not affected, so he is either homozygous for the normal allele or heterozygous (carrier). Since the prevalence of the disease in his population is 1/100, the frequency of the disease-causing allele is approximately 1/10 (square root of 1/100). Therefore, the probability that he is a carrier is 2/10 (2 times the frequency of the disease-causing allele).\n\nThe patient's genotype is aa (homozygous affected), and her husband's genotype is either AA (homozygous normal) or Aa (heterozygous carrier). The possible genotypes of their offspring are:\n\n* If the husband is AA: all offspring will be Aa (heterozygous carriers)\n* If the husband is Aa: offspring will have a 1/2 chance of being Aa (heterozygous carriers) and a 1/2 chance of being aa (homozygous affected)\n\nSince the probability that the husband is a carrier is 2/10, the probability that their child will be affected (aa) is 1/2 \\* 2/10 = 1/10.",

She was diagnosed with hypertension in the past and is now regularly taking antihypertensive medication (amlodipine 10 mg once daily). She has had a diffuse thyroid swelling for the past 4 months. She complains of pain in the long bones of her arms and legs for the past 3 months. She is slightly built, appears thin, and is anxious and apprehensive. Her skin is moist and warm. Her weight is 45 kg (99.2 lb) and height is 146 cm (4 ft 7 in); BMI is 21.12 kg/m2. Her pulse is 116/min, the blood pressure is 196/102 mm Hg, the respiratory rate is 29/min, and the temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F). Diffuse and firm thyromegaly is present. Her upper extremities exhibit fine tremors during an anxiety attack. The laboratory test results reveal elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines. Serum epinephrine, calcitonin, and parathormone levels are also elevated. Hypercalcemia and hyperglycemia are also noted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome\nB. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1\nC. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A\nD. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B\nE. Neurofibromatosis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including headache, palpitations, and episodic diaphoresis, are consistent with pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal gland that produces excess catecholamines. The presence of diffuse thyroid swelling and elevated calcitonin levels suggests medullary thyroid carcinoma. The combination of these two conditions, along with hyperparathyroidism (elevated parathormone levels), is characteristic of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) 2A.",

He noticed the weakness when he started falling far more frequently while running errands. Since then, he has had increasing difficulty with walking and lifting objects. His past medical history is significant only for well-controlled hypertension, but he says that some members of his family have had musculoskeletal problems. His right upper extremity shows forearm atrophy and depressed reflexes while his right lower extremity is hypertonic with a positive Babinski sign. Which of the following is most likely associated with the cause of this patient's symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. HLA-B8 haplotype\nB. HLA-DR2 haplotype\nC. Mutation in SOD1\nD. Mutation in SMN1\nE.

Intubate and admit to intensive care uint\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Give oxygen immediately\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 45-year-old woman presents with sudden-onset dyspnea. Her past medical history is significant for varicose veins in her lower extremities, well-controlled diabetes mellitus type 2, and a 25 pack-year smoking history. The patient currently takes metformin and pioglitazone. Family history is significant for her sister who died at the age of 35 because of a pulmonary embolism. Her temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F), the pulse is 111/min, the respirations are 18/min, and the blood pressure is 130/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is pale and diaphoretic. Cardiac exam is significant for an S3 gallop. There is erythema and swelling over multiple varicose veins in her left leg. Ultrasound of her left leg is positive for a deep vein thrombosis. The patient is admitted, and anticoagulation is started with a vitamin K inhibitor. However, despite these interventions, she dies shortly after admission. Which of the following was the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. Distal peripheral microembolism\nB. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia\nC. Necrotizing fasciitis\nD. Protein S deficiency\nE. Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Distal peripheral microembolism.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as sudden-onset dyspnea, pale and diaphoretic appearance, and S3 gallop on cardiac exam, suggest a pulmonary embolism (PE). The presence of a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her left leg, as confirmed by ultrasound, further supports this diagnosis. The fact that the patient dies shortly after admission despite anticoagulation therapy also points towards a massive PE. Distal peripheral microembolism, which refers to the embolization of small clots from the DVT to the lungs, is a likely etiology of this patient's condition.",

Menses have occurred at 30- to 90-day intervals since menarche at the age of 12 years. Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago. She is sexually active with her husband and they do not use condoms. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 73 kg (161 lb); BMI is 25.3 kg/m2. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows oily skin and severe acne on the face. There is dark hair on the upper lip and around both nipples. Laboratory studies show:\nDehydroepiandrosterone sulfate 6.2 \u03bcg/mL (N=0.5\u20135.4)\nFollicle-stimulating hormone 20 mIU/mL\nLuteinizing hormone 160 mIU/mL\nTestosterone 4.1 nmol/L (N < 3.5)\nA urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following tests is the most appropriate next step in screening for comorbidities in this patient?\"\nOptions:\nA. 17-hydroxyprogesterone and cortisol level measurements\nB. CA-125 level measurement\nC. Blood glucose and cholesterol level measurements\nD. TSH and T4 level measurements\nE. Transvaginal ultrasonography\n\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Blood glucose and cholesterol level measurements.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. The irregular menstrual bleeding, oily skin, acne, and excessive hair growth are all consistent with PCOS. The laboratory results show elevated levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and testosterone, which are also consistent with PCOS.\n\nPCOS is often associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in screening for comorbidities in this patient would be to measure blood glucose and cholesterol levels to assess her risk for these conditions.",

The patient states that he has lived at home with his parents his entire life but recently was able to get a job at a local factory. Ever since the patient has started working, he has had trouble focusing at his job. He is unable to stay focused on any task. His boss often observes him \"daydreaming\" with a blank stare off into space. His boss will have to yell at him to startle him back to work. The patient states that he feels fatigued all the time and sometimes will suddenly fall asleep while operating equipment. He has tried going to bed early for the past month but is unable to fall asleep until two hours prior to his alarm. The patient fears that if this continues he will lose his job. Which of the following is the best initial step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Ethosuximide\nB. Polysomnography\nC. Bright light therapy\nD. Modafinil\nE. Zolpidem\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Bright light therapy\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 3-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents because of a barking cough, a raspy voice, and noisy breathing for the last 3 days. Five days ago, she had a low-grade fever and runny nose. She attends daycare. Her immunizations are up-to-date. Her temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F) and respirations are 33/min. Physical examination shows supraclavicular retractions. There is a high-pitched sound present on inspiration. Examination of the throat shows erythema without exudates. Which of the following is the most likely location of the anatomic narrowing causing this patient's symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Distal trachea\nB. Pharynx\nC. Epiglottis\nD. Subglottic larynx\nE. Bronchioles\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Subglottic larynx\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 49-year-old man comes to the physician because of tender, red nodules that appeared on his chest 3 days ago. Three weeks ago, he had similar symptoms in his right lower limb and another episode in his left foot; both episodes resolved spontaneously. He also has diarrhea and has had a poor appetite for 1 month. He has a history of dry cough and joint pain, for which he takes albuterol and aspirin as needed. He has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 15 years. He does not drink alcohol. Physical examination shows a linear, erythematous lesion on the right anterior chest wall, through which a cord-like structure can be palpated. The lungs are clear to auscultation. The abdomen is soft, nontender, and non-distended. Examination of the legs is normal. An ultrasound of the legs shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis of the underlying condition?\nOptions:\nA. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level\nB. CT scan of the abdomen\nC. X-ray of the chest\nD. Coagulation studies\nE. Ankle brachial index\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, CT scan of the abdomen\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 7 -day-old newborn boy presents to the emergency department with a history of fever, irritability, and generalized erythema. During the first 2 days of clinical manifestations, the parents of the child tried to control the symptoms using acetaminophen; however, the newborn continued to be ill, and blisters were noticeable around the buttocks, hands, and feet. During the physical examination, the vital signs include body temperature 39.0\u00b0C (102.3\u00b0F), heart rate 130/min, and respiratory rate 45/min. Ears, nose, and oral mucosa preserved their integrity, while the skin presents with diffuse blanching erythema and flaccid blisters with a positive Nikolsky\u2019s sign. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Scarlet fever\nB. Scalded skin syndrome\nC. Impetigo\nD. Erysipela\nE. Pyoderma\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Scalded skin syndrome.\n\nScalded skin syndrome, also known as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, is a rare but serious skin infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus. It typically affects newborns and young children, and is characterized by fever, irritability, and a distinctive skin rash with blisters and erosions. The Nikolsky's sign, which is a positive sign in this case, is a characteristic feature of scalded skin syndrome, where gentle pressure on the skin causes the top layer of skin to separate from the underlying layers, leading to blistering and erosion.\n\nThe other options are not as likely:\n\nA. Scarlet fever is a bacterial infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, which typically presents with a characteristic sandpaper-like rash, fever, and sore throat. While it can cause skin lesions, it is not typically associated with blisters and erosions.\n\nC. Impetigo is a bacterial skin infection that can cause blisters and crusts, but it is typically more localized and does not have the same widespread, diffuse erythema and blisters seen in scalded skin syndrome.\n\nD. Erysipela is a bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissues, typically caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. While it can cause skin lesions and fever, it is not typically associated with blisters and erosions.\n\nE. Pyoderma is a general term for a bacterial skin infection, but it is not a specific diagnosis that fits the symptoms described in this case.",

One year ago, she was diagnosed with Cushing disease, which was ultimately treated with bilateral adrenalectomy. Current medications are hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Examination shows generalized hyperpigmentation of the skin and bitemporal visual field defects. Serum studies show an ACTH concentration of 1250 pg/mL (N = 20\u2013100). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Administer bromocriptine\nB. Administer metyrapone\nC. Perform radiotherapy of the pituitary\nD. Reduce dosage of glucocorticoids\nE. Resect small cell lung carcinoma\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Perform radiotherapy of the pituitary\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 50-year-old woman with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) presents to your clinic with complaints of left eye pain and reduced vision. She notes that she was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to presentation when she noticed some mild tenderness around her left eye, unrelieved by any pain relievers. This morning when she woke up she was unable to see out of her left eye and made an appointment to come see you. Other than SLE, her medical history is unremarkable. She has had no additional symptoms other than pain and vision loss. Her vital signs are all within normal limits. On exam, she has no vision in her left eye, but 20/30 visual acuity in her right eye. When you shine a light in her left eye there is no response. What response would you expect when you shine a light in her right eye?\nOptions:\nA. Bilateral mydriasis\nB. Bilateral miosis\nC. Miosis of the right eye only\nD. Miosis of the left eye only\nE. Mydriasis of the left eye\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Bilateral mydriasis.\n\nWhen light is shone into the right eye, the normal pupillary light reflex would cause both pupils to constrict (miosis). However, since the left eye is affected and has no response to light, shining light into the right eye would cause the right pupil to dilate (mydriasis) due to the lack of input from the affected left eye. This would result in bilateral mydriasis.",

Neutrophilic, protein-rich fluid\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Lipid-rich, protein-rich fluid\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 59-year-old man presents to the health clinic for evaluation of severe itching for the past week. The itching is worse at night while lying in bed. The patient has a past medical history of hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and colon cancer. The patient takes rivaroxaban, simvastatin, and aspirin. The patient has a surgical history of colon resection, appendectomy, and tonsillectomy. He drinks a 6-pack of beer almost every night of the week. He smokes 2 packs of cigarettes daily and has been living at a homeless shelter for the past 6 months. Examination of the skin shows small crusted sores and superficial, wavy gray lines along the wrists and interdigital spaces of both hands as seen in the image. Small vesicles are also present along with excoriations. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment option for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Permethrin\nB. Ivermectin\nC. Acyclovir\nD. Penicillin G\nE. Dicloxacillin\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Permethrin\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 35-year-old woman comes to your office with a variety of complaints. As part of her evaluation, she undergoes laboratory testing which reveals the presence of anti-centromere antibodies. All of the following symptoms and signs would be expected to be present EXCEPT:\nOptions:\nA. Pallor, cyanosis, and erythema of the hands\nB. Calcium deposits on digits\nC. Blanching vascular abnormalities\nD. Hypercoagulable state\nE. Heartburn and regurgitation\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Hypercoagulable state\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 24-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with her boyfriend 2 hours after an episode of loss of consciousness. She was seated and was being tattooed on her right upper flank when she became diaphoretic, pale, and passed out. According to her boyfriend, the patient slipped to the floor and her arms and legs moved in a jerky fashion for a few seconds. She regained consciousness within half a minute and was alert and fully oriented immediately. She has no history of serious illness. She works as an event manager and has had more stress than usual due to a recent concert tour. She appears well. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 120/72 mm Hg. Her cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows an incomplete right bundle branch block. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Vasovagal syncope\nB. Orthostatic syncope\nC. Tonic-clonic seizure\nD. Cardiac arrhythmia\nE. Cardiac structural abnormality\n\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Vasovagal syncope.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as becoming diaphoretic, pale, and passing out, are consistent with vasovagal syncope. The fact that she regained consciousness within half a minute and was alert and fully oriented immediately also supports this diagnosis. The episode was likely triggered by the stress of the tattooing procedure, which can cause a vasovagal response. The incomplete right bundle branch block on the ECG is a common incidental finding and is not related to the patient's symptoms.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A 35-year-old man presents to the physician\u2019s clinic due to episodic chest pain over the last couple of months. He is currently pain-free. His chest pain occurs soon after he starts to exercise, and it is rapidly relieved by rest. He recently started training for a marathon after a decade of a fairly sedentary lifestyle. He was a competitive runner during his college years, but he has only had occasional exercise since then. He is concerned that he might be developing some heart disease. He has no prior medical issues and takes no medications. The family history is significant for hypertension and myocardial infarction in his father. His vital signs include: pulse 74/min, respirations 10/min, and blood pressure 120/74 mm Hg. The ECG test is normal. The physician orders an exercise tolerance test that has to be stopped after 5 minutes due to the onset of chest pain. Which of the following contributes most to the decreasing cardiac perfusion in this patient's heart?\nOptions:\nA. Coronary vasoconstriction\nB. Diastolic aortic pressure\nC. Duration of diastole\nD. Force of myocardial contraction\nE. Ventricular blood volume\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Duration of diastole\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 21-year-old nurse starts to feel ill during his evening shift. Earlier this evening, he started his shift in his normal state of health. Past medical history is significant for multiple admissions to the hospital under strange circumstances. One time he presented to the emergency department complaining of severe abdominal pain and gallstones, though no stones were identified and he was discharged after a full workup. Another time he was admitted for recurrent vomiting episodes and he was discharged after an EGD and several rounds of antiemetics. He has also visited an outpatient clinic for back pain and knee pain, though no findings were ever identified. He takes a multivitamin every day. His mother developed breast cancer at 47 and his father is healthy. Today, his blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 105/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, and temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F). On physical exam, he appears thin and anxious. He is diaphoretic with clammy hands. His heart is tachycardic with an irregular rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. A urine toxicology test and EKG are negative. Random blood sugar is 45 mg/dL. The nurse is admitted and treated appropriately. After a thorough review of his medical records, the hospitalist assigned to this patient consults with psychiatry because she is concerned the patient may have factitious disorder. Which of the following would confirm a diagnosis of the factitious disorder in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Increased anion gap\nB. Elevated troponin I and CK-MB levels\nC. Normal c-peptide levels\nD. Increased c-peptide levels\nE. Presence of norepinephrine and vanillylmandelic acid in the urine\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Normal c-peptide levels\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 3-year-old male is brought to the ER with a sore throat and fever. Examination of the pharynx reveals a dark, inflammatory exudate. Cysteine-tellurite agar culture produces black, iridescent colonies. Microscopic features of the causal organism most likely include which of the following?\nOptions:\nA. Serpentine growth patterns\nB. Metachromic granules\nC. Lancet-shape\nD. Long, branching filaments\nE. Kidney-bean shaped rod\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Metachromic granules\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 30-year-old man presents to the emergency room complaining of malaise. Two hours prior to presentation, he developed muscle cramps and nausea. He has had 3 episodes of non-bloody watery stools since his symptoms started. He reports that he has experienced similar symptoms multiple times over the past 5 years since he started working at his local zoo as a reptilian caretaker. His medical history is unremarkable. He takes fish oil and a multivitamin daily. His temperature is 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, he demonstrates sensitivity to bright light. He is tired-appearing but alert and fully oriented. A stool sample and culture demonstrates abundant non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-negative, and H2S-producing gram-negative bacilli. The pathogen responsible for this patient\u2019s condition relies on a virulence factor with which of the following mechanisms of action?\nOptions:\nA. ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2\nB. Binding the Fc region of host immunoglobulins\nC. Blocking antibody attack on the O antigen\nD. Cleaving immunoglobulin A molecules\nE. Cleaving lecithin\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: C, Blocking antibody attack on the O antigen\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms and the characteristics of the bacteria in the stool sample (non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-negative, and H2S-producing gram-negative bacilli) suggest that the pathogen is Salmonella. Salmonella has a virulence factor called lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is a component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. LPS can block antibody attack on the O antigen, making it difficult for the host's immune system to recognize and respond to the infection.",

Sildenafil\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Amlodipine\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 5-year-old girl is brought to a medical office for evaluation of persistent abdominal pain that has worsened over the past 24 hours. The mother states that the girl often has constipation which has worsened over the last 3 days. The mother denies that the girl has had bloody stools. The girl has not had a bowel movement or passed flatulence in 72 hours. She has vomited 3 times since last night and refuses to eat. She has no significant medical history, including no history of surgeries. On exam, there are no abdominal masses; however, the upper abdomen is distended and tympanic. What is the most likely underlying cause of the girl\u2019s symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Volvulus\nB. Malrotation of the gut\nC. Pyloric stenosis\nD. Duodenal atresia\nE. Meckel\u2019s diverticulum\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Malrotation of the gut\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 62-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of difficulties walking for the past year. He has had multiple falls over the past 4 months. Over the past 6 months, he has had progressive urinary urgency and now wears an adult diaper as is not always able to control the urge to void. His appetite has also decreased in this time period. He used to drive, but his wife convinced him to stop after she noticed that he was becoming increasingly inattentive while driving. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Current medications include ramipril and metformin. His temperature is 37.1C (98.8F), pulse is 90/min and blood pressure is 132/88 mm Hg. Examination shows a broad-based gait with slow and short steps. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. On mental status examination, he is oriented to person and place but not to time. Attention and concentration are impaired. He recalls only one of three objects after 5 minutes. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Ventricular shunting\nB. Acetazolamide therapy\nC. Temporal lobectomy\nD. Donepezil therapy\nE. Sertraline therapy\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: A, Ventricular shunting\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms, including difficulties walking, falls, urinary urgency, decreased appetite, and cognitive impairment, are consistent with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). NPH is a condition in which there is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to ventricular enlargement. The symptoms are often referred to as the \"triad\" of NPH: gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment. Ventricular shunting is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms, as it can help to relieve the pressure and improve the symptoms.",

Although she feels generally healthy she has noticed gaining about 9 kg (20 lb) over the last year. She eats a healthy, varied diet and exercises at the gym 4 days a week, including 20 minutes of aerobic exercise. On further questioning, she has also noted fatigue and constipation. She denies shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, or blood in her stool. At the clinic, the vital signs include: pulse 52/min, blood pressure 110/72 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. The physical exam is notable only for slightly dry skin. The complete blood count (CBC) is within normal limits. Which of the following laboratory values is most likely elevated in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Erythropoietin\nB. Glucose\nC. Triiodothyronine (T3)\nD. Thyroxine (T4)\nE. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: E. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms of weight gain, fatigue, and constipation, along with a normal CBC and physical exam, suggest hypothyroidism. The patient's low pulse rate (52/min) also supports this diagnosis. In hypothyroidism, the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is typically elevated as the pituitary gland tries to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones.",
