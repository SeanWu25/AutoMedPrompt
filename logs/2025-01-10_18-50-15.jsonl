LVH is a common complication of long-standing hypertension, as the heart adapts to the increased pressure by thickening the ventricular wall to generate more force to pump blood.

The cardiac changes described\u2014thickening of the left ventricular wall and narrowing of the ventricular chamber\u2014are indeed indicative of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), which is commonly caused by chronic hypertension. The heart's adaptation to sustained high blood pressure results in these structural changes, supporting the conclusion that chronic hypertension is the most likely underlying cause. Your reasoning is logical and aligns well with the pathophysiology of the condition.",

Vitreous hemorrhage can cause sudden vision changes and obscured fundus examination due to blood in the vitreous cavity.
