A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A 24-year-old male graduate student presents to the physician for a 2-month history of persistent thoughts and anxiety that he is going to be harmed by someone on the street. The anxiety worsened after he witnessed a pedestrian being hit by a car 2 weeks ago. He states, \u201cThat was a warning sign.\u201d On his way to school, he now often leaves an hour earlier to take a detour and hide from people that he thinks might hurt him. He is burdened by his coursework and fears that his professors are trying to fail him. He says his friends are concerned about him, but claims they do not understand because they were not present at the accident. The patient has no known history of any psychiatric illnesses. On the mental status exam, he is alert and oriented, and he shows a full range of affect. Thought processes and speech are organized. His memory and attention are within normal limits. He denies auditory, visual, or tactile hallucinations. The results of urine toxicology screening are negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Avoidant personality disorder\nB. Delusional disorder\nC. Generalized anxiety disorder\nD. Schizophreniform disorder\nE. Schizophrenia\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Delusional disorder\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: An 18-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department after losing consciousness. His mother states that he was running with other kids in the park when he suddenly fell down and became unresponsive for less than 1 minute. He has not had any immunizations due to their religious beliefs. The parents report that he plays with other children, but tires easily. He has had difficulty feeding, but there was no follow-up with a pediatrician. The heart rate was 120/min and the oxygen saturation was 91%. The height is in the 40th percentile and the weight is in the 50th percentile. On examination, the boy is crying with perioral cyanosis. The lung sounds are clear. S-1 is normal and there is a single S-2. A grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur is appreciated at the left upper sternal border. When the child squats, the murmur is intensified and the cyanosis improves. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Diazepam\nB. Morphine, oxygen, nitroglycerin, and aspirin\nC. Morphine, oxygen, IV fluids, and beta blockers\nD. Observation and reassurance\nE. Antibiotics and supportive care\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Morphine, oxygen, IV fluids, and beta blockers\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 59-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C infection comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of ankle pain and nonpruritic skin lesions on his legs. He does not recall recent trauma or injury. He has not received treatment for hepatitis. Examination shows diffuse, violaceous lesions on both lower extremities. The lesions are 4\u20137 mm in size, slightly raised, and do not blanch with pressure. These skin lesions are best classified as which of the following?\nOptions:\nA. Hemangioma\nB. Purpura\nC. Petechiae\nD. Ecchymoses\nE. Spider angioma\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Purpura\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 41-year-old man presents to the clinic with the complaints of abdominal discomfort and cramping for the past 4 months. He also mentions that he has grossly bloody stool and most of the time an urge to defecate. He has a history of bulimia with laxative abuse several years ago. He admits having lost about 5 lb in the past month. His temperature is 37\u00b0 C (98.6\u00b0 F), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 77/min, and blood pressure is 105/86 mm Hg. On physical examination, a mild conjunctival pallor is evident, and the rectum is erythematous, indurated, and tender. Colonoscopy demonstrates continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon. What is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Ulcerative colitis\nB. Celiac disease\nC. Irritable bowel syndrome\nD. Crohn\u2019s disease\nE. Laxative abuse\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Ulcerative colitis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of abdominal discomfort, cramping, grossly bloody stool, and urge to defecate are consistent with inflammatory bowel disease. The presence of continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon on colonoscopy further supports this diagnosis. Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that typically affects the rectum and colon, causing symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding. The patient's history of bulimia with laxative abuse may have contributed to the development of ulcerative colitis.",

Dextrose\nD. Normal saline\nE. Cryoprecipitate\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Fresh frozen plasma and platelets\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: The division chief of general internal medicine at an academic medical center is interested in reducing 30-day readmissions for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in elderly patients. Her research team decided to follow 587 patients over the age of 65 who have recently been admitted to the hospital for DKA for a 30-day period. At the end of 30 days, she identified 100 patients who were readmitted to the hospital and examined risk factors associated with readmission. The main results of her study are summarized in the table below.\nRR (95% CI) P-value\nEpisodes of DKA in the past 3 years < 0.001\nNone Reference\n1\u20132\n1.23 (1.04\u20131.36)\n3\u20134 1.48 (1.38\u20131.59)\n5+ 2.20 (1.83\u20132.51)\nWhich of the following aspects of the results would support a causal relationship between a history of DKA and 30-day readmission risk for DKA?\"\nOptions:\nA. Low p-value\nB. Confidence intervals that do not cross 1.0\nC. Case-control study design\nD. High odds ratio\nE. Dose-response relationship\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Dose-response relationship\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 23-year-old male presents to the emergency room following a gunshot wound to the leg. On arrival his temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, pulse is 112/min, respirations are 21/min, and pulse oximetry is 99% on room air. Two large bore IVs are placed and he receives crystalloid fluid replacement followed by 2 units of crossmatched packed red blood cells. Immediately following transfusion, his temperature is 102.2\u00b0F (39\u00b0C), blood pressure is 93/64 mmHg, pulse is 112/min, respirations are 21/min, and pulse oximetry is 99% on room air. There is oozing from his IV sites. You check the records and realize there was a clerical error with the blood bank. What is the mechanism for his current condition?\nOptions:\nA. Preformed antibodies\nB. Deposition of immune complexes\nC. T lymphocyte reaction\nD. IgE mediated reaction\nE. Production of leukotrienes\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Preformed antibodies\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 45-year-old man presents to your office with a 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria), and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation. He has been evaluated by several practitioners, who have all prescribed antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, with no improvement and leading to emotional distress and sleep disturbances. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for a mildly tender prostate, without masses or nodules. There are no testicular masses, hernias, or hemorrhoids. Additionally to this health issue, you have also been following him for recurrent abdominal pain, periods of constipation and diarrhea, and fatigability, with all test results within the normal range thus far. A summary of recent tests is shown in the following table:\nUrine test\nSample White cells Culture\nMid-stream urine Negative Negative\nExpressed prostatic secretion Positive Negative\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Benign prostatic hyperplasia\nB. Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis\nC. Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis\nD. Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli\nE. Interstitial cystitis\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: B, Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms, including pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms, and painful ejaculation, are consistent with chronic prostatitis. The presence of white cells in the expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) without a positive culture suggests a non-bacterial etiology, which is characteristic of chronic non-bacterial prostatitis. The patient's history of recurrent abdominal pain, constipation, and diarrhea, as well as fatigability, may be related to irritable bowel syndrome or other functional gastrointestinal disorders, but are not directly related to the prostatitis.",

The patient's current medications that she can recall include sumatriptan and naproxen. She has been admitted to the hospital several times recently for panic attacks and suicide attempts. Her temperature is 99.2\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 129/65 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient is given dihydroergotamine, IV fluids, and is started on 100% oxygen. Two hours later, the patient demonstrates slurring of her speech. On physical exam there is drooping of the left side of her mouth, and her left upper extremity demonstrates 2/5 strength. A head CT is ordered. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current presentation?\nOptions:\nA. Hemorrhagic stroke\nB. Ischemic stroke secondary to a thrombus\nC. Medication reaction\nD. Psychogenic symptoms\nE. Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including severe headache, slurred speech, and weakness on the left side of her body, are consistent with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The fact that she took two doses of sumatriptan, a medication typically used to treat migraines, and did not experience improvement in her symptoms suggests that this is not a typical migraine headache. The patient's history of panic attacks and suicide attempts does not explain her current neurological symptoms, making option D (Psychogenic symptoms) less likely. The head CT is likely to show evidence of bleeding in the subarachnoid space, which would confirm the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage.",

He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 5 years. He works as an accountant and describes his work as very stressful. Physical examination shows drooping of the left eyelid, tearing of the left eye, and rhinorrhea. The left pupil is 2 mm and the right pupil is 4 mm. There is localized tenderness along the right supraspinatus muscle. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Giant cell arteritis\nB. Medication overuse headache\nC. Cluster headache\nD. Trigeminal neuralgia\nE. Tension headache\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Cluster headache\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient has a past medical history of asthma and cocaine use. His current medications include albuterol and ibuprofen. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 70/35 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On initial trauma evaluation, his airway is intact and he is breathing spontaneously. The patient's dorsalis pedis and radial pulses are palpable bilaterally. His Glasgow Coma Scale is 9. Head to toe examination reveals instability of the pelvis when downwards force is applied. The patient is started on IV fluids and norepinephrine, and a pelvic binder is placed. The patient's vitals are measured again and his temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 100/55 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. A blood transfusion is started, and the patient is given hydromorphone. The patient suddenly becomes short of breath with notable bilateral wheezing with poor air movement. His blood pressure is 60/35 mmHg and pulse is 160/min. The patient is treated appropriately, intubated, stabilized, and transferred to the surgical intensive care unit. Which of the following is most likely to be found in this patient's history?\nOptions:\nA. Hemolytic anemia and ataxia\nB. Gum disease and poor wound healing\nC. Irregularly irregular heart rhythm\nD. Hepatitis C infection\nE. Anti-A, B, or O antibodies in the serum\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: B. Gum disease and poor wound healing\n\nExplanation: The patient's history of cocaine use and asthma, along with the development of bilateral wheezing and shortness of breath after receiving hydromorphone, suggests an allergic reaction to the medication. This is likely due to the patient's history of cocaine use, which can cause sensitization to certain medications, including opioids like hydromorphone. Cocaine use is also associated with poor oral health, including gum disease, and impaired wound healing.",

She denies any previous urinary tract infections (UTIs), but she says that her mother has had frequent UTIs. Her medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cervical cancer, and hypercholesterolemia. She currently smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day, drinks a glass of wine per day, and denies any illicit drug use. Her vital signs include: temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 87/min, and respiratory rate 17/min. On physical examination, her lung sounds are clear. She has a grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur heard best over the left upper sternal border. She also has tenderness in the suprapubic area. A urinalysis shows the presence of numerous leukocytes, leukocyte esterase, and nitrites. Which of the following factors would not classify a UTI as complicated?\nOptions:\nA. The patient has diabetes\nB. The causative organism is Candida albicans\nC. The causative organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa\nD. The patient has an indwelling catheter\nE.

The associated p-value is 0.03. Which of the following statements is the best interpretation of the reported association in the context of the study?\nOptions:\nA. The 99% confidence interval includes the null hypothesis.\nB. The chance of bias in favor of the alternative hypothesis is 3%.\nC. The p-value represents the likelihood of seeing an increased risk of placenta accreta in women with prior cesarian birth, assuming the alternative hypothesis is true.\nD. There is a 23% probability of seeing the reported risk by chance alone.\nE. The p-value represents the likelihood that the alternative hypothesis is false.\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: B. The chance of bias in favor of the alternative hypothesis is 3%.\n\nExplanation: The p-value of 0.03 indicates that there is a 3% chance of observing the reported association (or a more extreme association) between prior cesarian birth and placenta accreta if there is no real association between the two variables (i.e., the null hypothesis is true). This means that the observed association is statistically significant, and it is unlikely to be due to chance alone.",

What is the signaling mechanism associated with this medication?\nOptions:\nA. Increased permeability of the cell membrane to positively charged molecules\nB. Increased permeability of the cell membrane to negatively charged molecules\nC. Activation of tyrosine kinase\nD. Increased concentration intracellular cAMP\nE. Rapid and direct upregulation of enzyme transcription\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Activation of tyrosine kinase\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: Five days after admission into the ICU for drug-induced acute kidney injury, a 27-year-old woman develops fever. She is currently on a ventilator and sedatives. Hemodialysis is performed via a catheter placed in the right internal jugular vein. Feeding is via a nasogastric tube. An indwelling urinary catheter shows minimum output. Her blood pressure is 85/45 mm Hg, the pulse is 112/min, the respirations are 32/min, and the temperature is 39.6\u00b0C (103.3\u00b0F). The examination of the central catheter shows erythema around the insertion site with no discharge. Lung auscultation shows rhonchi. Cardiac examination shows no new findings. A chest CT scan shows bilateral pleural effusions with no lung infiltration. Empirical antibiotic therapy is initiated. Blood cultures obtained from peripheral blood and the catheter tip show S. aureus with a similar antibiogram. Urinary culture obtained from the indwelling catheter shows polymicrobial growth. Which of the following best explains this patient\u2019s recent findings?\nOptions:\nA. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection\nB. Central catheter-related bacteremia\nC. Endocarditis\nD.

His physical exam is within normal limits. Screening lab work is ordered with the following values:\nPlatelet count 330,000/mm3\nBleeding time 6 mins\nProthrombin time 12 sec\nActivated partial thromboplastin time 42 sec\nFactor VIII activity decreased\nRistocetin cofactor assay decreased\nHe is subsequently referred to a hematologist for further work-up and treatment. Which of the following aspects of coagulation would most likely be affected?\nOptions:\nA. Factor IX\nB. Gp Ib\nC. Factor XI\nD. Vitamin K\nE. Antithrombin III\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: B, Gp Ib\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease, a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF). VWF is a protein that plays a crucial role in platelet adhesion and aggregation, and it also carries and stabilizes factor VIII. The decreased factor VIII activity and ristocetin cofactor assay results support this diagnosis. Gp Ib is a platelet receptor that interacts with VWF, and its dysfunction would affect platelet adhesion and aggregation, leading to bleeding symptoms.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A group of environmental health scientists recently performed a nationwide cross-sectional study that investigated the risk of head and neck cancers in patients with a history of cigar and pipe smoking. In collaboration with three teams of epidemiologists that have each conducted similar cross-sectional studies in their respective countries, they have agreed to contribute their data to an international pooled analysis of the relationship between non-cigarette tobacco consumption and prevalence of head and neck cancers. Which of the following statements regarding the pooled analysis in comparison to the individual studies is true?\nOptions:\nA. It overcomes limitations in the quality of individual studies.\nB. It is able to provide evidence of causality.\nC. The results are less precise.\nD. The likelihood of type II errors is decreased.\nE. The level of clinical evidence is lower.\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, The likelihood of type II errors is decreased.\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A previously healthy 33-year-old woman comes to the emergency department 1 hour after falling from a ladder. She is conscious. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There is no family history of serious illness. Her pulse is 72/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 110/72 mm Hg. Physical examination shows ecchymosis and point tenderness over the right clavicle. An x-ray of the chest shows a nondisplaced fracture of the midshaft of the right clavicle and a 3.5-mm pulmonary nodule in the central portion of the left upper lung field. No previous x-rays of the patient are available. The fracture is treated with pain management and immobilization with a sling. A CT scan of the chest shows that the pulmonary nodule is solid and has well-defined, smooth borders. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient's pulmonary nodule?\nOptions:\nA. Reassurance\nB. Follow-up CT scan of the chest in 6\u201312 months\nC. Follow-up x-ray of the chest in 6\u201312 months\nD. CT-guided transthoracic biopsy\nE. Bronchoscopy with biopsy\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Reassurance\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 10-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of recurring episodes of achy muscle pain in his legs. He has a history of poor school performance despite tutoring and has been held back two grades. He is at the 40th percentile for height and 30th percentile for weight. Examination shows ptosis, a high-arched palate, and muscle weakness in the face and hands; muscle strength of the quadriceps and hamstrings is normal. Sensation is intact. Percussion of the thenar eminence causes the thumb to abduct and then relax slowly. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause?\nOptions:\nA. Apoptosis of lower motor neurons\nB. Defect of voltage-gated sodium channels of the sarcolemmal membrane\nC. Complete impairment of the dystrophin protein\nD. Humoral immune attack against the endomysial blood vessels\nE. CTG trinucleotide expansion in the DMPK gene\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, CTG trinucleotide expansion in the DMPK gene\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 33-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 26 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department because of frequent contractions. The contractions last 40 seconds, occur every 2 minutes, and are increasing in intensity. She has a history of recurrent painful ulcers on her vulva, but she currently does not have them. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a non-reassuring fetal heart rate. Her current medications include acyclovir, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), heart rate is 88/min, and blood pressure is 126/76 mm Hg. Contractions are felt on the abdomen. The cervix is dilated to 5 cm, 70% effaced, and the station of the head is -2. A fetal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Allow vaginal delivery\nB. Initiate misoprostol therapy\nC. Initiate nifedipine therapy\nD. Perform cesarean delivery\nE. Perform dilation and evacuation\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Initiate nifedipine therapy.\n\nThe patient is experiencing frequent contractions and is at 26 weeks' gestation, which indicates preterm labor. The goal of management is to delay delivery to allow for fetal maturation. Nifedipine is a tocolytic medication that can help relax the uterus and slow down contractions, allowing for a delay in delivery. This is the most appropriate next step in management.\n\nAllowing vaginal delivery (Option A) is not appropriate at this gestational age, as the fetus is not yet mature enough to survive outside the womb. Misoprostol (Option B) is a medication that can induce labor, which is the opposite of what is needed in this situation. Performing a cesarean delivery (Option D) may be necessary if the fetus is in distress or if the mother's life is at risk, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. Performing dilation and evacuation (Option E) is not relevant to this situation, as it is a procedure typically used for terminating a pregnancy, not for managing preterm labor.",

After being aroused, the patient has difficulty answering questions and appears to be frustrated by his inability to communicate. He is able to speak his name and a few other words but his speech is not fluent. Subsequent neurologic exam finds that the patient is able to comprehend both one and two step instructions; however, he is unable to repeat phrases despite being able to understand them. He also has difficulty writing despite retaining fine motor control. CT reveals an acute stroke to his left hemisphere. Damage to which of the following sets of structures would be most likely to result in this pattern of deficits?\nOptions:\nA. Inferior frontal gyrus\nB. Superior temporal gyrus\nC. Arcuate fasciculus\nD. Watershed zone\nE. Precentral gyrus\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Inferior frontal gyrus\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. He has had multiple falls while walking and running for the past 4 months. He used to be able to climb stairs independently but now requires assistance. He started speaking in 2-word sentences at 2 years of age. He is at the 50th percentile for height and the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows a waddling gait and enlargement of bilateral calves. Muscle strength is decreased in the bilateral lower extremities. Patellar and ankle reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. To rise from a sitting position, he uses his hands to support himself to an upright position. Diagnosis is confirmed by a muscle biopsy and immunohistochemistry. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the most severe clinical presentation of this disease?\nOptions:\nA. Same sense mutation\nB. Silent mutation\nC. Missense mutation\nD. Splice site mutation\nE. Frameshift mutation\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Frameshift mutation\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 34-year-old woman presents to the physician because of fever and sore throat for 2 days. She also reports generalized body pain and fatigue over this period. She was diagnosed with Graves\u2019 disease 6 months ago. Because of arthralgias and rash due to methimazole 3 months ago, her physician switched methimazole to PTU. She appears ill. The vital signs include: temperature 38.4\u2103 (101.1\u2109), pulse 88/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg. A 1 \u00d7 1 cm ulcer is seen on the side of the tongue and is painful with surrounding erythema. Examination of the neck, lungs, heart, and abdomen shows no abnormalities. She had normal liver aminotransferases last week. Which of the following is the most important diagnostic study at this time?\nOptions:\nA. Alanine aminotransferase\nB. Complete blood count with differential\nC. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\nD. Thyroid-stimulating hormone\nE. No further testing is indicated\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Complete blood count with differential\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 3-year-old refugee with increasing pitting edema and abdominal swelling over the past 2 months is brought to the physician. Her family has been displaced several times over the last few years. Nutrition and housing were frequently inadequate. At the physician\u2019s clinic, the boy appears irritated and drowsy. He is difficult to arouse. Physical examination shows pitting edema over the ankles and feet and around his eyes. Abdominal examination is positive for ascites and hepatomegaly. Oral examination shows several missing teeth. Which of the following best explains these findings?\nOptions:\nA. Kwashiorkor\nB. Marasmus\nC. Beriberi\nD. Rickets\nE. Scurvy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Kwashiorkor.\n\nKwashiorkor is a form of protein-energy malnutrition that is common in children who have inadequate nutrition, often due to poverty, conflict, or displacement. The symptoms described in the question, such as pitting edema, abdominal swelling, irritability, and difficulty arousing, are consistent with kwashiorkor. The presence of ascites and hepatomegaly also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the fact that the child has missing teeth suggests a lack of adequate nutrition, which is a hallmark of kwashiorkor.\n\nMarasmus (option B) is another form of protein-energy malnutrition, but it typically presents with a more emaciated appearance, whereas kwashiorkor is characterized by edema and swelling.\n\nBeriberi (option C) is a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1) that can cause edema, but it is not typically associated with protein-energy malnutrition.\n\nRickets (option D) is a condition caused by vitamin D deficiency, which can lead to bone deformities, but it is not typically associated with edema or abdominal swelling.\n\nScurvy (option E) is a deficiency of vitamin C, which can cause fatigue, malaise, and bleeding gums, but it is not typically associated with edema or abdominal swelling.",

Acetazolamide\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Spironolactone\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: An otherwise healthy 57-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of progressive shortness of breath and exercise intolerance for the past 5 days. He denies recent travel or illicit habits. His temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.1\u00b0F), the blood pressure is 88/57 mm Hg, and the pulse is 102/min. The radial pulse becomes so weak with inspiration. Physical examination reveals bilateral 1+ pedal edema. There is jugular venous distention at 13 cm and muffled heart sounds. Transthoracic echocardiogram shows reciprocal respiratory ventricular inflow and ventricular diastolic collapse. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient condition?\nOptions:\nA. Cardiac catheterization\nB. Pericardiectomy\nC. Pericardial drainage\nD. Chest X-ray\nE. Cardiac MRI\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Pericardial drainage\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 27-year-old G3P1010 makes an appointment with her gynecologist for evaluation of profuse bleeding, which began two days ago. She is 13 weeks pregnant based on the date of her last menstrual period. She is dizzy and weak, and is unable to move around the house and perform her daily tasks. Initially, she had only light spotting, but later on in the day the bleeding increased. Thus far, she has used six sanitary pads. The blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, the temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), the pulse is 125/min, and the respiratory rate is 14/min. A saline infusion is started, and blood and urine specimens are sent for analysis. On pelvic examination, the vagina contains blood and the cervical os is open. She also complains of cervical motion and adnexal tenderness on examination. An ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac low in the uterine cavity. No fetal movement or cardiac activity are observed. She is advised to rest for a couple of hours, after which the scan is repeated. Slight downward migration of the gestational sac is observed with no change in the fetal status. Which of the following is the next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Antibiotics\nB. Bed rest and analgesics\nC. Magnesium sulfate\nD. Methotrexate\nE. Dilation and curettage\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Dilation and curettage.\n\nThe patient is experiencing profuse bleeding and is 13 weeks pregnant, but the ultrasound shows no fetal movement or cardiac activity, indicating a non-viable pregnancy. The downward migration of the gestational sac on repeat scan suggests an incomplete abortion. Given the patient's symptoms and the ultrasound findings, the next step in management is to perform a dilation and curettage (D&C) to evacuate the uterus and prevent further bleeding and complications.",

She went camping with her new boyfriend 3 weeks ago but does not recall any tick bites. Her temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F). Examination of the right knee shows swelling, warmth, and tenderness on passive movement. There is a tender pustule on the sole of the left foot. Arthrocentesis of the right knee joint yields 8 mL of cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 45,000/mm3 (90% segmented neutrophils with intracellular organisms). Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for this patient's condition?\nOptions:\nA. Autoantibody production\nB. Intravenous drug use\nC. Sexually transmitted infection\nD. HLA-B 27 positivity\nE. Bacterial pharyngitis\n\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Sexually transmitted infection.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including pain and swelling of the right knee joint and left wrist, along with the presence of a tender pustule on the sole of the left foot, are consistent with a diagnosis of disseminated gonococcal infection. The arthrocentesis results, showing cloudy fluid with a high leukocyte count and intracellular organisms, further support this diagnosis. The strongest risk factor for this patient's condition is the sexually transmitted infection, which is likely gonorrhea.",

Well-controlled studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy, and there is no evidence of risk in later trimesters.\nE. Levothyroxine can be safely used in the first trimester of pregnancy but should be discontinued in the second and third trimesters.\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Well-controlled studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy, and there is no evidence of risk in later trimesters.\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 73-year-old man presents to a dermatology clinic after his family physician finds an ulcerated plaque on the dorsal surface of his nose. This lesion has changed in size and form and has bled on multiple occasions even after the patient adopted sun-protection measures. The patient\u2019s medical history is relevant for cigarette smoking and hypertension. Physical examination reveals a poorly defined, erythematous, ulcerated plaque on the surface of the nose (see image). The lesion is diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma, and the patient undergoes standard excision. However, the pathology report indicates an incomplete excision. Which of the following should be the next step in the management of this case?\nOptions:\nA. Mohs surgery\nB. Photodynamic therapy\nC. Cryotherapy\nD. Radiation therapy\nE. Imiquimod\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Mohs surgery\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 54-year-old man comes to the clinic for management of his gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He is currently on cimetidine for his condition and reports that his GERD initially improved. However, following his recent move to Michigan, he is experiencing more frequent episodes of chest pain (4-5 times a week). The pain is described as burning in quality and is concentrated around his epigastric region following food ingestion. It does not radiate anywhere and is alleviated when he takes antacids. A physical examination demonstrates a healthy male with unremarkable findings. He is subsequently prescribed a new medication for control of his symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism of action of this new medication?\nOptions:\nA. Irreversible inactivation of cyclooxygenase enzyme\nB. Irreversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells\nC. Irreversible inhibition of histamine H2 receptors\nD. Reversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells\nE. Reversible inhibition of histamine H2 receptors\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Reversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells.\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggest that the new medication is likely a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), which is commonly used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). PPIs work by reversibly inhibiting the H+/K+-ATPase enzyme at parietal cells in the stomach, thereby reducing acid production and alleviating symptoms of GERD.",

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Spectrin\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.\nMethods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.\nResults: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.\nConclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.\nIf the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?\nOptions:\nA. Measurement bias\nB. Recall bias\nC. Lead-time bias\nD. Selection bias\nE. Length-time bias\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: C, Lead-time bias\n\nExplanation: Lead-time bias occurs when a diagnostic test appears to improve outcomes because it detects a condition earlier, but the earlier detection does not actually change the natural course of the disease. In this case, if the conclusion that initial ultrasonography is associated with better outcomes is due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point-of-care ultrasound, it would be an example of lead-time bias. The earlier detection of nephrolithiasis may not actually change the outcome, but it would appear to do so because of the earlier detection.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A 1-day-old male infant is evaluated in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for dyspnea. He was born at 34 weeks gestation. Apgar scores were 6 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios. His mother is a healthy 33-year-old G1P1 woman who received adequate prenatal care. The nurse in the NICU noted increased oral secretions and intermittent desaturations. His temperature is 100.8\u00b0F (38.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 100/55 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 28/min. On exam, the child appears to be in respiratory distress. Intercostal retractions are noted. Auscultation of the lungs reveals rales bilaterally. The patient\u2019s abdomen is moderately distended. A chest radiograph is performed and demonstrates coiling of the nasogastric (NG) tube in the esophagus. This patient should be evaluated for which of the following conditions?\nOptions:\nA. Cryptorchidism\nB. Hirschsprung disease\nC. Meconium ileus\nD. Pyloric stenosis\nE. Ventricular septal defect\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Ventricular septal defect\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 17-year-old male is brought to the emergency department following a motor vehicle accident. He has suffered several wounds and is minimally responsive. There is a large laceration on his forehead as well as a fracture of his nasal bridge. He appears to be coughing and spitting blood. He is already wearing a soft collar. Vitals are as follows: T 36.4C, BP 102/70 mmHg, HR 126 bpm, and RR 18 rpm, and SpO2 is 88% on RA. He has 2 peripheral IVs and received 2L of IV normal saline on route to the hospital. There is frank blood in the oropharynx. Breath sounds are present bilaterally. Abdomen is distended and tender.

Orotracheal intubation\nD. Type and screen for matched blood transfusion\nE. Cricothyroidotomy\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Cricothyroidotomy\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of upper abdominal pain that occurs immediately after eating. The pain is sharp, localized to the epigastrium, and does not radiate. He reports that he has been eating less frequently to avoid the pain and has had a 4-kg (8.8-lb) weight loss during this time. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years and drinks 3 beers daily. His vital signs are within normal limits. He is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 76.6 kg (169 lb); BMI is 28 kg/m2. Physical examination shows mild upper abdominal tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. Laboratory studies are within the reference range. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following conditions?\nOptions:\nA. Malignant transformation\nB. Biliary tract infection\nC. Pyloric scarring\nD. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage\nE. Subhepatic abscess formation\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Gastrointestinal hemorrhage\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 58-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent painful retrosternal dullness for 4 weeks. The pain is recurrent and occurs when she exerts herself or when she is outside during cold weather. She also experiences shortness of breath and palpitations during these episodes. The symptoms resolve spontaneously when she stops or sits down for a while. Over the past few days, the episodes have increased in frequency. She has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. Her left leg was amputated below the knee after a motorcycle accident 25 years ago. She is currently waiting for a new prosthesis and walks with crutches. Current medications include captopril, glyburide, and ibuprofen. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her pulse is 88/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 144/90 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm without any signs of ischemia. Serum cardiac markers are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress\nB. Upper endoscopy\nC. Coronary angiography\nD. Echocardiography at rest\nE. Repeat ECG under treadmill stress\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as intermittent painful retrosternal dullness, shortness of breath, and palpitations, are suggestive of angina pectoris, which is a classic symptom of coronary artery disease. The fact that the symptoms are triggered by exertion and cold weather, and resolve with rest, further supports this diagnosis. The patient's risk factors, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a history of smoking (although she currently does not smoke), also increase her likelihood of having coronary artery disease.\n\nA myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress is a non-invasive test that can help diagnose coronary artery disease by assessing blood flow to the heart muscle. It is a suitable next step in diagnosis, especially since the patient's ECG and cardiac markers are normal, and there are no signs of ischemia on the ECG.",

Which of the following statements is the most accurate with respect to the presented case?\nOptions:\nA. This patient does not require further urinary tests unless she becomes symptomatic.\nB. Urinalysis should be performed on each subsequent antenatal visit to screen for possible recurrence of bacteriuria.\nC. Urine culture should be performed in this patient again.\nD. Perform urine dipstick assay for leukocyte esterase.\nE. Urinalysis should be performed to check for leukocytes, blood, and bacteria; if positive, perform a urine culture.\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: C. Urine culture should be performed in this patient again.\n\nExplanation: Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a common condition in pregnancy, and it is recommended to perform a urine culture after treatment to ensure that the infection has been cleared. This is because asymptomatic bacteriuria can increase the risk of pyelonephritis and preterm labor if left untreated. Therefore, in this case, it is necessary to perform a urine culture again to confirm that the infection has been eradicated.",

She has also noticed gradual development of facial discoloration. She has coronary artery disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. She does not remember which medications she takes. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 150/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Examination shows blue-gray discoloration of the face and both hands. Diffuse inspiratory crackles are heard. An x-ray of the chest shows reticular opacities around the lung periphery and particularly around the lung bases. The most likely cause of this patient's findings is an adverse effect to which of the following medications?\nOptions:\nA. Procainamide\nB. Lisinopril\nC. Metoprolol\nD. Amiodarone\nE. Warfarin\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Amiodarone\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of a sudden loss of consciousness. He has asthma and has been hospitalized multiple times. His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is somnolent and diaphoretic. Serum studies show a glucose concentration of 22 mg/dL and a potassium concentration of 2.4 mEq/L. A dextrose infusion is administered, after which his glucose concentration normalizes and his symptoms improve. He is admitted to the hospital for further observation. Overnight, he has another episode of decreased consciousness. Serum studies taken during the episode show a glucose concentration of 19 mg/dL, an insulin concentration of 108 mIU/L (N=2.6\u201324.9), and a C-peptide concentration of 0.3 ng/mL (N = 0.8\u20133.1). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Malingering\nB. Glucagonoma\nC. Primary adrenal insufficiency\nD. Conversion disorder\nE. Factitious disorder imposed on another\n\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Factitious disorder imposed on another.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including sudden loss of consciousness, somnolence, and diaphoresis, are consistent with hypoglycemia. The laboratory results show low glucose levels, high insulin levels, and low C-peptide levels, which suggest exogenous insulin administration. The fact that the patient's symptoms improve after dextrose infusion and that he has a history of asthma and multiple hospitalizations suggest that someone, likely the mother, is intentionally inducing hypoglycemia in the child. This is consistent with factitious disorder imposed on another, also known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy.",

There is diffuse reddish-brown discoloration and significant scaling extending from the ankle to the mid-thigh bilaterally. Pedal pulses and sensation are intact bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Type IV hypersensitivity reaction\nB. Venous valve incompetence\nC. Malignant proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes\nD. Dermal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans\nE. Breach of skin barrier by dermatophyte\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Venous valve incompetence\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 53-year-old man presents to clinic with a six month history of shoulder pain that is especially bothersome at night. Over the weekend he \"strained his shoulder\" during a pick-up basketball game and reports an acute exacerbation of his pain symptoms. On exam, he complains of pain to palpation just below the acromion. You suspect he has torn his supraspinatus. If correct, which of these functional maneuvers would you expect to be deficient on physical exam?\nOptions:\nA. Initiation of adduction\nB. External rotation\nC. Initiation of abduction\nD. Completion of abduction\nE. Internal rotation\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Initiation of abduction.\n\nThe supraspinatus muscle is responsible for initiating abduction of the shoulder, which is the movement of the arm away from the midline of the body. If the supraspinatus muscle is torn, the patient would likely have difficulty initiating abduction, which would be evident on physical exam.",

Administer glucagon.\n\nThe patient is experiencing anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, likely due to the bee sting. The symptoms include dyspnea, wheezing, palpitations, and angioedema. Despite initial treatment with epinephrine and fluid resuscitation, the patient's blood pressure remains low. The patient is taking labetalol, a beta-blocker, which can reduce the effectiveness of epinephrine. Glucagon is a medication that can help counteract the effects of beta-blockers and is often used in anaphylaxis treatment when epinephrine is not effective.",

Anti-Ro antibody\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Direct Coomb\u2019s test with anti-C3 reagent\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 20-year-old man who is a biology major presents to his physician for a simple check-up. He is informed that he hasn\u2019t received a hepatitis B vaccine. When the first injection is applied, the medical professional informs him that he will need to come back 2 more times on assigned days, since the vaccine is given in 3 doses. Which of the following antibodies is the physician trying to increase in the college student as a result of the first vaccination?\nOptions:\nA. IgG\nB. IgA\nC. IgM\nD. IgD\nE. IgE\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, IgM\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 27-year-old G0P0 female presents to her OB/GYN for a preconception visit to seek advice before becoming pregnant. A detailed history reveals no prior medical or surgical history, and she appears to be in good health currently. Her vaccination history is up-to-date. She denies tobacco or recreational drug use and admits to drinking 2 glasses of wine per week. She states that she is looking to start trying to become pregnant within the next month, hopefully by the end of January. Which of the following is NOT recommended as a next step for this patient's preconception care?\nOptions:\nA. Begin 400 mcg folic acid supplementation\nB.

He is on an experimental drug (drug X) that is used to reduce the action of testosterone by blocking the androgen receptor. Since the initiation of therapy, the growth of the cancerous tissue has slowed. This medication is known to be excreted by the kidneys at the current dose that he is taking. The patient has no significant complaints, except for excessive sweating at times. On physical examination, a small area of tissue around his nipples is enlarged bilaterally. No other abnormal findings are present. Which of the following drugs most likely belongs to be the same class as drug X?\nOptions:\nA. Leuprolide\nB. Finasteride\nC. Flutamide\nD. Terazosin\nE. Anastrozole\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Flutamide.\n\nDrug X is described as blocking the androgen receptor, which suggests that it is an anti-androgen medication. The patient's symptoms, such as excessive sweating and bilateral nipple tissue enlargement, are consistent with feminization, which is a known side effect of anti-androgen therapy.\n\nFlutamide is a non-steroidal anti-androgen medication that is used to treat prostate cancer by blocking the androgen receptor. It is likely to be in the same class as drug X.\n\nLeuprolide is a GnRH agonist that reduces testosterone levels by suppressing the pituitary gland's production of luteinizing hormone.\n\nFinasteride is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that reduces the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, but it does not directly block the androgen receptor.\n\nTerazosin is an alpha-1 blocker used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and hypertension.\n\nAnastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor used to treat breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and it does not directly block the androgen receptor.",

She has asthma treated with theophylline and inhaled salbutamol. Her younger sister was diagnosed with endometrial cancer a year ago. Examination shows a weeping, ulcerated lesion involving the entire left nipple-areolar complex. There are no breast masses, dimpling, or axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Inflammatory breast cancer\nB. Mastitis\nC. Breast abscess\nD. Breast fibroadenoma\nE. Paget disease of the breast\n\"\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Paget disease of the breast\n\"\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 43-year-old man presents to the emergency department following a work-related accident in which both arms were amputated. The patient lost a substantial amount of blood prior to arrival, and his bleeding is difficult to control due to arterial damage and wound contamination with debris. His complete blood count (CBC) is significant for a hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 5.3 g/dL. The trauma surgery resident initiates the massive transfusion protocol and orders whole blood, O negative, which she explains is the universal donor. The patient receives 6 units of O negative blood prior to admission. He subsequently develops fever, chills, hematuria, and pulmonary edema. Several hours later, the patient goes into hemodynamic shock requiring the emergent administration of vasopressors. Of the following options, which hypersensitivity reaction occurred?\nOptions:\nA. Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction\nB. Type 2 hypersensitivity reaction\nC. Type 3 hypersensitivity reaction\nD. Type 4 hypersensitivity reaction\nE.

He reports pain with climbing stairs and with extended walks of greater than 100 yards. The pain worsens with activity throughout the day and is alleviated by periods of rest. He states that he has minimal morning stiffness, lasting approximately 5-10 minutes after waking up most days. Physical examination reveals tenderness to palpation of the bony structures on the medial aspect of the bilateral knees as well as crepitus and a decreased range of motion, limited at the extremes of flexion and extension. Both knee joints are cool to touch and exhibit bony enlargement upon palpation of the medial joint line. Which of the following studies would be indicated for further work-up of this patient's presenting condition?\nOptions:\nA. Complete blood count (CBC)\nB. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)\nC. Rheumatoid factor (RF)\nD. MRI of the knee\nE. No further work-up needed\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: D. MRI of the knee\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knees. The presence of bilateral knee pain, worsened by activity and relieved by rest, along with tenderness to palpation of the bony structures, crepitus, and decreased range of motion, are all characteristic of OA. The patient's age and lack of morning stiffness also support this diagnosis. An MRI of the knee would be indicated to further evaluate the extent of joint damage and cartilage loss, which would help guide treatment decisions. The other options are not directly related to the diagnosis or management of OA.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: Immediately following prolonged delivery of the placenta at 40 weeks gestation, a 32-year-old multiparous woman develops vaginal bleeding. Other than mild asthma, the patient\u2019s pregnancy has been uncomplicated. She has attended many prenatal appointments and followed the physician's advice about screening for diseases, laboratory testing, diet, and exercise. Previous pregnancies were uncomplicated. She has no history of a serious illness. She is currently on intravenous infusion of oxytocin. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 17/min. Uterine palpation reveals a soft enlarged fundus that extends above the umbilicus. Based on the assessment of the birth canal and placenta, which of the following options is the most appropriate initial step in patient management?\nOptions:\nA. Discontinuing oxytocin\nB. Intramuscular carboprost\nC. Intravenous methylergonovine\nD. Manual exploration of the uterus\nE.

Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 90%. Examination shows pale extremities. Grunting and moderate subcostal retractions are present. Pulmonary examination shows decreased breath sounds bilaterally. Supplemental oxygen is administered. Ten minutes later, his pulse is 148/min and respirations are 66/min. Pulse oximetry on 60% oxygen shows an oxygen saturation of 90%. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Respiratory distress syndrome\nB. Meconium aspiration syndrome\nC. Tracheomalacia\nD. Neonatal pneumonia\nE. Tracheoesophageal fistula\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Respiratory distress syndrome\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 27-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 45 minutes after being involved in a motor vehicle collision. He is agitated. He has pain in his upper right arm, which he is cradling in his left arm. His temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98\u00b0F), pulse is 135/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 145/90 mm Hg. His breathing is shallow. Pulse oximetry on 100% oxygen via a non-rebreather face mask shows an oxygen saturation of 83%. He is confused and oriented only to person. Examination shows multiple bruises on the right anterior thoracic wall. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. On inspiration, his right chest wall demonstrates paradoxical inward movement while his left chest wall is expanding. There is pain to palpation and crepitus over his right anterior ribs. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest is shown. Two large-bore IVs are placed. After fluid resuscitation and analgesia, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Placement of a chest tube\nB. Intubation with positive pressure ventilation\nC. Bedside thoracotomy\nD. CT scan of the chest\nE. Surgical fixation of right third to sixth ribs\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Intubation with positive pressure ventilation\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 66-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction presents to your primary care office with complaints of dyspnea on exertion and swollen feet and ankles. On exam, you note an elevated JVP and 2+ pitting edema of bilateral lower extremities. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema?\nOptions:\nA. Increase in capillary pressure\nB. Decrease in plasma proteins\nC. Increase in capillary permeability\nD. Increase in colloid osmotic pressure\nE. Increase in interstitial fluid pressure\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Increase in capillary pressure.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, elevated JVP, and bilateral lower extremity edema suggest heart failure, which is likely related to his history of myocardial infarction. In heart failure, the heart is unable to pump effectively, leading to increased pressure in the veins and capillaries. This increased pressure pushes fluid out of the capillaries and into the interstitial space, causing edema. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema is an increase in capillary pressure.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A 34-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of a breast lump she noticed 2 days ago while showering. She has no history of major illness. Her mother died of ovarian cancer at age 38, and her sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 33. Examination shows a 1.5-cm, nontender, mobile mass in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Mammography shows pleomorphic calcifications. Biopsy of the mass shows invasive ductal carcinoma. The underlying cause of this patient's condition is most likely a mutation of a gene involved in which of the following cellular events?\nOptions:\nA. Activity of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase\nB. Arrest of cell cycle in G1 phase\nC. Repair of double-stranded DNA breaks\nD. Inhibition of programmed cell death\nE. Regulation of intercellular adhesion\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Repair of double-stranded DNA breaks\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 65-year-old woman returns to the outpatient oncology clinic to follow up on her recently diagnosed breast cancer. A few months ago, she noticed a lump during a breast self-exam that was shown to be breast cancer. A lumpectomy revealed invasive ductal carcinoma that was estrogen- and progesterone receptor-positive with nodal metastases. She is following up to discuss treatment options. She had her last menstrual period 10 years ago and has not had any spotting since that time. Her mother had breast cancer and she remembered her taking chemotherapy and had a poor quality of life, thus she asks not to be treated similarly. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the best treatment option for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Antagonist for estrogen receptors in the breast\nB. Cell cycle arrest\nC. Antagonist for estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus\nD. Inhibit peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogen\nE. Estrogen receptors downregulation in the breast\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Inhibit peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogen\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 25-year-old woman presents with fever, rash, abdominal pain, and vaginal discharge for the past 3 days. She describes the pain as moderate, cramping in character, and diffusely localized to the suprapubic region. She says the rash is painless and does not itch. She also complains of associated generalized muscle aches and vomiting since last night. The patient denies any recent menstrual irregularities, dysuria, painful urination or similar symptoms in the past. Her past medical history is significant for chronic asthma, managed medically. There is no recent travel or sick contacts. Patient denies any smoking history, alcohol or recreational drug use. She has been sexually active for the past year with a single partner and has been using oral contraceptive pills. Her vital signs include: temperature 38.6\u00b0C (101.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 90/68 mm Hg, pulse 120/min, and respirations 20/min. Physical examination reveals a diffuse erythematous desquamating maculopapular rash over the lower abdomen and inner thighs. There is moderate tenderness to palpation of the suprapubic and lower right quadrants with no rebound or guarding. Abdomen is non-distended with no hepatosplenomegaly. Pelvic examination reveals a purulent vaginal discharge. Which of the following best describes the organism responsible for this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. Gram-negative cocci in clusters producing an enterotoxin\nB. Gram-positive cocci in clusters producing superantigens\nC. Gram-positive bacilli in pairs producing superantigens\nD. Gram-negative bacilli in chain producing an endotoxin\nE. Gram-positive cocci in chain producing an exotoxin\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Gram-positive cocci in clusters producing superantigens\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 70-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department after 3 days of shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower limb edema. His personal history is significant for a myocardial infarction 6 years ago that required revascularization and hypertension. His medication consists of simvastatin and lisinopril.  In the ED, he has a blood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, a pulse of 88/min, a respiratory rate of 28/min, and a temperature of 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F). On physical examination, he has jugular vein distention, displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), an S4-gallop, a holosystolic murmur, and 2+ pitting edema up to the mid calf.  He is started on furosemide, carvedilol, and oxygen therapy. After 6-hours of continued therapy, his blood pressure remains low, and his serum creatinine is found to be 1.9 mg/dL. Which of the following test would be more useful to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease?\nOptions:\nA. Sulfosalicylic acid test\nB. Urine sodium content\nC. Fractional excretion of sodium Na+ (FENa+)\nD. Fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea)\nE. Nitrates in urine\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: C, Fractional excretion of sodium Na+ (FENa+)\n\nExplanation: The patient is presenting with symptoms of heart failure, and the low blood pressure and elevated serum creatinine suggest possible kidney injury. The differential diagnosis includes prerenal azotemia (due to decreased blood flow to the kidneys) versus intrinsic kidney disease. The fractional excretion of sodium (FENa+) is a useful test to differentiate between these two possibilities. A low FENa+ (<1%) suggests prerenal azotemia, while a high FENa+ (>2%) suggests intrinsic kidney disease.",

In 2017, there were 1,500 live births and, upon further inspection of the birth certificates, 108 of these children had a low birth weight (i.e. lower than 2,500 g), while 237 had mothers who smoked continuously during pregnancy. Further calculations have shown that the risk of low birth weight in smokers was 14% and in non-smokers, it was 7%, while the relative risk of low birth weight linked to cigarette smoking during pregnancy was 2%. In other words, women who smoked during pregnancy were twice as likely as those who did not smoke to deliver a low-weight infant. Using this data, you are also asked to calculate how much of the excess risk for low birth weight, in percentage terms, can be attributed to smoking. What is the attributable risk for smoking leading to low birth weight?\nOptions:\nA. 10%\nB. 20%\nC. 30%\nD. 40%\nE. 50%\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, 50%\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 74-year-old male is brought to the emergency department 1 hour after he fell from the top of the staircase at home.

Cervical myelography\nD. X-ray of the cervical spine\nE. MRI of the cervical spine without contrast\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, MRI of the cervical spine without contrast\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 26-year-old Caucasian woman is admitted to the emergency department after 4 days of fever, malaise, vomiting, and nausea for which she has been taking ibuprofen and diclofenac. She has also noticed a decrease in urination. Her family and past medical history are unremarkable. Her temperature is 38.2\u00b0C (100.7\u00b0F), blood pressure is 118/76 mm Hg, heart rate is 74/min, and respiratory rate is 15/min. Upon physical examination, her mucous membranes are moist and she has no abdominal tenderness. Four hours after admission, she has a urinary output < 0.3 mL/kg/h and laboratory tests significant for the following:\nDifferential blood count\nWhite blood cells 8.1 x 109/L\nNeutrophils 4.8 x 109/L\nLymphocytes 2.1 x 109/L\nEosinophils 0.9 x 109/L\nMonocytes 0.3 x 109/L\nBasophils 0.04 x 109/L\n  Serum creatinine (SCr) 1.9 mg/dL\nBlood urea nitrogen (BUN) 25 mg/dL\nNa+ 135 mEq/L\nK+ 5.4 mEq/L\nCl- 106 mEq/L\nUrine dipstick\nUrine density 1.010\npH 6.2\nRed blood cells per field of high power 2\nWBC casts Present\nWhich of the following skin manifestations would you also expect to find in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Livedo reticularis\nB. Janeway lesions\nC. Diffuse maculopapular rash\nD. Malar rash\nE. Erythema nodosum\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: C. Diffuse maculopapular rash\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) caused by an allergic reaction to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and diclofenac. AIN is often accompanied by a skin rash, which in this case would be a diffuse maculopapular rash.",

Sodium bicarbonate\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Pralidoxime\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: An 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of concern that he has not yet begun to walk. He was born at term and exclusively breastfed until 15 months of age. His mother says he has been well, apart from an episode of high fever and seizure 4 months ago for which she did not seek medical attention. He has an older brother who is currently receiving medical treatment for failure to thrive. His parents have no history of serious illness; they are of normal height. His last vaccine was at the age of 4 months. He is at the 20th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 50th percentile for head circumference. Physical examination shows dry mucous membranes and erosion of the enamel on the lingual surface of the incisors and carious molars. He has frontal bossing. His wrists are widened, his legs seem bent, and there is beading of the ribs. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's delay in walking?\nOptions:\nA. Defect in type I collagen\nB. Defective growth plate mineralization\nC. Mutation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3\nD. Deficiency of osteoclasts to reabsorb bone\nE. Osteoid proliferation in the subperiosteal bone\n\"\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Defective growth plate mineralization\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 65-year-old man with no significant medical history begins to have memory loss and personality changes. Rapidly, over the next few months his symptoms increase in severity. He experiences a rapid mental deterioration associated with sudden, jerking movements, particularly in response to being startled. He has gait disturbances as well. Eventually, he lapses into a coma and dies approximately ten months after the onset of symptoms.

He is not coughing up any sputum. He says that he is the quarterback of his high school's football team and wants to get back to training as soon as possible. The patient's father had a myocardial infarction at the age of 45 years and underwent cardiac catheterization and stenting. The patient has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. His temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 118/66 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Echocardiography\nB. Cardiac stress testing\nC. Creatine kinase and troponin T\nD. 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring\nE. Reassurance\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Reassurance\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 52-year-old man presents to the clinic with a headache and dizziness for the past month. The patient reports that about 4 weeks ago he developed a \u201cnagging\u201d headache. He thought he had a cold, so he tried over the counter ibuprofen that provided only mild and temporary relief. Recently, he also started feeling dizzy and nauseous, which only resolves when he steps outside to shovel the snow. The patient\u2019s medical history is significant for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and asthma. His medications include amlodipine, metformin, glimepiride, and a fluticasone/salmeterol inhaler. The patient has been living at his upstate cabin for the past 5 weeks but denies other recent travel. He denies smoking tobacco or illicit drug use. The patient\u2019s temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/78 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 16/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is currently asymptomatic while sitting in the office, and physical examination is unremarkable. Labs are drawn, as shown below:\n\nHemoglobin: 20 g/dL\nHematocrit: 60%\nLeukocyte count: 10,050 cells/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 350,000/mm^3\n\nWhich of the following underlies the patient\u2019s most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Medication side effect\nB. Myeloproliferative neoplasm\nC. Neuronal hyperexcitability\nD. Toxic exposure\nE. Viral infection\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Toxic exposure.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of headache and dizziness, along with the laboratory results showing elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit, suggest that the patient has polycythemia, which is an overproduction of red blood cells. The patient's recent move to a high-altitude cabin (upstate cabin) and the resolution of symptoms when he steps outside to shovel snow suggest that the patient is experiencing altitude-related polycythemia. This is caused by the body's response to low oxygen levels at high altitudes, which stimulates the production of red blood cells.",

Gram negative bacilli\nC. Pear shaped motile cells\nD. Branching pseudohyphae\nE. Multinucleated giant cells\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Multinucleated giant cells\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 23-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency department with a persistent penile erection for the last 6 hours. He recently began outpatient treatment for depression with associated insomnia. He traveled to Mexico 5 months ago. His medical history is otherwise unremarkable.\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely precipitating factor for priapism in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Depression treatment with bupropion\nB. Depression treatment with venlafaxine\nC. Depression treatment with trazodone\nD. Sickle cell disease\nE. Infection acquired in Mexico\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Depression treatment with trazodone\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 20-year-old woman comes to the clinic for her first follow-up visit after being diagnosed with bipolar I disorder 1-month ago. At that time, she was acutely severely manic and was brought to the emergency department by her concerned boyfriend. She was started on lithium, and after subsequent improvement, she was discharged. A week after discharge, the patient forgot to take her medication for a few days and quickly began to manifest manic symptoms again which required brought her to the emergency department again. Since then, she has been compliant with her medications and currently has no significant complaints. Which of the following recommendations would be most helpful in minimizing the risk to the fetus in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Adjust dosage of medication throughout the pregnancy\nB. Supplement all patients with 5mg of daily folic acid\nC. Low-dose polytherapy is preferred over monotherapy\nD. Discontinue the medication when conception is confirmed\nE.

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of a burning sensation when urinating and increased urinary frequency. She is concerned about having contracted a sexually transmitted disease. Physical examination shows suprapubic tenderness. Urinalysis shows a negative nitrite test and positive leukocyte esterases. Urine culture grows organisms that show resistance to novobiocin on susceptibility testing. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism of this patient's symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Staphylococcus epidermidis\nB. Pseudomonas aeruginosa\nC. Klebsiella pneumoniae\nD. Proteus mirabilis\nE. Staphylococcus saprophyticus\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Staphylococcus saprophyticus\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A male infant is born at 27 weeks following premature rupture of membranes and a precipitous labor to a G4P3 female. Given the speed of delivery steroids are not given. Shortly after delivery he develops respiratory distress and the decision is made to administer surfactant replacement therapy.

Protein S\nB. Zinc finger protein\nC. Cholesterol\nD. Surfactant-associated proteins\nE. Phospholipids\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Phospholipids\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 31-year-old man comes to the physician because of several months of recurrent abdominal pain and diarrhea. Six months ago, he traveled to Lake Superior for a fishing trip with his friends, during which they often ate their day's catch for dinner. Physical examination shows pallor. Laboratory studies show macrocytic anemia with eosinophilia. A peripheral blood smear shows hypochromic red blood cells with megaloblasts and hypersegmented neutrophils. A cestode infection is suspected and a drug is prescribed that kills cestodes by inducing uncontrollable muscle spasm in the parasite. The drug prescribed for this patient most likely acts by which of the following mechanisms of action?\nOptions:\nA. Blockade of myosin binding sites\nB. Increased calcium influx into the sarcoplasm\nC. Increased sodium efflux from the sarcoplasm\nD. Increased potassium efflux from the sarcoplasm\nE. Phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Increased calcium influx into the sarcoplasm\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 19-year-old female presents to the emergency room with 6 days of lower abdominal pain. She states that her symptoms have progressed and she now feels feverish as well. She also notes an episode of nonbloody diarrhea 2 days ago and has been increasingly nauseous. While being evaluated in the emergency room, she vomits three times. The patient has no significant past medical history but was recently treated with ciprofloxacin for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection. She also notes irregular periods, with a last menstrual period 6 weeks ago. She is a college student who has had 3 sexual partners in the last year with inconsistent use of barrier protection. Her temperature is 100.5\u00b0C (38.1\u00b0F), blood pressure is 102/68 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, and respirations are 14/min. On exam, the patient is noticeably uncomfortable. There is marked tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic region and right lower quadrant, with voluntary guarding but no rebound. Pelvic exam shows moderate purulent discharge in the vaginal vault, cervical motion tenderness, and a tender adnexal mass on the right side. Which of the following is the best next step in treating this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline with outpatient follow-up\nB. Intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline with inpatient admission\nC. Oral vancomycin with outpatient follow-up\nD. Methotrexate with outpatient follow-up\nE. Exploratory laparotomy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline with inpatient admission.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is a serious infection of the female reproductive organs. The patient's recent treatment with ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection may have contributed to the development of PID. The presence of purulent discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and a tender adnexal mass on the right side support this diagnosis.\n\nGiven the severity of the patient's symptoms and the risk of complications, such as tubo-ovarian abscess or sepsis, inpatient admission and intravenous antibiotics are necessary. Cefotetan and doxycycline are appropriate antibiotics for the treatment of PID, covering a range of potential pathogens including Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and anaerobes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because outpatient management is not sufficient for this patient's condition, and intramuscular ceftriaxone may not provide adequate coverage for anaerobic organisms. Option C is incorrect because vancomycin is not typically used to treat PID, and outpatient follow-up is not sufficient for this patient's condition. Option D is incorrect because methotrexate is not an antibiotic and is not used to treat PID. Option E is incorrect because exploratory laparotomy is not the initial treatment of choice for PID, and may be reserved for cases that are refractory to medical therapy or have complications such as a tubo-ovarian abscess.",

The rash started on the face and spread to the trunk. He also had a fever and cough for the past 2 days. His mother says that they recently immigrated from Asia and cannot provide vaccination records. The physical examination reveals a maculopapular rash on the face, trunk, and proximal limbs with no lymphadenopathy. Blue-white spots are noted on the oral mucosa and there is bilateral mild conjunctival injection. The causative agent of this condition belongs to which of the following virus families?\nOptions:\nA. ssDNA enveloped viruses\nB. dsRNA enveloped viruses\nC. ssRNA naked viruses\nD. dsRNA naked viruses\nE. ssRNA enveloped viruses\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, ssRNA enveloped viruses\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 26-year-old man comes to the physician for evaluation of fatigue, facial rash, hair loss, and tingling of his hands and feet. He has followed a vegetarian diet for the past 3 years and has eaten 8 raw egg whites daily for the past year in preparation for a bodybuilding competition. Physical examination shows conjunctival injections and a scaly, erythematous rash around the eyes and mouth. Laboratory studies show decreased activity of propionyl-coenzyme A carboxylase in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Which of the following substances is most likely to be decreased in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Cystathionine\nB. Ribulose-5-phosphate\nC. Adenine\nD. Lactate\nE. Oxaloacetate\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Oxaloacetate\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 3-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mom for breathing difficulty after a recent fall. His parents say that he rolled off of the mattress and landed on the hard wood floor earlier today. After an extensive physical exam, he is found to have many purplish bruises and retinal hemorrhages. A non-contrast head CT scan shows a subdural hemorrhage. He was treated in the hospital with full recovery from his symptoms. Which of the following is the most important follow up plan?\nOptions:\nA. Inform child protective services\nB. Provide parents with anticipatory guidance\nC. Provide home nursing visits\nD. Reassurance that accidents are common\nE. Referral to genetics for further testing\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Inform child protective services\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 72-year-old man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital for the evaluation of breathlessness and fatigue. His pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Further evaluation shows a systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg \u00d7 min/L with an end-systolic volume of 80 mL. Which of the following describes the ejection fraction in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. 30%\nB. 15%\nC. 35%\nD. 25%\nE. 20%\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. 35%.\n\nExplanation: The patient's end-systolic volume is 80 mL, and the normal end-systolic volume is around 50-60 mL. The ejection fraction (EF) is calculated as:\n\nEF = (End-diastolic volume - End-systolic volume) / End-diastolic volume\n\nSince the end-diastolic volume is not provided, we can use the formula:\n\nEF = (Stroke volume / End-diastolic volume) \u00d7 100\n\nThe stroke volume can be estimated from the cardiac output (CO) and heart rate (HR):\n\nCO = HR \u00d7 Stroke volume\n\nGiven the patient's pulse is 100/min, and the systemic vascular resistance is 35 mm Hg \u00d7 min/L, we can estimate the cardiac output to be around 5-6 L/min (normal range). Assuming a stroke volume of around 60-70 mL (normal range), we can calculate the ejection fraction:\n\nEF = (60-70 mL / 120-140 mL) \u00d7 100 \u2248 35-40%\n\nTherefore, the closest answer is C. 35%.",

A pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and a blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg are observed. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings. The patient\u2019s ECG is difficult to interpret. Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility?\nOptions:\nA. Alanine aminotransferase\nB. Alkaline phosphatase\nC. Creatine kinase (CK-MB)\nD. Lactate dehydrogenase\nE. Troponin T\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: C, Creatine kinase (CK-MB)\n\nExplanation: The patient is experiencing chest pain again, which is similar to the initial symptoms of an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The most diagnostic laboratory test to determine if the patient is experiencing another myocardial infarction would be creatine kinase (CK-MB), which is a cardiac enzyme that is elevated in the blood after a heart attack. CK-MB is a more specific indicator of myocardial damage than troponin T, and an abnormal result would have high diagnostic utility in this scenario.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: An energy drink that claims to improve athletic performance is being investigated by a group of scientists for its mechanism of action. Although its exact mode of action is unknown, an active substance in the drink is thought to increase the activity of an ATPase involved in muscle contraction. By radiolabeling the active substance, scientists are able to trace it binding to an allosteric site on globular portions of a heavy chain dimer where it binds with greater affinity during muscle relaxation but with lesser affinity when the globular head binds with another contractile protein. What portion of the sarcomere shown below will have the greatest affinity of the substance during muscle contraction?\nOptions:\nA. I (represented on image as I band)\nB. II (represented on image as H band)\nC. III (represented on image as A band)\nD. IV (represented on image as Sarcomere)\nE. V (represented on image as M line)\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, II (represented on image as H band)\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A young infant is brought to an immunologist because of recurrent infections, which have not resolved despite appropriate medical treatment. On reviewing her medical history, the immunologist notes that the child has had frequent disseminated mycobacterial infections. He suspects a possible immunodeficiency. What is the most likely cause of this patient's immunodeficiency?\nOptions:\nA. B-cell maturation defect\nB. ATM gene defect\nC. LFA-1 integrin defect\nD. Interferon-gamma signaling defect\nE. BTK gene defect\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Interferon-gamma signaling defect\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 16-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a follow-up examination. He has a 6-year history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and his only medication is insulin. Seven months ago, he was treated for an episode of diabetic ketoacidosis. He has previously been compliant with his diet and insulin regimen. He wants to join the high school soccer team. Vital signs are within normal limits. His hemoglobin A1C is 6.3%. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation at this time?\nOptions:\nA. Advise against physical activity\nB. Lower insulin dosage on days of exercise\nC. Switch from insulin to metformin\nD. Increase insulin dosage on days of exercise\nE. Limit activity to 20 minutes per day\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Lower insulin dosage on days of exercise\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old girl comes to the emergency department because of left wrist pain and swelling for 5 hours. She fell on an outstretched hand while playing basketball. She ignored it initially as she thought it was just a bruise, but the pain and swelling worsened throughout the day. The analgesic spray she used did not provide adequate relief. There is no family history of serious illness. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive pill. Her immunizations are up-to-date. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg. Examination shows a swollen and tender left wrist; range of motion is limited. The anatomical snuffbox is tender to palpation. The grip strength of the left hand is decreased. The thumb can be opposed towards the other fingers. Finkelstein's test is negative. X-rays of the wrist shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Open reduction and internal fixation\nB. Corticosteroid injections\nC. Thumb spica cast and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks\nD. Rest, ice, and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks\nE. Percutaneous pinning\n\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Thumb spica cast and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a scaphoid fracture, which is a common injury that occurs when a person falls on an outstretched hand. The anatomical snuffbox is a region on the wrist that is tender to palpation in scaphoid fractures. The negative Finkelstein's test rules out de Quervain's tenosynovitis, which is another possible diagnosis.\n\nSince the X-rays do not show any abnormalities, the next step is to immobilize the wrist in a thumb spica cast and repeat the X-rays in 2 weeks to allow for any potential fracture to become visible. This is a common approach for suspected scaphoid fractures that are not visible on initial X-rays.",

She had a placental abruption and lost approximately 2000 ml of blood. During the procedure, she received two units of packed red blood cells and intravenous fluids. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She is sexually active with one male partner, and they use condoms inconsistently. She is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 94/58 mm Hg. Examination shows decreased sensation to temperature and pinprick below her waist and 0/5 muscle strength in her lower extremities. She feels the vibrations of a tuning fork placed on both of her great toes. Deep tendon reflexes are absent in the lower extremities and 2+ in the upper extremities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Tabes dorsalis\nB. Anterior spinal artery syndrome\nC. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome\nD. Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome\nE. Posterior spinal artery syndrome\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Anterior spinal artery syndrome\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks of gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. The patient has attended many prenatal appointments and followed her physician's advice about screening for diseases, laboratory testing, diet, and exercise. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. She has no history of a serious illness. Her first child was delivered via normal vaginal delivery. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Cervical examination shows 100% effacement and 10 cm dilation. A cardiotocograph is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Amnioinfusion\nB. Induced vaginal delivery\nC. Reassurance\nD. Repositioning\nE. Urgent cesarean delivery\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Repositioning.\n\nThe cardiotocograph (CTG) shows a non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern, specifically a variable deceleration. This can be caused by umbilical cord compression, which can be relieved by repositioning the mother. The initial step in management would be to reposition the mother to alleviate the compression and improve fetal oxygenation.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question. A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A 5-year-old child is brought to a pediatric clinic by his mother for a rash that started a few days ago. The mother adds that her son has also had a fever and sore throat since last week. His immunizations are up to date. On examination, a rash is present over the trunk and upper extremities and feels like sandpaper to touch. An oropharyngeal examination is suggestive of exudative pharyngitis with a white coat over the tongue. The physician swabs the throat and uses the swab in a rapid antigen detection test kit. He also sends the sample for microbiological culture. The physician then recommends empiric antibiotic therapy and tells the mother that if the boy is left untreated, the likelihood of developing a complication later in life is very high. Which of the following best explains the mechanism underlying the development of the complication the physician is talking about?\nOptions:\nA. Antigenic shift\nB. Bacterial tissue invasion\nC. Molecular mimicry\nD. Toxin-mediated cellular damage\nE. Genetic drift\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Molecular mimicry\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A previously healthy 2-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department because her lips turned blue while passing stools 30 minutes ago. She is at the 40th percentile for length and below the 35th percentile for weight. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 65%, which increases to 76% on administration of 100% oxygen. Physical examination shows perioral cyanosis and retractions of the lower ribs with respiration. Cardiac examination shows a harsh grade 2/6 systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border. Which of the following is most likely to improve this patient's symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Cooling of the face\nB. Elevation of the lower extremities\nC. Administration of indomethacin\nD. Hyperextension of the neck\nE. Knee to chest positioning\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Knee to chest positioning\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 24-year-old man presents to his family practitioner for routine follow-up of asthma. He is currently on albuterol, corticosteroids, and salmeterol, all via inhalation. The patient is compliant with his medications, but he still complains of episodic shortness of breath and wheezing. The peak expiratory flow (PEF) has improved since the last visit, but it is still less than the ideal predicted values based on age, gender, and height. Montelukast is added to his treatment regimen. What is the mechanism of action of this drug?\nOptions:\nA. Montelukast inhibits the release of inflammatory substances from mast cells.\nB. Montelukast binds to IgE.\nC. Montelukast activates adrenal receptors on the bronchial smooth muscles.\nD. Montelukast blocks receptors of some arachidonic acid metabolites.\nE. Montelukast inhibits lipoxygenase, thus decreasing the production of inflammatory leukotrienes.\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Montelukast blocks receptors of some arachidonic acid metabolites.\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 63-year-old female complains of weakness, light-headedness, palpitations, and soreness of the tongue. She has a past medical history of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis. Her hematocrit is 29%. On peripheral blood smear, you notice neutrophils with 7 lobes and large oval-shaped red blood cells. On physical exam, you notice the patient has decreased position sense and a loss in vibratory sensation in her lower extremities. Which of the following is most likely present in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Atrophy of G cells\nB. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies\nC. Decreased methylmalonic acid levels\nD. Antithrombotic state\nE. B12 malabsorption due to Diphyllobothrium latum\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: B, Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of pernicious anemia, a type of megaloblastic anemia caused by a deficiency of vitamin B12. The presence of neutrophils with 7 lobes and large oval-shaped red blood cells on the peripheral blood smear is consistent with megaloblastic anemia. The patient's history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and symptoms of weakness, light-headedness, palpitations, and soreness of the tongue also support this diagnosis. The presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies is a common finding in pernicious anemia, as they interfere with the absorption of vitamin B12.",

The pain comes in waves and radiates to his groin. Over the past year, he has had intermittent pain in the bilateral flanks and recurrent joint pain in the toes, ankles, and fingers. He has not seen a physician in over 10 years. He takes no medications. He drinks 3\u20135 beers daily. His sister has rheumatoid arthritis. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows marked tenderness bilaterally in the costovertebral areas. A photograph of the patient's left ear is shown. A CT scan of the abdomen shows multiple small kidney stones and a 7-mm left distal ureteral stone. A biopsy of the patient's external ear findings is most likely to show which of the following?\nOptions:\nA. Cholesterol\nB. Ammonium magnesium phosphate\nC. Monosodium urate\nD. Palisading granulomas\nE. Calcium oxalate\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Monosodium urate\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 61-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and repeated falls. Neurologic examination shows past-pointing on a finger-nose test. She has a broad-based gait. Ophthalmologic exam shows rhythmic leftward movement of the globes.

He admits that he has noticed himself flirting with some of the female co-workers at his new workplace. When he goes on a dinner date with his wife after work one evening, he accuses her of giving their waiter flirtatious looks and asks her whether she has been cheating on him or trying to spend time with other men. The man\u2019s actions are most consistent with which of the following psychological defense mechanisms?\nOptions:\nA. Displacement\nB. Dissociation\nC. Projection\nD. Reaction formation\nE. Repression\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Projection.\n\nThe man's actions, such as accusing his wife of flirting with the waiter and asking if she's been cheating on him, are a classic example of projection. Projection is a defense mechanism in which an individual attributes their own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else, often to avoid taking responsibility for their own actions or feelings. In this case, the man is projecting his own feelings of attraction to other women (as evidenced by his flirting with coworkers) onto his wife, accusing her of being unfaithful or interested in other men.",

Lithium\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Lithium\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 25-year-old, G2P2L2 woman presents with a complaint of missed menstrual cycle for 4 weeks. Her previous menstrual cycles were regular, occurring every 28\u201335 days consistently. The patient does not have any other complaints currently. Her past medical history reveals two uncomplicated and normal vaginal deliveries at term. She has a 2-year-old boy and a 6-month-old girl. The patient and her partner use the withdrawal method for contraception. The urine pregnancy test result is positive. The patient returns to the clinic after 1 week expressing her desire to discontinue with the pregnancy and inquires about the possibility of an elective abortion. Which of the following procedures is the most appropriate for elective termination of pregnancy in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Dilatation and evacuation (D&E)\nB. Oxytocin-induced labor\nC. Manual uterine aspiration\nD. Dilatation and curettage (D & C) after vacuum evacuation\nE. Oral mifepristone + misoprostol\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Manual uterine aspiration.\n\nManual uterine aspiration is a safe and effective method for elective termination of pregnancy up to 12 weeks of gestation. It is a minimally invasive procedure that involves using a handheld syringe to suction the contents of the uterus. This procedure is typically performed in an outpatient setting and is associated with a low risk of complications.\n\nDilatation and evacuation (D&E) is a more invasive procedure that is typically performed after 12 weeks of gestation. Oxytocin-induced labor is not a common method for elective termination of pregnancy. Dilatation and curettage (D&C) after vacuum evacuation is not necessary for a patient at 4 weeks of gestation. Oral mifepristone + misoprostol is a medical abortion regimen that is typically used up to 9 weeks of gestation, but it may not be the most appropriate option for this patient who is seeking a surgical termination.",

She has suffered from seasonal allergies for the past 2 years and takes diphenhydramine as needed when her symptoms worsen. She has not yet seen a physician for her allergies. She reports that diphenhydramine has been helpful in controlling her symptoms, but she does not like feeling drowsy from the medication. Her past medical history is also notable for well-controlled asthma. She uses an albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis. She smokes marijuana daily. Her temperature is 99.2\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 16/min. She has a prominent nasal crease. Her nasal turbinates are boggy and bluish-gray. She has copious thin and watery nasal mucus. The physician suggests replacing diphenhydramine with fexofenadine to improve her drowsiness. What characteristic of fexodenadine allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine?\nOptions:\nA. Alpha-adrenergic antagonism\nB. Beta-adrenergic antagonism\nC. Muscarinic antagonism\nD. Relative lipophobicity\nE. Serotonergic antagonism\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Relative lipophobicity.\n\nFexofenadine is a non-sedating antihistamine, which means it is less likely to cause drowsiness compared to diphenhydramine. This is due to its relative lipophobicity, which refers to its low ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. As a result, fexofenadine has a lower affinity for the central nervous system and is less likely to cause sedation.",

Order liver function tests\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Administer the hepatitis A vaccine\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 45-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a car accident with pain in the middle of his chest and some shortness of breath. He has sustained injuries to his right arm and leg. He did not lose consciousness. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. He is alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Examination shows several injuries to the upper extremities and chest. There are jugular venous pulsations 10 cm above the sternal angle. Heart sounds are faint on cardiac examination. The lungs are clear to auscultation. An ECG is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Contrast esophagram with gastrografin\nB. X-ray of the chest\nC. CT scan of the brain\nD. Contrast-enhanced CT angiography\nE. Transthoracic echocardiography\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Transthoracic echocardiography\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 56-year-old man recently diagnosed with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use presents to the clinic for a follow up evaluation. He states that he has abstained from alcohol and attends a support group regularly. He has not taken any new medications or encountered any sick contacts. The patient's blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 15/min. His physical exam is grossly unremarkable. He has brought an gastroduodenoscopy report for review, which reveals that the patient has small esophageal varices with red spots. What is the next best step to prevent bleeding?\nOptions:\nA. Endoscopic sclerotherapy\nB. Ligation\nC. Metoprolol\nD. Nadolol\nE. Repeat endoscopy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Nadolol.\n\nThe patient has small esophageal varices with red spots, which indicates a high risk of bleeding. Non-selective beta blockers, such as nadolol, are commonly used to prevent bleeding from esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. They work by reducing portal pressure and decreasing the risk of variceal bleeding.\n\nEndoscopic sclerotherapy (A) and ligation (B) are both used to treat bleeding varices, but they are not the next best step in preventing bleeding in this patient. Metoprolol (C) is a selective beta blocker that is not typically used for this indication. Repeating the endoscopy (E) may be necessary for surveillance, but it is not the next best step in preventing bleeding.",

Upon first inspection you note the man is drooling and his eyes are tearing excessively. The patient's wife explains that the man was tilling the fields on the family beet farm when she found him collapsed on a pile of freshly picked beets. The patient seemed confused so the wife brought him in promptly, and states it has only been ten minutes since the patient was found down in the fields. Physical exam is deferred due to a confused and combative patient who is speaking clearly yet his sentences do not make any sense. The patients clothes are removed in the ED. Vital signs are currently being obtained. Which of the following is the best initial step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Sublingual atropine drops\nB. Neostigmine\nC. Physostigmine\nD. 2-pralidoxime\nE. Intubation\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: A, Sublingual atropine drops\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms, including incomprehensible speech, drooling, and excessive tearing, are consistent with organophosphate poisoning, which is a common hazard in agricultural settings. The best initial step in management is to administer sublingual atropine drops to counteract the muscarinic effects of the organophosphate.",

He had been prescribed erythromycin in addition to his usual regimen of rosuvastatin and aspirin. With which potential side effect or interaction should the internist be most concerned?\nOptions:\nA. Gastric bleeding due to decreased aspirin metabolism in the presence of erythromycin\nB. Unstable angina due to decreased rosuvastatin metabolism in the presence of erythromycin\nC. Myalgia due to decreased rosuvastatin metabolism in the presence of erythromycin\nD. Metabolic acidosis due to decreased aspirin metabolism in the presence of erythromycin\nE. Tinnitus due to decreased aspirin metabolism in the presence of erythromycin\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Myalgia due to decreased rosuvastatin metabolism in the presence of erythromycin\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 75-year-old man presents to the physician for his annual blood pressure visit and blood work. He has no complaints other than occasional knee pain. The past medical history includes hypertension. He has had knee osteoarthritis for several years and takes occasional acetaminophen for pain control. His diet is full of vegetables. He exercises every day. He has no history of smoking. He had a brother who died at the age of 84 due to hematologic malignancy. The temperature is 36.8\u2103 (98.2\u2109), and the blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. The physical examination shows no abnormalities other than a reduced range of motion and crepitus in both knees. The laboratory test results are as follows:\nHemoglobin 15 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 58,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 250,000/mm3\nFlow cytometry on the peripheral blood reveals an absolute lymphocyte count of 50,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)\nB. Monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL)\nC. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)\nD. Multiple myeloma (MM)\nE. Polycythemia vera (PV)\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).\n\nThe patient's laboratory results show a significantly elevated leukocyte count (58,000/mm3) with a high absolute lymphocyte count (50,000/mm3). This suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder, and the most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, characterized by an abnormal increase in mature lymphocytes. The patient's age, lack of symptoms, and normal physical examination also support this diagnosis.\n\nMonoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a precursor condition to CLL, but it is typically characterized by a lower absolute lymphocyte count (<5,000/mm3). Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a condition characterized by the presence of a monoclonal protein in the blood, but it is not typically associated with an elevated leukocyte count. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow, but it is typically characterized by anemia, bone lesions, and an abnormal protein in the blood, which are not present in this patient. Polycythemia vera (PV) is a condition characterized by an overproduction of red blood cells, which is not consistent with the patient's laboratory results.",

Increasing carbohydrate intake, decreasing protein intake\nC. Decreasing carbohydrate intake, increasing fat intake\nD. Decreasing carbohydrate intake, increasing protein intake\nE. Decreasing fat intake, increasing protein intake\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Decreasing carbohydrate intake, increasing fat intake\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 2-year-old boy is brought in by his parents to his pediatrician. The boy was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 39 weeks and 5 days after a normal pregnancy. The boy has received all age-appropriate vaccinations as of his last visit at 18 months of age. Of note, the boy has confirmed sickle cell disease and the only medication he takes is penicillin prophylaxis. The parents state that they plan on enrolling their son in a daycare, which requires documentation of up-to-date vaccinations. The pediatrician states that their son needs an additional vaccination at this visit, which is a polysaccharide vaccine that is not conjugated to protein. Which of the following matches this description?\nOptions:\nA. Hib vaccine\nB. Live attenuated influenza vaccine\nC. Menactra\nD. Prevnar\nE. Pneumovax\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Pneumovax\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: During the third week of development, the blastula undergoes a variety of differentiation processes responsible for the formation of the gastrula and, eventually, the embryo. This differentiation creates cell lineages that eventually become a variety of body systems. What cell lineage, present at this date, is responsible for the formation of the liver?\nOptions:\nA. Syncytiotrophoblasts\nB. Endoderm\nC. Ectoderm\nD. Mesoderm\nE.

He has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. He is afebrile. Pulmonary examination shows inspiratory crackles at the left infraclavicular area. An x-ray of his chest shows a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning. A sputum sample does not grow acid-fast bacteria despite multiple cultures. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?\nOptions:\nA. Hypersensitivity reaction\nB. Asbestos inhalation\nC. Neoplastic transformation\nD. Opportunistic colonization\nE. Abscess formation\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Opportunistic colonization.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as coughing up yellow sputum with blood streaks, and the presence of a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning, suggest the presence of a lung lesion. The fact that the sputum sample does not grow acid-fast bacteria despite multiple cultures rules out active tuberculosis. The most likely cause of this patient's condition is opportunistic colonization, which means that the patient has a lung cavity or lesion that has become colonized by bacteria or fungi, leading to the symptoms and radiographic findings.",

He rejects his null hypothesis and concludes that low birth weight is associated with obesity. Which of the following statements best associates with his study?\nOptions:\nA. Confidence interval should have been 90%.\nB. A type 2 error is not possible in this case.\nC. Null hypothesis should not have been rejected.\nD. A type 2 error has been made.\nE. A type 1 error has been made.\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: E. A type 1 error has been made.\n\nExplanation: The researcher rejects the null hypothesis with a p-value of 0.049, which means there is a 4.9% chance of observing the result (or a more extreme result) assuming that the null hypothesis is true. This is below the typical significance level of 0.05, so the researcher concludes that there is a statistically significant association between low birth weight and obesity. However, this also means that there is a 4.9% chance of making a type 1 error, which is the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis. Therefore, the correct answer is E. A type 1 error has been made.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A 17-year-old girl comes to the urgent care center after testing negative for HIV. She recently had sexual intercourse for the first time and had used a condom with her long-term boyfriend. She has no personal history of serious illness and no history of sexually transmitted infections. However, the patient is still worried about the possibility she has HIV despite the negative HIV test. She states that the package insert of the HIV test shows that of 100 patients who are found to be HIV-positive on PCR, 91 tested positive via the HIV test. Later in the day, a 23-year-old woman with a history of genitourinary chlamydia infection also comes to the urgent care center after testing negative for HIV. She states that she recently had unprotected intercourse with \u201csomeone who might have HIV.\u201d If the test is conducted a second time on the 23-year-old patient, how will its performance compare to a second test conducted on the 17-year-old patient?\nOptions:\nA. Increased sensitivity\nB. Increased validity\nC. Increased specificity\nD. Decreased positive predictive value\nE. Decreased negative predictive value\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Decreased negative predictive value\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 32-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of worsening shortness of breath and a productive cough for 3 days. He sustained trauma to the right hemithorax during a fight 3 weeks ago. He had significant pain and mild shortness of breath following the incident but did not seek medical care. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. He is a construction worker. His temperature is 38.4\u00b0C (101.1\u00b0F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 120/75 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 96%. Pulmonary examination shows decreased breath sounds over the right lower lung fields. CT scan of the chest shows fractures of the right 7th and 8th ribs, right pleural splitting and thickening, and a dense fluid collection in the pleural space. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Viral pleurisy\nB. Lung abscess\nC. Chylothorax\nD. Pleural empyema\nE. Mesothelioma\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Pleural empyema\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A medical student is studying digestive enzymes at the brush border of the duodenum. He isolates and inactivates an enzyme in the brush border that has a high affinity for the pancreatic proenzyme trypsinogen. When the enzyme is inactivated, trypsinogen is no longer converted to its active form. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this enzyme?\nOptions:\nA. Conjugation of ubiquitin to lysine residue\nB. Phosphorylation of an amino acid side chain\nC. Attachment of a carbohydrate to a side chain\nD. Carboxylation of a glutamate residue\nE. Cleavage of a propeptide from an N-terminus\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Cleavage of a propeptide from an N-terminus\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 52-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for abdominal pain and diarrhea. The patient states that she has been experiencing watery diarrhea for weeks now. During this same period she states she has been constantly thirsty and does not have the same energy levels that she once had. The patient has a past medical history of anxiety and depression and is currently taking fluoxetine. She was recently treated for a middle ear infection and sinusitis with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid one week ago. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/58 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Laboratory values are obtained and shown below.\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 2.9 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 27 mEq/L\nBUN: 25 mg/dL\nGlucose: 99 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.4 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.2 mg/dL\nAST: 12 U/L\nALT: 10 U/L\n\nWhich of the following is associated with the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Enterotoxin\nB. Impaired iron absorption\nC. Increased serotonin production\nD. Invasive bacterial infection\nE. Normal flora destruction\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: E, Normal flora destruction\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms of watery diarrhea, thirst, and fatigue, along with laboratory values showing hypokalemia (low potassium levels) and a slightly elevated creatinine level, suggest a diagnosis of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, likely caused by Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infection. The recent use of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, has likely disrupted the normal gut flora, leading to an overgrowth of C. diff. This is supported by the option E, Normal flora destruction.",

You intend to discuss the results from his recent surveillance colonoscopy, which showed no remaining cancer, no polyps, and a well-healed anastmosis. During your meeting, you note that the patient is exhibiting the defense mechanism of suppression. Which of the following statements from the patient is consistent with your impression?\nOptions:\nA. \"Last week I volunteered for the local Cancer Society. Helping other cancer patients just makes me feel better.\"\nB. \"Oh, doctor, I'm just so grateful to be seeing you. I just know you've cured my cancer. I probably don't even need to check anymore.\"\nC. \"I'm sorry I was late today. I also didn't get any of the labs you asked for.\"\nD. \"Ever since I had the colonoscopy, I've been having headaches and backaches and just pain all over! I'm sure it's from the cancer.\"\nE. \"I really haven't thought about the colonoscopy until today. Worrying before getting the results wasn't going to help anything.\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. \"I really haven't thought about the colonoscopy until today. Worrying before getting the results wasn't going to help anything.\"\n\nSuppression is a defense mechanism in which an individual consciously pushes unpleasant or anxiety-provoking thoughts or feelings out of their awareness. The patient's statement in option E is consistent with suppression because they are acknowledging that they deliberately avoided thinking about the colonoscopy results until the appointment, implying that they were trying to avoid anxiety or worry.",

He reads a study that compares sputum testing results between 2,800 patients with likely active TB on a basis of history, clinical symptoms, and CXR pattern and 2,400 controls. The results are shown:\nSputum testing positive for TB Sputum testing negative for TB Total\nActive TB likely on basis of history, clinical symptoms, and CXR pattern 700 2100 2,800\nActive TB not likely on basis of history, clinical symptoms, and CXR pattern 300 2100 2,400\nTotal 1000 4200 5,200\nWhich of the following values reflects the probability that a patient with a diagnosis of active TB on the basis of history, clinical symptoms, and CXR pattern actually has active TB?\"\nOptions:\nA. 1.4\nB. 0.25\nC. 0.50\nD. 0.70\nE. 0.88\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, 0.25\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A previously healthy 36-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a progressively worsening headache for 5 days. She vomited twice after waking up this morning. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses an oral contraceptive. Her temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, and blood pressure is 125/80 mm Hg. Examination shows tearing of the right eye. The pupils are equal and reactive to light; right lateral gaze is limited. Fundoscopic examination shows bilateral optic disc swelling. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An MR venography of the head shows a heterogeneous intensity in the left lateral sinus. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Administer dalteparin\nB. Analyze cerebrospinal fluid\nC. Administer intravenous antibiotics\nD. Measure D-dimer levels\nE. Perform endovascular thrombolysis\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Administer dalteparin\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 55-year-old woman comes to the physician because of involuntary rhythmic shaking of both hands for several months. More recently, she also noticed involuntary head nodding movements. The shaking seems to improve after having one or two glasses of wine. Her father had similar symptoms starting at the age of 60. Neurologic examination shows a symmetric hand tremor that worsens with voluntary movement of the respective extremity. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms is also recommended for the treatment of which of the following conditions?\nOptions:\nA. Motion sickness\nB. Restless legs syndrome\nC. Sleepwalking\nD. Hyperthyroidism\nE. Malignant hyperthermia\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Hyperthyroidism\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with severe, crushing, retrosternal chest pain for the last 45 minutes. The pain radiates to his left shoulder and is associated with sweating. The past medical history is significant for hypercholesterolemia, for which he takes lovastatin. He smoked as a youth but quit at 40 years of age. On arrival at the emergency department, the vital signs were as follows: pulse 58/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and blood pressure 90/56 mm Hg. He is sweating profusely. The jugular venous pulse is visible 2.5 cm above the sternal angle. Auscultation reveals soft S1 and S2 heart sounds with an added S4 and bilateral inspiratory crackles at the lung bases. The electrocardiogram shows ST-elevations in leads V1 and V2. A diagnosis of an anteroseptal infarction is made. The patient was given aspirin on the way to the hospital. He is started on dopamine, morphine, nitroglycerin, and streptokinase. Which of the following would be the most concerning development over the next 24h this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Hemoptysis\nB. Easy fatigability\nC. Persistent ST-segment elevation\nD. Persistent inspiratory crackles\nE. Shortness of breath\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: C, Persistent ST-segment elevation\n\nExplanation: The patient is diagnosed with an anteroseptal infarction and is being treated with streptokinase, which is a thrombolytic agent. The goal of thrombolytic therapy is to restore blood flow to the affected area of the heart and reduce the size of the infarct. Persistent ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram would indicate that the thrombolytic therapy is not effective, and the infarct is not resolving, which would be a concerning development.",

Congenital renal hypoplasia\nE. Systemic lupus erythematosus\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Fibromuscular dysplasia\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 65-year-old male presents to his pulmonologist for a follow-up visit. He has a history of chronic progressive dyspnea over the past five years. He uses oxygen at home and was seen in the emergency room two months prior for an exacerbation of his dyspnea. He was discharged following stabilization. His past medical history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension. He drinks alcohol socially and has a 45 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 140/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 22/min. On examination, increased work of breathing is noted. The physician decides to start the patient on an additional medication that has both mucoactive and anti-oxidative properties. What is the primary mechanism of action of this medication in the lungs?\nOptions:\nA. DNA hydrolysis\nB. Disulfide bond cleavage\nC. Endothelin-1 antagonism\nD. Osmotic hydration of airway lumen\nE. Reduction in airway surface tension\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Disulfide bond cleavage.\n\nThe medication being described is likely N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which has mucoactive and anti-oxidative properties. NAC works by breaking down disulfide bonds in mucus, making it less viscous and easier to clear from the airways. This helps to improve lung function and relieve respiratory symptoms in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",

He applies some topical neomycin because he knows that it has antibiotic properties. As he is also in biology class, he decides to research the mechanism of action of neomycin and finds that it interferes with formation of the 30S initiation complex in bacteria. What is the messenger RNA (mRNA) signal recognized by the 30S ribosomal subunit necessary for the initiation of translation?\nOptions:\nA. Shine-Dalgarno sequence\nB. 5' methyl-guanosine cap\nC. Polyadenosine tail\nD. Kozak sequence\nE. UAA, UAG, and UGA codons\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Shine-Dalgarno sequence\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to a productive cough. His cough has been increasing in frequency and severity over the course of 3 days, and his sputum production has increased in volume. The color of his sputum is yellow-green. He denies any chest pain or palpitations but has experienced worsening shortness of breath with exertion and at rest, which is above his baseline. He has not noticed any changes in his weight or edema in his lower extremities. He denies any recent history of long travel. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been hospitalized four times for similar symptoms within the last year. He has smoked approximately 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 45 years. His temperature is 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/94 mmHg, pulse is 101/min, and respirations are 26/min with an oxygen saturation of 85% on room air. On physical exam, the patient has difficulty speaking, and there is asynchronous motion between the chest and abdomen with respiration. Wheezing is appreciated on pulmonary auscultation. An ECG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm. A chest radiograph is obtained, and he is administered supplemental oxygen. He is started on ipratropium, albuterol, and methylprednisolone. Which of the following should be added to this patient's treatment regimen?\nOptions:\nA. Amoxicillin\nB. Cefazolin\nC. Ceftriaxone\nD. Levofloxacin\nE. Penicillin\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: C. Ceftriaxone\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The yellow-green color of his sputum suggests a bacterial infection, and the patient's history of frequent hospitalizations for similar symptoms suggests that he may have a more severe infection. Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including those that commonly cause pneumonia, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. It is a reasonable addition to the patient's treatment regimen, which already includes bronchodilators and steroids.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: Before starting a new job at a law firm, a 33-year-old woman speaks to a representative about the health insurance plan offered by the firm. The representative explains that treatment is provided by primary health care physicians who focus on preventive care. Patients require a referral by the primary care physician for specialist care inside the network; treatment by health care providers outside the network is only covered in the case of an emergency. When the prospective employee asks how prices are negotiated between the health insurance company and the health care providers, the physician explains that the health care providers get a fixed payment for each patient enrolled over a specific period of time, regardless of whether or not services are provided. This arrangement best describes which of the following health care payment models?\nOptions:\nA. Per diem payment\nB. Bundled payment\nC. Fee-for-service\nD. Discounted fee-for-service\nE. Capitation\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Capitation\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 4-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of fever for the past 3 days. They also state that he has been less active and has been refusing to eat. The patient has had two episodes of bilateral otitis media since birth. He was born at term and had severe respiratory distress and sepsis shortly after birth that was treated with antibiotics. Umbilical cord separation occurred at the age of 33 days. The patient appears pale. Temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F), pulse is 170/min, and blood pressure is 60/40 mm Hg. He is at the 25th percentile for height and 15th percentile for weight. Examination shows a capillary refill time of 4 seconds. Oral examination shows white mucosal patches that bleed when they are scraped off. There is bilateral mucoid, nonpurulent ear discharge. Several scaly erythematous skin lesions are seen on the chest. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 38,700/mm3 with 90% neutrophils and a platelet count of 200,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Defective IL-2R gamma chain\nB. Defective beta-2 integrin\nC. Defective NADPH oxidase\nD. Defective lysosomal trafficking regulator gene\nE. WAS gene mutation\n\"\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Defective beta-2 integrin\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 32-year-old woman makes an appointment with her family physician for a new-employment physical examination. She has no complaints and the physical examination is unremarkable. The family history is negative for malignancies and inherited disorders. During the visit, she provides the results of a Pap smear taken last week, which reports the presence of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), along with a test for HPV, which was negative. The previous Pap smear was normal (negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancy). When would you recommend that she have another Pap smear?\nOptions:\nA. Immediately\nB. 6 months\nC. 3 years\nD. 5 years\nE. 1 year\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, 3 years\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 78-year-old woman presents to the office for an annual health check-up with her family physician accompanied by her daughter. She has no complaints during this visit but her daughter states that she is having difficulty locating objects such as the television remote, car keys, and her purse. Her medical history is significant for Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis and centrilobular emphysema. The patient takes memantine, atorvastatin, metformin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, aspirin, albuterol, and ipratropium. The patient\u2019s vitals are within normal limits today. Physical exam reveals an elderly female in no acute distress, oriented to person, place and year, but not to month or day of the week. She has a 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border along with an S3 gallop. There are mild crackles at the lung bases. The remainder of the exam is normal. A previous urine culture reports growth of > 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter. Urinalysis findings are offered below:\nLeukocyte esterase  positive\nWBCs 50-100 cell/HPF\nNitrites positive\nRBCs 2 cell/HPF\nEpithelial cells 2 cell/HPF\nUrine pH 5.7\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step?\nOptions:\nA. TMP-SMX\nB. Nitrofurantoin\nC. Levofloxacin\nD. Cephalexin\nE. No treatment is necessary\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Nitrofurantoin.\n\nThe patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) as evidenced by the positive leukocyte esterase, WBCs, and nitrites in the urinalysis. The presence of Enterobacter in the urine culture also supports this diagnosis. \n\nNitrofurantoin is a suitable antibiotic for treating UTIs, especially in elderly patients, as it is less likely to cause Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea and has a lower risk of selecting for resistant organisms. Additionally, it is effective against Enterobacter.\n\nTMP-SMX (A) is not a good choice due to the patient's age and the risk of hyperkalemia. Levofloxacin (C) is a fluoroquinolone that can cause tendon rupture and is not a first-line agent for UTIs in elderly patients. Cephalexin (D) is a cephalosporin that may not be effective against Enterobacter. No treatment is not necessary (E) because the patient has a UTI that requires antibiotic treatment.",

He has bilateral knee osteoarthritis and has used a walker for the past several years. For the past 6 months, he has experienced problems walking and maintaining balance and has been wheelchair-bound. He has fallen several times, hitting his head a few times but never losing consciousness. He complains of occasional difficulty remembering names and phone numbers, but his memory is otherwise fine. He also complains of occasional incontinence. Physical examination reveals a slow wide-based gait with small steps and intermittent hesitation. He scores 22 out of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). A brain MRI demonstrates dilated ventricles with high periventricular fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal. A large-volume lumbar puncture improves his gait. Which of the following is the most likely risk factor for the development of this condition?\nOptions:\nA. Alzheimer\u2019s disease\nB. Diabetes mellitus\nC. Epilepsy\nD. Hypertension\nE. Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 65-year-old man comes to the physician because of abdominal pain and bloody, mucoid diarrhea for 3 days. He has been taking over-the-counter supplements for constipation over the past 6 months. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 15 years ago. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. His current medications include metformin. His temperature is 38.4\u00b0C (101.1\u00b0F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 134/82 mm Hg. Examination of the abdomen shows no masses. Palpation of the left lower abdomen elicits tenderness. A CT scan of the abdomen is shown. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition?\nOptions:\nA. Focal weakness of the colonic muscularis layer\nB. Infiltrative growth in the descending colon\nC. Transmural inflammation of the terminal ileum\nD. Twisting of the sigmoid colon around its mesentery\nE.

Over the past 2 months, she has had increasing fatigue and difficulties concentrating. She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and was started on a new medication 4 months ago. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes and three tender ulcerative lesions in her mouth. Her hemoglobin concentration is 8.7 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume is 109 \u03bcm3. A blood smear shows hypersegmented neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?\nOptions:\nA. Deficient heme synthesis\nB. Deficient DNA crosslink repair\nC. Deficient erythropoietin secretion\nD. Deficient nitrogenous base production\nE. Deficient \u03b2-globin chains\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Deficient nitrogenous base production.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including painful mouth ulcers, fatigue, and difficulties concentrating, are consistent with a deficiency in nitrogenous bases, such as folate or vitamin B12. The laboratory findings, including a low hemoglobin concentration, high mean corpuscular volume, and hypersegmented neutrophils on the blood smear, also support this diagnosis. The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and recent initiation of a new medication 4 months ago suggests that the medication may be causing a deficiency in folate or vitamin B12, leading to the patient's symptoms.",

Her parents note that she was diagnosed with a heart murmur, but it was never treated. Physical examination reveals a small child in distress. She is laying on the examination table with her knees drawn to her chest. Cardiac auscultation reveals a harsh, systolic ejection murmur that is best heard at the upper left sternal border. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Tetralogy of Fallot\nB. Transposition of great vessels\nC. Pulmonary hypoplasia\nD. Atrial septal defect\nE. Patent ductus arteriosus\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Tetralogy of Fallot.\n\nThe symptoms described, such as irritability, pallor, and cyanosis (blue discoloration), are consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect. The harsh, systolic ejection murmur heard at the upper left sternal border is also characteristic of this condition. Tetralogy of Fallot is a combination of four heart defects: ventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. This condition can cause cyanosis and other symptoms described in the question.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A 19-year-old male college student is admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit with a chief complaint of \u201cthoughts about killing my girlfriend.\u201d The patient explains that throughout the day he becomes suddenly overwhelmed by thoughts about strangling his girlfriend and hears a voice saying \u201ckill her.\u201d He recognizes the voice as his own, though it is very distressing to him. After having such thoughts, he feels anxious and guilty and feels compelled to tell his girlfriend about them in detail, which temporarily relieves his anxiety. He also worries about his girlfriend dying in various ways but believes that he can prevent all of this from happening and \u201ckeep her safe\u201d by repeating prayers out loud several times in a row. The patient has no personal history of violence but has a family history of psychotic disorders. He has been on haloperidol and fluoxetine for his symptoms in the past but neither was helpful. In addition to psychotherapy, which of the following medications is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Alprazolam\nB. Amitriptyline\nC. Buspirone\nD. Clomipramine\nE. Quetiapine\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Clomipramine\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 32-year-old man and his wife are sent to a fertility specialist after trying to conceive for several years without success. They have had unprotected sex several times a week. He has no history of a serious illness and does not take any medications. There are no concerns about his libido or erections. His female partner is not on contraceptive medication and has a child from a previous marriage. At the clinic, his vitals are normal. Examination of the scrotum on the right side is normal, but on the left side there are many deep and superficial ducts or vessels that feels like a bag of worms on palpation. The lesion is more apparent when the patient bears down. Semen analysis shows a low sperm count with poor motility and an increased percentage of abnormal sperms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection\nB. Ligation of processus vaginalis\nC. Microsurgical varicocelectomy\nD. Pulsatile GNRH\nE. No therapy at this time\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Microsurgical varicocelectomy\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 53-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit from the emergency department with severe pancreatitis. Overnight, he starts to develop severe hypoxemia, and he is evaluated by a rapid response team. On exam the patient is breathing very quickly and has rales and decreased breath sounds bilaterally. He is placed on 50% FiO2, and an arterial blood gas is collected with the following results:\n\npH: 7.43\npCO2: 32 mmHg\npO2: 78 mmHg\n\nThe oxygen status of the patient continues to deteriorate, and he is placed on ventilator support.

Large clot in pulmonary artery\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Intra-alveolar hyaline membrane formation\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 60-year-old man presents to his local walk-in clinic with 1 week of fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, malaise, progressive shortness of breath, and sharp chest pain. He is found with a blood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, a heart rate of 84/min, an elevated respiratory rate, and a holosystolic heart murmur III/VI. His palms and soles show non-tender erythematous lesions. His personal medical history is relevant for frequent visits to the ER for lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the last month with a recent colonoscopy that reported an ulcerative lesion suggestive of colorectal cancer. He has not been subjected to dental procedures recently, and he denies the use of psychoactive drugs. A chest plain film shows clear lungs and mild cardiomegaly, and echocardiography reports the presence of vegetations involving the mitral valve. Which of the following organisms is the most likely causative agent?\nOptions:\nA. Kingella kingae\nB. Staphylococcus aureus\nC. Escherichia coli\nD. Haemophilus aphrophilus\nE. Streptococcus bovis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Streptococcus bovis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including fever, chills, night sweats, and shortness of breath, are consistent with endocarditis. The presence of a holosystolic heart murmur and vegetations on the mitral valve on echocardiography support this diagnosis. The patient's recent history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding and colonoscopy findings suggestive of colorectal cancer are also relevant.\n\nStreptococcus bovis is a type of bacteria that is commonly associated with endocarditis, particularly in patients with underlying gastrointestinal malignancies. It is known to cause endocarditis in patients with colon cancer, and the patient's symptoms and echocardiography findings are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nThe other options are less likely causes of endocarditis in this patient. Kingella kingae is a rare cause of endocarditis, and Staphylococcus aureus is more commonly associated with skin and soft tissue infections. Escherichia coli is a common cause of urinary tract infections, but it is less likely to cause endocarditis. Haemophilus aphrophilus is a rare cause of endocarditis, and it is more commonly associated with respiratory tract infections.",

Which of the following statements best describes this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. This patient's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is more than 5.\nB. Episodes of apnea and hypopnea are more likely to occur during deeper stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep.\nC. Mouth opening during sleep breaks the seal between the tongue and the teeth and relieves airway obstruction.\nD. The most common site of a collapse of pharyngeal airway during sleep apnea is at the level of the base of the tongue.\nE. Gynoid obesity is associated with apnea and hypopnea more frequently as compared to android obesity.\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: A. This patient's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is more than 5.\n\nExplanation: The patient's overnight polysomnogram records 12 episodes of apnea and 30 episodes of hypopnea during a 7-hour sleep. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is a measure of the severity of sleep apnea, and it is calculated by adding the number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep. In this case, the AHI would be (12 + 30) / 7 = 6. This is more than 5, which is the threshold for diagnosing sleep apnea.",

Small airway wall thickness\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: D, Radial traction on airway wall\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest pulmonary fibrosis, which is supported by the chest X-ray image. The presence of digital clubbing and bilateral basilar fine crackles on pulmonary auscultation are consistent with this diagnosis. The increased expiratory flow rate in this patient is likely due to radial traction on airway walls, which is a characteristic feature of pulmonary fibrosis. In pulmonary fibrosis, the lung tissue becomes scarred and stiff, leading to increased radial traction on airway walls, which can cause airways to remain open and allow for increased expiratory flow rates.",

Primary syphilis\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: The first 24 hours after delivery, a 2888 g (6.37 lb) male newborn is not feeding well, has a high-pitched cry, and is diaphoretic. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation to a 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, after an uncomplicated labor and delivery. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother did not receive prenatal care. She takes codeine syrup frequently for dry cough. The infant's temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 165/min, and blood pressure is 83/50 mm Hg. Examination shows hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. The baby is swaddled to prevent excoriations, and fluid resuscitation is initiated. Complete blood count and serum levels of glucose, bilirubin, and calcium are within normal limits. What is the most appropriate next step in treatment of this newborn?\nOptions:\nA. Oral morphine therapy\nB. Oral clonidine therapy\nC. Intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin combination therapy\nD. Oral methimazole therapy\nE. Dextrose infusion\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Oral morphine therapy.\n\nThe symptoms described in the question, such as high-pitched cry, diaphoresis, hyperreflexia, tremors, and excessive startle response, are consistent with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS occurs in newborns exposed to opioids in utero, and the mother's frequent use of codeine syrup during pregnancy suggests that the baby may have been exposed to opioids. Morphine therapy is often used to treat NAS, and it is the most appropriate next step in treatment for this newborn.",

His wife divorced him about 6 months ago and took the kids and moved out of state. Since then he has had difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time. He takes some comfort in food and has gained about 9.1 kg (20 lb). He eats out several times a week and sometimes consumes 2 whole meals in one sitting. Other than this new obsession with eating large quantities of food and excess sleeping he no longer enjoys doing things he liked doing in the past. Besides eating and sleeping he is always excited to see his children and looks forward to their visits. He says it's the one thing keeping him going. Additionally, he does not feel like he has the same drive or focuses at work. He reports that he has no interest in hurting himself or others. His blood pressure is 119/81 mm Hg, pulse rate is 85/min, respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F). His physical exam is normal. What other symptom is most likely present in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Leaden paralysis\nB. Depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning\nC. Psychotic features\nD. Stereotypies\nE. Mania\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: B. Depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms, such as feeling sad and depressed, difficulty waking up in the morning, and loss of interest in activities, are consistent with major depressive disorder. One of the common symptoms of depression is diurnal variation, where symptoms are worse in the morning and improve as the day progresses. This is likely to be present in this patient, given his difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time.",

Umbilical cord prolapse\nB. Umbilical cord compression\nC. Physiologic fetal heart rate pattern\nD. Placental insufficiency\nE. Chorioamnionitis\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Placental insufficiency\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after coughing up copious amounts of blood-tinged sputum at his nursing home. He recently had an upper respiratory tract infection that was treated with antibiotics. He has a long-standing history of productive cough that has worsened since he had a stroke 3 years ago. He smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years until the stroke, after which he quit. The patient appears distressed and short of breath. His temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 145/85 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 92%. Physical examination shows digital clubbing and cyanosis of the lips. Coarse crackles are heard in the thorax. An x-ray of the chest shows increased translucency and tram-track opacities in the right lower lung field. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Bronchiectasis\nB. Aspiration pneumonia\nC. Emphysema\nD. Pulmonary embolism\nE. Lung cancer\n\"\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Bronchiectasis\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: On a medical trip to Nicaragua, you observe a sweet odor in the cerumen of 12-hour female newborn. Within 48 hours, the newborn develops ketonuria, poor feeding, and a sweet odor is also noticed in the urine. By 96 hours, the newborn is extremely lethargic and opisthotonus is observed. In order to prevent a coma and subsequent death, which of the following amino acids should be withheld from this newborn's diet?\nOptions:\nA. Phenylalanine\nB. Valine\nC. Tyrosine\nD. Methionine\nE. Threonine\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Valine\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with acute shortness of breath that developed after a 10-hour international flight. His pulse is 124/min and pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 90%. He weighs 50-kg (110-lb). A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is suspected and intravenous heparin is initiated. If the volume of distribution of heparin is equivalent to 60 mL/kg and the target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL, which of the following is the most appropriate loading dose for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. 3,000 units\nB. 1,500 units\nC. 6,000 units\nD. Cannot be calculated, as bioavailability is not known\nE. 30 units\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: B, 1,500 units\n\nExplanation: To calculate the loading dose of heparin, we need to know the volume of distribution (Vd) and the target peak plasma concentration (Cp). The formula to calculate the loading dose is:\n\nLoading dose = Vd x Cp\n\nGiven values:\nVd = 60 mL/kg\nCp = 0.5 units/mL\nPatient's weight = 50 kg\n\nFirst, calculate the volume of distribution in mL:\nVd (mL) = 60 mL/kg x 50 kg = 3000 mL\n\nNow, calculate the loading dose:\nLoading dose = Vd x Cp = 3000 mL x 0.5 units/mL = 1500 units\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate loading dose for this patient is 1500 units.",

A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 5-day history of a rash on his chest and back. His mother initially noticed only a few lesions on his back, but since then the rash has spread to his chest. His family returned from a trip to the Caribbean 2 weeks ago. His mother started using a new laundry detergent 8 days ago. He has type 1 diabetes mellitus controlled with insulin. His mother has Hashimoto thyroiditis and his brother has severe facial acne. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 81/min, and blood pressure is 115/74 mm Hg. Examination of the skin shows multiple, nontender, round, white macules on the chest and trunk. There is fine scaling when the lesions are scraped with a spatula. There are no excoriation marks. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Autoimmune destruction of melanocytes\nB. Increased sebum production\nC. Increased growth of Malassezia globosa\nD. Exposure to human herpes virus 7\nE. Antigen uptake by Langerhans cells\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Increased growth of Malassezia globosa\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: An investigator is studying the structural integrity of collagen. Human fibroblasts are cultured on a medium and different enzymes are applied. One of the cultures is supplemented with an enzyme that inhibits the formation of hydrogen and disulfide bonds between collagen \u03b1-chains. Which of the following processes is most likely to be impaired as a result?\nOptions:\nA. Bone matrix synthesis\nB. Ligament relaxation\nC. Osteoclast activation\nD. Internal elastic lamina formation\nE. Cartilaginous growth plate mineralization\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Bone matrix synthesis\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department with sudden-onset severe pain in the right shoulder that occurred when he threw a bowling ball 2 hours ago. He has a history of dislocations in both shoulders and subluxation of the right knee and left wrist. There is no history of fractures. On physical examination, the right arm is slightly abducted and externally rotated. An anterior bulge is seen near the shoulder joint. The neurovascular examination of the right arm shows no abnormalities. The skin examination shows multiple widened atrophic scars around the knees, elbows, and ankles. The skin of the neck and around the elbow can easily be extended up to 4 cm. The sclera is white. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. A defect in which of the following proteins is the most likely cause of the findings in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Collagen\nB. Elastin\nC. Fibrillin-1\nD. Keratin\nE. Tau\n\nCorrect Answer is: A, Collagen\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 45-year-old man presents to a surgeon with painless swelling over his right leg. He noticed the swelling 6 months ago, but he ignored it because it was painless. However, he is now concerned as the swelling has been increasing in size over the last 6 months. He also mentions that his father and brother have lipomas over the extremities. On physical examination, the swelling is well-circumscribed and non-tender, measuring approximately 4 x 5 cm. After evaluation, the surgeon performs a surgical resection of the tumor and sends the tissue for histopathological examination. The pathologist reports the tumor to be a liposarcoma rather than a lipoma. Which of the following enzymes is most likely to show increased activity in the cells of this patient\u2019s tumor?\nOptions:\nA. Alkaline phosphatase\nB. DNase\nC. RNase\nD. Superoxide dismutase\nE. Telomerase\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: E. Telomerase\n\nExplanation: Liposarcoma is a type of cancer that arises from adipocytes (fat cells). Telomerase is an enzyme that helps to maintain the length of telomeres, which are the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes. Cancer cells, including those in liposarcoma, often have increased telomerase activity to maintain their ability to divide indefinitely. This is in contrast to normal cells, which have limited telomerase activity and eventually reach senescence due to telomere shortening.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question. A few examples are provided.\nQuery: Example 1:\nQuestion: A cross-sectional oral health survey was designed to assess both functional and psychosocial effects of dental disease on the elderly population of Buda, Texas (US). Printed surveys that consisted of 50 open-ended questions on dental disease history and dental hygiene were mailed to the selected members of a target population. However, the response rate was not satisfactory, as a large percentage of the selected study participants either did not return the survey or failed to answer all of the questions posed. The researchers opted for 2 strategies: prompt those who did not respond with a second letter that guaranteed complete confidentiality and broaden the pool of selected participants. Depending on the final response rate and the researchers\u2019 statistical skills, the bias in the final publication will be more pronounced if...?\nOptions:\nA. ....the proportion of nonrespondents from the targeted sample is decreased.\nB. ...the specific weighting-class adjustments are used on the final data.\nC. ...the difference between the observed and nonrespondent answers is increased.\nD. ...the auxiliary population variables are introduced by means of a calibration method.\nE. ...the imputation techniques for data correction are employed.\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, ...the difference between the observed and nonrespondent answers is increased.\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 68-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because she is concerned about his speech being irregular. Specifically, she says that over the last 8 months, her husband has been saying increasingly nonsensical statements at home. In addition, he is no longer able to perform basic verbal tasks such as ordering from a menu or giving directions even though he was an English teacher prior to retirement. She also reports that he has recently started attempting to kiss strangers and urinate in public. Finally, she has also noticed that he has been frequently binge eating sweets even though he was previously very conscientious about his health. When asked about these activities, the patient does not have insight into his symptoms. Which of the following would most likely be seen in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Alpha-synuclein\nB. Intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau proteins\nC. Hyperphosphorylated tau inclusion bodies\nD. Large intracellular vacuoles\nE. Perivascular inflammation\n\nCorrect Answer is: C, Hyperphosphorylated tau inclusion bodies\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 45-year-old man presents to the physician with limb weakness over the last 24 hours. He is an otherwise healthy man with no significant past medical history. On physical examination, his vital signs are stable. On neurological examination, there is decreased strength in the muscles of all 4 extremities, and the deep tendon reflexes are depressed. A detailed laboratory evaluation shows that he has generalized decreased neuronal excitability due to an electrolyte imbalance. Which of the following electrolyte imbalances is most likely to be present in the man?\nOptions:\nA. Acute hyperkalemia\nB. Acute hypercalcemia\nC. Acute hypomagnesemia\nD. Acute hypernatremia\nE. Acute hypochloremia\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Acute hypercalcemia\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 24-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a wellness visit. She says that she has been generally healthy but has noticed difficulty concentrating, becoming increasingly fatigued, and a 15-pound weight increase over the course of a few months. She also reports mild constipation and joint pain. Approximately 6-months ago, she experienced palpitations, increased stool frequency, and a hand tremor. Her past medical history is significant for asthma. Her father is not living and had Parkinson disease, and her mother has poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. She is currently sexually active in a monogamous relationship and uses contraception consistently. She denies cigarette smoking and occasionally drinks wine. She experimented once with lysergic acid diethylamide 6 years ago. Her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 127/98 mmHg, pulse is 55/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, the patient has slow speech and movement. She has tenderness to palpation of her wrist and ankle joints. She has delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following will most likely be found in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Elevated TSH\nB. High Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score\nC. Improved symptoms with carbidopa/levodopa administration\nD. Positive anti-CCP antibodies\nE. Positive urine toxicology\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: A. Elevated TSH\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms, such as difficulty concentrating, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, joint pain, and slow speech and movement, are consistent with hypothyroidism. The delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes is also a characteristic finding in hypothyroidism. The patient's previous symptoms of palpitations, increased stool frequency, and hand tremor 6 months ago may have been indicative of hyperthyroidism, but the current symptoms suggest a transition to hypothyroidism. Elevated TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels would confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.",

Complete atrioventricular septal defect\nD. Atrial septal defect\nE. Double-outlet right ventricle with subaortic ventricular septal defect\n\nCorrect Answer is: D, Atrial septal defect\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A 30-year-old woman presents to the clinic for a 3-month history of painful hair loss. She was in her usual state of health until about 3 months ago when she started to develop some painfully itchy spots across her scalp. Since that time these spots have lost hair and scarred, with new spots continuing to form. On further questioning, she shares that, for the last couple of years, she has generally felt poorly, specifically noting intermittent fevers, muscle and joint pains, and fatigue. On physical exam, she has several erythematous and scaly plaques across her scalp. These areas have no hair growth, but some do demonstrate hyperpigmentation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Alopecia areata\nB. Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE)\nC. Secondary syphilis\nD. Tinea capitis\nE. Trichotillomania\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE)\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A 25-year-old woman comes to the emergency department one hour after the sudden onset of diffuse abdominal pain and nausea. She has no history of serious illness. Menses occur at regular 27-day intervals and last 4 to 6 days with moderate flow. Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago. She is sexually active with two sexual partners and uses oral contraceptive pills inconsistently. She appears pale and diaphoretic. Her temperature is 37.7\u00b0C (99.9\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 85/70 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows diffuse abdominal tenderness. Pelvic examination shows a normal appearing vagina, cervix, and uterus, with right adnexal tenderness. Her hemoglobin concentration is 13 g/dL, leukocyte count is 10,000/mm3, and platelet count is 350,000/mm3. Results of a pregnancy test are pending.

Perform CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast\nD. Transfuse O negative packed red blood cells\nE. Perform pelvic ultrasound\n\nCorrect Answer is: B, Administer intravenous normal saline fluids\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 3466-g (7-lb, 10-oz) female newborn is delivered at 38 weeks' gestation to a 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1. Apgar scores are 7 and 8, at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother has a history of schizophrenia and was treated with lithium until 5 weeks' gestation, when she found out that she was pregnant. The mother was treated for alcohol abuse disorder 2 years ago. She has been sober for 14 months now. Examination shows that the child has micrognathia, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, and small, low-set ears. Examination of the mouth shows a cleft palate. A grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur can be heard over the left sternal border. Echocardiography shows a single overriding great vessel arising from the heart. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?\nOptions:\nA. Low levels of parathyroid hormone in serum\nB. Double bubble sign on abdominal x-ray\nC. Chromosome 5p deletion on FISH studies\nD. Elongated tricuspid valve leaflets on echocardiography\nE. Bilateral cataracts on ocular examination\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: C. Chromosome 5p deletion on FISH studies\n\nExplanation: The newborn's physical features, such as micrognathia, broad nasal bridge, short philtrum, small and low-set ears, and cleft palate, are consistent with a diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome). The presence of a single overriding great vessel arising from the heart on echocardiography also supports this diagnosis. DiGeorge syndrome is often associated with a deletion of chromosome 22q11.2, which can be confirmed by FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) studies.",

He understands that these molecules are proteins, but the structures of class I MHC molecules are different from those of class II. Although all these molecules consist of \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains, some of their domains are polymorphic, meaning they are different in different individuals. He calls them \u2018P\u2019 domains. The other domains are nonpolymorphic, which remain invariant in all individuals. He calls these domains \u2018N\u2019 domains. Which of the following are examples of \u2018N\u2019 domains?\nOptions:\nA. \u03b22-microglobulin in class I molecules and \u03b21 domain in class II molecules\nB. \u03b11 domain in class I molecules and \u03b11 domain in class II molecules\nC. \u03b12 domain in class I molecules and \u03b22 domain in class II molecules\nD. \u03b11-\u03b12 domains in class I molecules and \u03b11-\u03b21 domains in class II molecules\nE. \u03b13 domain in class I molecules and \u03b22 domain in class II molecules\n\nCorrect Answer is: E, \u03b13 domain in class I molecules and \u03b22 domain in class II molecules\n\nNow, answer the following question:\n\nQuestion: A 25-year-old girl is brought to the emergency room after a suicide attempt. Her mother states that she found a large empty pill bottle next to her. The patient is conscious and tearful. She is currently complaining of severe abdominal pain but refuses to give any other history. She has a blood pressure of 135/86, respiratory rate of 18/min, and heart rate of 86/min. On examination, her abdomen is exquisitely tender with evidence of crepitus in the epigastric region. Abdominal CT reveals a gastric perforation. Which of the following is the most likely cause?\nOptions:\nA. Decreased production of PGE2\nB. Buildup of a toxic metabolite due to kidney disease\nC. Increased stimulation of the vagus nerve\nD. Direct irritation of the stomach lining causing inflammation\nE. Hypovolemia\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: D, Direct irritation of the stomach lining causing inflammation\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, tenderness, and crepitus in the epigastric region, suggest a gastric perforation. The most likely cause of this is direct irritation of the stomach lining causing inflammation, which is consistent with a suicide attempt by ingesting a large quantity of pills. The pills likely caused a chemical burn to the stomach lining, leading to perforation.",

His blood pressure is 157/90 mmHg and his his pulse is 116/min. He appears anxious and agitated and a careful exam reveals dilated pupils and a perforated nasal septum. An EKG reveals ST segment elevation so he is urgently taken for cardiac intervention. Upon review, this patient reveals that he has not had care from a physician since he graduated from college. In the interim he has been largely unemployed and admits that he has recently been homeless. When asked directly, the patient admits to alcohol and marijuana use but denies illicit drug use. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the agent most likely responsible for this patient's presentation?\nOptions:\nA. Blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine\nB. Inhibiting breakdown of biogenic amines\nC. Antagonizing the NMDA receptor\nD. Activating the acetylcholine receptor\nE. Inhibiting the GABA receptor\n\nResponse: Correct Answer is: A. Blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine\n\nExplanation: The patient's symptoms, such as dilated pupils, anxiety, agitation, and ST segment elevation on EKG, are consistent with a sympathomimetic overdose. The patient's history of being homeless and unemployed, as well as his admission to substance abuse, suggests that he may have used illicit drugs, despite his denial. The most likely agent responsible for this patient's presentation is cocaine, which works by blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, leading to an increase in sympathetic activity and the observed symptoms.",

Specifically, they have noticed that he has been exhibiting aggressive behavior as well as hyperactivity. In addition, he has had intellectual disability and is slow to hit developmental milestones. Physical exam reveals coarse facies, short stature, and joint stiffness. Eye exam reveals no abnormalities of the cornea or lens. Based on these findings, the patient is referred to a geneticist for further evaluation. Which of the following substances would most likely accumulate in the cells of this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Cerebroside sulfate\nB. Galactocerebroside\nC. Glucocerebroside\nD. Heparan sulfate\nE. Sphingomyelin\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Heparan sulfate.\n\nThe symptoms described in the question, such as aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, intellectual disability, coarse facies, short stature, and joint stiffness, are consistent with Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), a group of lysosomal storage disorders. The accumulation of heparan sulfate, a type of glycosaminoglycan, is a hallmark of MPS.\n\nMPS is caused by a deficiency of enzymes involved in the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans, leading to their accumulation in cells. The specific type of MPS that matches the symptoms described is likely to be MPS I (Hurler syndrome), which is characterized by the accumulation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the symptoms described:\n\nA. Cerebroside sulfate is a type of glycolipid that accumulates in metachromatic leukodystrophy, a different lysosomal storage disorder.\n\nB. Galactocerebroside is a type of glycolipid that accumulates in Krabbe disease, a different lysosomal storage disorder.\n\nC. Glucocerebroside is a type of glycolipid that accumulates in Gaucher disease, a different lysosomal storage disorder.\n\nE.

Papillary carcinoma\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Papillary carcinoma.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as a painless mass in the neck that has been slowly growing, and the physical exam findings, such as a solitary nodule that is fixed to the surrounding tissues and nontender, are consistent with a thyroid cancer, specifically papillary carcinoma. The normal TSH and negative antithyroid antibodies rule out other thyroid-related conditions such as Graves' disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis. Endemic goiter is a condition caused by iodine deficiency, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Follicular carcinoma is a type of thyroid cancer, but it is less likely to present with a fixed nodule.",
