He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?\nOptions:\nA. Disclose the error to the patient but leave it out of the operative report\nB. Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report\nC. Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake\nD. Report the physician to the ethics committee\nE. Refuse to dictate the operative report\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report.\n\nAs a healthcare professional, it is essential to maintain transparency and honesty with patients, even when mistakes occur. Failing to disclose the error to the patient and omitting it from the operative report is unethical and can lead to mistrust and potential harm to the patient.\n\nThe resident should disclose the error to the patient in a compassionate and honest manner, explaining what happened, how it was repaired, and what steps will be taken to prevent similar errors in the future. Additionally, the resident should ensure that the operative report accurately reflects the events of the surgery, including the complication and its repair.\n\nOptions A, C, D, and E are not correct because:\n\nA. Disclosing the error to the patient but leaving it out of the operative report is incomplete and unethical.\n\nC. Telling the attending that he cannot fail to disclose the mistake may lead to conflict, but it does not address the primary issue of patient disclosure and accurate reporting.\n\nD. Reporting the physician to the ethics committee may be premature and may not address the immediate need for patient disclosure and accurate reporting.\n\nE.

He received this first course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 week ago. Pure tone audiometry shows a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB. The expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to which of the following actions?\nOptions:\nA. Inhibition of thymidine synthesis\nB. Inhibition of proteasome\nC. Hyperstabilization of microtubules\nD. Generation of free radicals\nE. Cross-linking of DNA\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Hyperstabilization of microtubules.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, specifically the ringing sensation in the ear (tinnitus) and sensorineural hearing loss, are consistent with ototoxicity, a known side effect of certain chemotherapeutic agents. The most likely culprit is cisplatin, a platinum-based chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.\n\nCisplatin's mechanism of action involves forming cross-links with DNA, which is option E. However, this is not the correct answer because the question asks about the expected beneficial effect of the drug, not the mechanism of ototoxicity.\n\nThe correct answer, option C, refers to the mechanism of action of taxanes, a class of chemotherapy drugs that includes paclitaxel and docetaxel. These drugs work by hyperstabilizing microtubules, which leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (programmed cell death). While taxanes are not typically used to treat bladder cancer, they are used to treat other types of cancer, and their mechanism of action is distinct from that of cisplatin.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the mechanism of action of cisplatin:\n\nA. Inhibition of thymidine synthesis is a mechanism of action of antimetabolite chemotherapy drugs, such as methotrexate.\n\nB. Inhibition of proteasome is a mechanism of action of proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib.\n\nD. Generation of free radicals is a mechanism of action of some chemotherapy drugs, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or the mechanism of action of cisplatin.",

After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection. Which of the following viruses is capable of undergoing the above-mentioned process?\nOptions:\nA. Cytomegalovirus\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Human immunodeficiency virus\nD. Rotavirus\nE.

Rotaviruses have a segmented genome, consisting of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA. When a host cell is co-infected with two different rotaviruses, the genome segments from each virus can reassort and combine in new ways, resulting in the formation of novel virus particles with unique genetic compositions. This process can lead to the emergence of new strains of rotavirus.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Cytomegalovirus and B.

He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen. Which of the following mediators is described in this experimental study?\nOptions:\nA. IL-5\nB. IL-2\nC. IL-10\nD. IL-13\nE. IL-4\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. IL-4.\n\nThe description in the question suggests that the experimental therapy targets a mediator that promotes class switching of antibodies, which is a key feature of IL-4.

Ibuprofen is used to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms, while colchicine is used to reduce the risk of recurrent pericarditis. Omeprazole may be added to protect the stomach from the adverse effects of ibuprofen.\n\nIndomethacin is not the optimal choice because it can cause coronary vasoconstriction and worsen the condition. Prednisone is not recommended as a first-line therapy for acute pericarditis, and pericardiocentesis and pericardiectomy are invasive procedures that are not indicated in this patient.",

She recently observed an enlargement of her axillary lymph nodes, which she examines on a weekly basis. She has a remote history of breast cancer in her 60s that was treated with radiation and chemotherapy. She also reports a history of extensive travel to Africa and a 30-pack-year history of smoking. On physical exam, several axillary lymph nodes are palpable with a large non-tender palpable mass in her right axilla measuring 10 x 8 cm. Fine-needle aspiration demonstrates what the pathologist describes as \"a centroblastic and immunoblastic cell presence, suspicious for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL)\u2013diffuse large B cell variant\". Which of the following risk factors is responsible for this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. Travel to Africa\nB. Axillary lymph node involvement\nC. Previous radiation therapy\nD. Female gender\nE. Previous breast cancer\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Previous radiation therapy.\n\nThe patient's history of radiation therapy for breast cancer is a risk factor for developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), specifically diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Radiation therapy is a known risk factor for the development of NHL, particularly in older adults.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:\n\nA. Travel to Africa is not a risk factor for NHL.\n\nB. Axillary lymph node involvement is a symptom of the patient's condition, not a risk factor.\n\nD.

He has not had a fever, cough, vomiting, or diarrhea. He has asthma and eczema. He uses a glucocorticoid inhaler and an albuterol inhaler but has missed his medications for the past week while on vacation. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 100/80. Expiratory and inspiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. There are moderate intercostal and subcostal retractions and a decreased inspiratory to expiratory ratio. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium treatments and intravenous methylprednisolone are given in the emergency department for a presumed asthma exacerbation. One hour later, the child is limp and lethargic. Magnesium sulfate is administered.

After performing a complete physical examination and a screening test for pregnancy, her gynecologist informs her that she is pregnant. She is very surprised as she has been taking oral contraceptives regularly. When the gynecologist asks her about the consumption of any other medications, she mentions that she was placed on treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) 2 months ago. Her current anti-TB regimen includes rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin leading to decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone\nB. Induction of CYP2A6 by rifampin leading to increased inactivation of ethinylestradiol\nC. Induction of CYP2E1 by isoniazid leading to decreased serum levels of progesterone\nD. Interference with the intestinal absorption of the oral contraceptive by pyrazinamide\nE.

Induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin leading to decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone.\n\nRifampin, an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis, is a potent inducer of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. This enzyme is responsible for metabolizing many drugs, including oral contraceptives. When rifampin induces CYP3A4, it increases the metabolism of ethinylestradiol and progesterone, leading to decreased serum levels of these hormones. As a result, the effectiveness of the oral contraceptive is reduced, increasing the risk of pregnancy.",

Foot abduction brace\nB. Osteotomy of the metatarsals\nC. Arthrodesis of the forefoot\nD. Reassurance\nE. Tarsometatarsal capsulotomy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Reassurance.\n\nThe patient has a diagnosis of metatarsus adductus, a common congenital deformity of the foot. The deformity is characterized by an inward turning of the forefoot, with the medial border of the foot concave and the lateral border convex. The fact that the deformity corrects with tickling the lateral border of the foot suggests that it is a flexible deformity, which is likely to resolve on its own with time.\n\nIn this case, the most appropriate next step is reassurance, as the deformity is likely to self-correct without any intervention. The other options are not necessary at this stage, as they are typically reserved for more severe or rigid deformities that do not respond to conservative management.",

Physical examination shows a distended abdomen and right upper quadrant tenderness with normal bowel sounds. Laboratory studies show:\nLeukocyte count 14,000/mm3\nSerum\nTotal bilirubin 1.1 mg/dL\nAST 32 U/L\nALT 40 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase 68 U/L\nAbdominal ultrasonography is performed, but the results are inconclusive.

Hypomotility of the gallbladder.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including right upper abdominal pain and nausea, are consistent with a gallbladder-related issue. The laboratory studies show a mild elevation in alkaline phosphatase, which suggests a possible biliary issue. The cholescintigraphy results, which show the intrahepatic bile ducts, hepatic ducts, common bile duct, and proximal small bowel, indicate that the bile is flowing freely into the small intestine, which makes obstruction of the cystic duct (option E) unlikely.\n\nThe patient's obesity (BMI 34 kg/m2) and lack of evidence of pancreatitis (normal AST and ALT levels) make hypomotility of the gallbladder (option B) a more likely cause of her symptoms. Hypomotility can lead to stasis of bile in the gallbladder, which can cause inflammation and infection, resulting in the patient's symptoms.\n\nAutodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma (option A) is not supported by the laboratory results, which show normal AST and ALT levels. A fistula between the gallbladder and small intestine (option C) would likely cause more severe symptoms and would be visible on imaging studies. Infection with a hepatotropic virus (option D) is not supported by the laboratory results, which do not show any evidence of hepatitis.",

A cardiac catheterization is performed and measurements of the left ventricular volume and pressure at different points in the cardiac cycle are obtained. The patient's pressure-volume loop (gray) is shown with a normal pressure-volume loop (black) for comparison.

Increased ventricular wall stiffness\nD. Impaired left ventricular contractility\nE. Aortic stenosis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Increased ventricular wall stiffness.\n\nThe pressure-volume loop shown in the question indicates that the patient's left ventricle is operating at a higher pressure for any given volume compared to a normal heart. This is consistent with increased ventricular wall stiffness, which can lead to diastolic dysfunction and symptoms such as shortness of breath and palpitations.\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Mitral valve regurgitation would lead to an increase in left ventricular volume, but the pressure-volume loop would not be shifted upwards.\n\nB. Increased systemic vascular resistance would lead to an increase in left ventricular pressure, but the pressure-volume loop would be shifted to the right, not upwards.\n\nD. Impaired left ventricular contractility would lead to a decrease in left ventricular pressure and a shift of the pressure-volume loop to the right.\n\nE. Aortic stenosis would lead to an increase in left ventricular pressure, but the pressure-volume loop would be shifted to the right, not upwards.\n\nTherefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is increased ventricular wall stiffness.",

After acute treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the patient is able to recover most of his speech. Subsequent neurologic exam finds that the patient is fluent while speaking and is able to comprehend both one and two step instructions. Noticeably the patient remains unable to complete tasks involving verbal repetition. Residual damage to which of the following structures is most likely responsible for this patient's syndrome?\nOptions:\nA. Arcuate fasciculus\nB. Inferior frontal gyrus\nC. Superior temporal gyrus\nD. Inferior frontal gyrus + superior temporal gyrus\nE. Arcuate fasciculus + inferior frontal gyrus + superior temporal gyrus\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Arcuate fasciculus.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, specifically the inability to repeat verbal phrases despite being fluent and able to comprehend instructions, are consistent with conduction aphasia. Conduction aphasia is typically associated with damage to the arcuate fasciculus, a bundle of fibers that connects the Wernicke's area (responsible for language comprehension) and Broca's area (responsible for language production).\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* B. Inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area) is involved in language production, and damage to this area would result in expressive aphasia, characterized by difficulty speaking in grammatically correct sentences.\n* C. Superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) is involved in language comprehension, and damage to this area would result in receptive aphasia, characterized by difficulty understanding spoken language.\n* D. Inferior frontal gyrus + superior temporal gyrus would result in a combination of expressive and receptive aphasia, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.\n* E. Arcuate fasciculus + inferior frontal gyrus + superior temporal gyrus would result in a more global language impairment, which is not consistent with the patient's relatively preserved language abilities except for verbal repetition.",

She says she has always been \"large\" and was constantly targeted by her classmates and coworkers for being so. Her main concern at the moment is her acne and unwanted facial hair on her upper lip, for which she often visits a local spa. She has tried numerous diet plans, exercise regimens, and cosmetic products with little to no effect. Recently, she underwent a glucose tolerance test that showed a plasma glucose level of 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L) after 2 hours of a 75 g dose of oral glucose. She has a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a menstrual cycle that occurs every 45 days. Her pulse is 72/min and the blood pressure is 138/80 mm Hg. On physical examination, her height is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) and her weight is 85 kg (187 lb), and she has severe inflammatory acne over the cheeks and forehead and dark coarse hairs on the back.

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient\u2019s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient\u2019s two older siblings are both healthy. The patient\u2019s temperature is 97.8\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 58/37 mmHg, pulse is 166/min, and respirations are 38/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress. His abdomen is firm and distended with hypoactive bowel sounds.\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely etiology of this fetus\u2019s presentation?\nOptions:\nA. Duodenal atresia\nB. Intestinal malrotation\nC. Meconium ileus\nD. Necrotizing enterocolitis\nE. Pyloric stenosis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Duodenal atresia.\n\nThe patient's presentation with bilious vomiting, failure to pass meconium, and a firm and distended abdomen with hypoactive bowel sounds suggests a high intestinal obstruction. The prenatal ultrasound finding of an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm, which is elevated, also supports this diagnosis. The quadruple screen results, which showed decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A, are consistent with a diagnosis of trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), which is often associated with duodenal atresia.\n\nDuodenal atresia is a congenital anomaly that occurs when the duodenum fails to develop properly, resulting in a blockage of the small intestine. It is a common cause of intestinal obstruction in newborns and is often associated with other congenital anomalies, such as trisomy 21.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\nB. Intestinal malrotation is a possible cause of intestinal obstruction, but it is less likely to present with bilious vomiting and a firm and distended abdomen.\n\nC. Meconium ileus is a condition that occurs when the meconium in the intestine becomes thick and sticky, causing a blockage. It is often associated with cystic fibrosis, but it is less likely to present with bilious vomiting.\n\nD. Necrotizing enterocolitis is a condition that occurs when the intestine becomes inflamed and damaged, often in premature infants. It is less likely to present with bilious vomiting and a firm and distended abdomen.\n\nE. Pyloric stenosis is a condition that occurs when the pylorus muscle becomes thickened, causing a blockage of the stomach. It typically presents with non-bilious vomiting and is less likely to present with a firm and distended abdomen.",

Superior vena cava\nB. Inferior vena cava\nC. Coronary sinus\nD. Pulmonary artery\nE. Pulmonary vein\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Coronary sinus.\n\nThe coronary sinus is a vein that drains deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle itself. It has the lowest oxygen content because it carries blood that has already passed through the heart's capillaries and has released its oxygen to the heart muscle.\n\nThe superior and inferior vena cavae (options A and B) also carry deoxygenated blood, but they drain blood from the upper and lower body, respectively, and have slightly higher oxygen content than the coronary sinus.\n\nThe pulmonary artery (option D) carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs, where it will pick up oxygen and release carbon dioxide. While it has low oxygen content, it is not the lowest.\n\nThe pulmonary vein (option E) carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart, so it has a high oxygen content.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C, the coronary sinus.",

His only medication is metformin. His pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 170/92 mm Hg. Straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot. There is no pain in the back. His muscle strength is normal. Femoral pulses are palpable; right pedal pulses are absent. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Femoropopliteal artery stenosis\nB. Vasculitis of the right popliteal artery\nC. Acute thrombosis of right popliteal vein\nD. Lumbar spinal stenosis\nE. Aortoiliac artery stenosis\n\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Femoropopliteal artery stenosis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level, calf cramps, and pain relief after resting, are consistent with intermittent claudication, which is a classic symptom of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The absence of right pedal pulses and the presence of femoral pulses suggest that the blockage is in the femoropopliteal segment, which is the artery that runs from the femoral artery to the popliteal artery. This is consistent with femoropopliteal artery stenosis.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:\n\n* B. Vasculitis of the right popliteal artery is unlikely, as there is no mention of systemic symptoms or signs of inflammation.\n* C. Acute thrombosis of right popliteal vein would present with sudden onset of pain, swelling, and warmth in the affected leg, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.\n* D. Lumbar spinal stenosis would typically cause back pain, which is not present in this patient.\n* E. Aortoiliac artery stenosis would likely cause symptoms in both legs, rather than just one leg.",

Induces deamination of cytosine\nE. Induces breaks in double-stranded DNA\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Induces breaks in double-stranded DNA.\n\nRadiation therapy, including external beam radiation, works by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, ultimately leading to their death. One of the primary mechanisms by which radiation damages DNA is by inducing breaks in double-stranded DNA. This can occur through the formation of free radicals, which can interact with DNA and cause strand breaks. As a result, the cancer cell's ability to replicate and divide is disrupted, leading to cell death.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the effects of radiation on cancer cells:\n\nA. Thymidine dimers are a type of DNA lesion that can occur as a result of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, not external beam radiation.\n\nB.

TSS is a life-threatening medical condition caused by bacterial toxins, often produced by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. In this case, the presence of a tampon in the vagina suggests that the patient has menstrual TSS, which is often associated with Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nThe variable \u03b2-sequence of the T cell receptor is involved in the binding and activation of T cells in response to superantigens, such as the toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) produced by Staphylococcus aureus. Superantigens are able to bind directly to the variable \u03b2-sequence of the T cell receptor, bypassing the normal antigen presentation process and leading to a massive activation of T cells and the release of cytokines, which contributes to the development of TSS.",

She has been visiting the same dentist since childhood and for the past 2 years has had at least 2 visits for dental caries. She eventually admitted to him that she regularly induces vomiting by putting her fingers down her throat. She says she has been doing this for the last few years and purging at least once a week. More recently, she has been inducing emesis more often and even looked into diuretics as she feels that she is gaining more and more weight compared to her \u2018skinny friends\u2019. Her BMI is at the 50th percentile for her age and sex. Which of the following features is most consistent with this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. Patients with this disorder are not further sub-typed\nB. Patients do not usually initiate treatment\nC. Patients can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia\nD. Patients will typically have a BMI between 17\u201318.5 kg/m2\nE. Patients usually have significant medical complications\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Patients can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including inducing vomiting and using diuretics, are consistent with bulimia nervosa. The fact that she has a normal BMI (50th percentile) and is concerned about gaining weight compared to her friends suggests that she may not have a history of anorexia nervosa, which is characterized by a significantly low body mass index (BMI). However, it is possible that she may have had anorexia nervosa in the past or may develop it in the future, which is why option C is the most consistent with her condition.",

He had undergone a successful hernia surgery 14 hours ago. Before the surgery, he was pre-treated with atropine, scopolamine, and morphine and recovered well in the PACU after the surgery. There were no complications in the step-down unit and the patient continued to recover. On the med-surg floor, his temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), the heart rate is 98/min, the respiratory rate is 15/min, the blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg, the oxygen saturation is 90%. On physical exam, he is a well-developed, obese man. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His incision site is clean, dry, and intact with an appropriate level of swelling and erythema. During the physical, the patient mentions some discomfort in his abdomen and pelvis and during a records review it is noted that he has not passed urine in the PACU, step-down unit, or since arriving on the med-surg floor.

He was born at 38 weeks' gestation via normal vaginal delivery. He weighed 3005 g (6 lb, 10 oz) at birth and currently weighs 2835 g (6 lb, 4 oz). He has been latching on and breastfeeding well since birth. His mother has a history of Graves' disease and underwent near-total thyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy after her symptoms could not be controlled with antithyroid drugs.

On physical examination, the patient is altered and not responsive to commands. Oriented x 0. The abdomen is significantly distended. Shifting dullness is present and a positive fluid wave can be elicited. Hyperreflexia and asterixis are noted.

Variceal gastrointestinal bleeding\nD. Portal vein thrombosis\nE. Hypoglycemia\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.\n\nThe patient's presentation with altered mental status, asterixis, and hyperreflexia suggests hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver cirrhosis. The elevated ammonia level (100 \u00b5g/dL) also supports this diagnosis. The presence of ascites and gastric varices on ultrasound and endoscopy, respectively, are consistent with portal hypertension and cirrhosis.\n\nThe patient's fever (38.0\u00b0C) and abdominal distension suggest an underlying infection, which is likely spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Cardiac contusion\nB. Hemorrhage\nC. Myocardial infarction\nD. Pulmonary contusion\nE. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Cardiac contusion.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and test results are consistent with a cardiac contusion, which is a bruise of the heart muscle. The elevated troponins indicate cardiac damage, and the elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure suggests increased pressure in the heart. The patient's chest pain and bruising over the chest wall also support this diagnosis.\n\nCardiac contusion is a common injury in motor vehicle collisions, especially when the driver is unrestrained. It can cause damage to the heart muscle, leading to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and arrhythmias.\n\nThe other options are not as likely based on the information provided:\n\nB. Hemorrhage is possible, but the patient's blood pressure is not significantly low, and there is no mention of significant bleeding.\n\nC. Myocardial infarction (heart attack) is possible, but the patient's ECG only shows sinus tachycardia, and there is no mention of ST-segment elevation or other signs of a heart attack.\n\nD. Pulmonary contusion is possible, but the patient's oxygen saturation is normal, and there is no mention of respiratory distress or other signs of a pulmonary contusion.\n\nE.

He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications. Which of the following will be the best treatment option for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Adding dopamine to his treatment regimen\nB. Adding lisinopril to his treatment regimen\nC. Liver transplantation\nD. Switching cefotaxime to ceftriaxone\nE. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Adding dopamine to his treatment regimen.\n\nThe patient is experiencing oliguria (decreased urine output) in the setting of constant fluid intake, which suggests that he may be developing hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). HRS is a complication of cirrhosis characterized by renal failure and oliguria. The patient's laboratory results, including a low urine sodium level and lack of protein or blood in the urine, are consistent with HRS.\n\nDopamine is a medication that can help improve renal perfusion and increase urine output in patients with HRS. It is often used in combination with albumin to help manage HRS.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* B. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor that is contraindicated in patients with cirrhosis and HRS, as it can worsen renal function.\n* C. Liver transplantation is not a treatment for HRS, and the patient's condition is not yet severe enough to warrant transplantation.\n* D. Switching cefotaxime to ceftriaxone is not relevant to the patient's oliguria and HRS.\n* E. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) is a procedure used to manage portal hypertension, but it is not a treatment for HRS.",

Potassium hydroxide preparation\nD. Skin biopsy\nE. Antinuclear antibody testing\n\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Potassium hydroxide preparation.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and rash are consistent with tinea versicolor, a fungal infection of the skin. The potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation is a diagnostic test that can confirm the presence of fungal elements in the skin. It involves scraping the skin lesion and mixing the scrapings with potassium hydroxide, which helps to dissolve the keratin protein and allows the fungal elements to be visualized under a microscope.\n\nA Wood lamp examination (Option A) is used to diagnose certain skin conditions, such as vitiligo or erythrasma, but it is not typically used to diagnose tinea versicolor.\n\nSkin culture (Option B) may be used to diagnose bacterial or fungal infections, but it is not the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis of tinea versicolor.\n\nSkin biopsy (Option D) is an invasive procedure that may be used to diagnose skin conditions, but it is not necessary to diagnose tinea versicolor.\n\nAntinuclear antibody testing (Option E) is used to diagnose autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, and is not relevant to the diagnosis of tinea versicolor.",

He then develops progressive respiratory failure and is admitted to the neonatal ICU. A single loud S2 heart sound is appreciated as well as a machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border. Radiography shows an enlarged \"egg-shaped\" heart. The newborn is then taken for a atrial septostomy to alleviate the condition pending definitive surgical correction. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this newborn's condition?\nOptions:\nA. Coarctation of the aorta\nB. Persistent truncus arteriosus\nC. Tetralogy of Fallot\nD. Transposition of great vessels\nE. Tricuspid atresia\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Transposition of great vessels.\n\nThe symptoms described, such as extreme cyanosis, progressive respiratory failure, and a single loud S2 heart sound, are consistent with transposition of the great vessels. The machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border is also a characteristic finding in this condition. The \"egg-shaped\" heart on radiography is also a classic feature of transposition of the great vessels.\n\nThe fact that the newborn underwent an atrial septostomy to alleviate the condition pending definitive surgical correction further supports this diagnosis. Atrial septostomy is a procedure that creates a hole in the atrial septum to allow oxygenated blood to mix with deoxygenated blood, which is often necessary in transposition of the great vessels to improve oxygenation.\n\nThe other options do not fit the symptoms and findings described:\n\nA. Coarctation of the aorta would not typically cause cyanosis or a machine-like murmur.\n\nB. Persistent truncus arteriosus would not typically cause a single loud S2 heart sound or an \"egg-shaped\" heart on radiography.\n\nC. Tetralogy of Fallot would typically cause a loud systolic murmur, not a machine-like murmur, and would not typically require an atrial septostomy.\n\nE. Tricuspid atresia would typically cause a loud systolic murmur and would not typically cause a machine-like murmur or an \"egg-shaped\" heart on radiography.",

An ECG shows no abnormalities, and laboratory testing shows the following:\nLaboratory test\nSerum glucose (fasting)  105 mg/dL\nSerum electrolytes \nSodium  142 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.9 mEq/L\nChloride 101 mEq/L\nSerum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl\nBlood urea nitrogen 10 mg/dl\nCholesterol, total 250 mg/dL\nHDL-cholesterol 35 mg/dL\nLDL-cholesterol 186 mg/dL\nTriglycerides 170 mg/dL\nUrinalysis \nGlucose  negative\nKetones negative\nLeucocytes negative\nNitrites negative \nRed blood cells (RBC) negative \nCasts negative \nWhich of the following lab abnormalities in this patient is an indication for treatment?\nOptions:\nA. Blood pressure reading\nB. Patient\u2019s weight\nC. High triglyceride levels\nD. High LDL-cholesterol\nE. Serum glucose level\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. High LDL-cholesterol.\n\nThe patient's LDL-cholesterol level of 186 mg/dL is above the recommended level of 130 mg/dL for individuals with a moderate risk of heart disease. This is an indication for treatment, as high LDL-cholesterol is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe other options are not necessarily indications for treatment:\n\nA. Blood pressure reading: While the patient's blood pressure is slightly elevated, it is not yet in the hypertensive range (140/90 mmHg or higher).\n\nB. Patient's weight: Obesity is a risk factor for various health problems, but it is not a lab abnormality that requires treatment in and of itself.\n\nC. High triglyceride levels: While the patient's triglyceride level is elevated, it is not severely so (severe hypertriglyceridemia is typically defined as a level above 500 mg/dL).\n\nE. Serum glucose level: The patient's fasting glucose level of 105 mg/dL is considered impaired fasting glucose, but it is not yet in the diabetic range (126 mg/dL or higher).",

On arrival, she is lethargic and incoherent. She has severe facial lacerations and is in respiratory distress. Her pulse is 130/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 90/58 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. Examination shows multiple facial lacerations. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 12.1 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Diaphragmatic rupture\nB. Traumatic bronchial rupture\nC. Thoracic aortic rupture\nD. Cardiac tamponade\nE. Tension pneumothorax\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Traumatic bronchial rupture.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with a traumatic bronchial rupture. The deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right suggests a rupture of the left mainstem bronchus, which is confirmed by the depression of the left mainstem bronchus on the chest x-ray. The patient's respiratory distress, decreased breath sounds over the left lung base, and low oxygen saturation also support this diagnosis.\n\nWhile diaphragmatic rupture (option A) is a possible diagnosis, the lack of abdominal contents in the chest cavity and the presence of bowel sounds make it less likely. Thoracic aortic rupture (option C) is also possible, but the widened mediastinum is not specific to this diagnosis, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a bronchial rupture. Cardiac tamponade (option D) is unlikely given the patient's normal hemoglobin concentration and lack of cardiac symptoms. Tension pneumothorax (option E) is also unlikely given the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 26-year-old G1P0 woman presents to her primary care physician\u2019s office with feelings of anxiety and trouble with sleep. She finds it difficult initiating sleep, occasionally has palpitations, and feels fatigued. She denies having similar symptoms in the past or starting any new medications or illicit drugs. She is currently 10 weeks pregnant and is closely followed by her obstetrician. Her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 125/70 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical exam, the patient is mildly diaphoretic. The skin is warm and the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged with thyroid bruits. Laboratory studies are significant for a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.01 \u00b5U/mL (normal is 0.5-5.0 \u00b5U/mL) and an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) that is inappropriate for her pregnancy. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Methimazole\nB. Observation\nC. Propylthiouracil\nD. Radioiodine therapy\nE. Thyroidectomy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Propylthiouracil.\n\nThe patient is presenting with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including anxiety, trouble sleeping, palpitations, and fatigue, which are consistent with an overactive thyroid gland. The physical exam findings of a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with thyroid bruits and laboratory results showing a suppressed TSH level and elevated FT4 level confirm the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism.\n\nIn pregnancy, the treatment of hyperthyroidism is critical to prevent complications for both the mother and the fetus. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the preferred medication for hyperthyroidism during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, because it is less likely to cross the placenta and affect the fetal thyroid gland compared to methimazole. Radioiodine therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy, and thyroidectomy may be considered in some cases, but it is not the first-line treatment. Observation is not a suitable option, as untreated hyperthyroidism can lead to serious complications.",

He is asymptomatic at his office visit and denies any new complaints. He has a 10-year history of hypertension that remains poorly controlled on maximum doses of lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and amlodipine. His past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. He has no smoking history, drinks alcohol occasionally, and denies any illicit drug use. His father required a kidney transplant in his forties. The physical exam is notable for palpable flank masses bilaterally. Laboratory studies show a creatinine of 2.5. The physician orders a renal ultrasound, and the results are shown.

She says that the chest pain is worse when she breathes or coughs. Furthermore, on the way to the hospital she noticed that there were specks of blood on a tissue that she coughed into. She has no previous medical history and does not recall anything that could have provoked these symptoms. On presentation her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/65 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, respirations are 21/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air.

Autosomal partial dominance\nD. X-linked dominant\nE. X-linked recessive\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Autosomal dominant.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and test results suggest a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, which is being treated with an anticoagulant medication. The fact that the patient is being monitored with a standard blood test, likely aPTT or INR, suggests that the medication is a heparin or warfarin, which are commonly used to treat pulmonary embolism.\n\nThe underlying cause of the patient's symptoms is likely a genetic deficiency of antithrombin III, protein C, or protein S, which are all inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

A urethral smear shows gram negative diplococci within white blood cells. The organism grows well when cultured on Thayer-Martin agar. The patient is prescribed a course of ceftriaxone and the infection resolves without further complication. One year later, the patient returns with the same infection. Which of the following best explains this lack of lasting immunity?\nOptions:\nA. Exotoxin release\nB. Antigenic variation\nC. Polysaccharide capsule\nD. Bruton's agammaglobulinemia\nE. Lack of necessary vaccination\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Antigenic variation.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and the presence of gram-negative diplococci within white blood cells in the urethral smear suggest a diagnosis of gonorrhea, caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The fact that the patient returns with the same infection a year later suggests that there is no lasting immunity to the infection.\n\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae is able to evade the host's immune system through antigenic variation, which is the ability of the bacterium to change its surface antigens, making it difficult for the host to mount an effective immune response. This means that even if the patient has been infected and cleared the infection previously, they can still be re-infected with a different strain of the bacterium.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the lack of lasting immunity to gonorrhea:\n\nA. Exotoxin release is a mechanism used by some bacteria to cause disease, but it is not related to the lack of immunity to gonorrhea.\n\nC. Polysaccharide capsule is a feature of some bacteria, including Neisseria meningitidis, but it is not the primary mechanism of immune evasion in gonorrhea.\n\nD. Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is a genetic disorder that affects the immune system, but it is not directly related to the lack of immunity to gonorrhea.\n\nE. Lack of necessary vaccination is not relevant, as there is no vaccine available against gonorrhea.",

Anti-D antibodies.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including jaundice, mildly distended abdomen, and palpable liver and spleen, are consistent with hemolytic disease of the newborn. The laboratory results show a low hemoglobin, elevated reticulocyte count, and a positive anti-Rh antibody titer in the mother, which suggests that the mother has developed antibodies against the Rh antigen on the fetal red blood cells. This is likely due to fetomaternal hemorrhage during pregnancy, which was not detected due to lack of prenatal care. The fact that the mother is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-negative makes it unlikely that the antibodies are directed against the Rh antigen. Instead, the antibodies are likely directed against another antigen, such as the B antigen, which is present on the fetal red blood cells. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is anti-D antibodies.",

He has been trying to conceive for over 2 years with his wife and previous evaluation of his wife's fertility revealed no abnormalities. Physical exam reveals a tall man with long extremities, sparse body hair, gynecomastia, and small testes. Laboratory studies reveal increased serum follicle-stimulating hormone concentration and an increased estradiol:testosterone ratio. Genetic studies reveal a cytogenetic abnormality. If this abnormality was inherited from the patient's father, at which stage of spermatogenesis did this error most likely occur?\nOptions:\nA. Primary spermatocyte\nB. Secondary spermatocyte\nC. Spermatid\nD. Spermatogonium\nE. Spermatozoon\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Spermatogonium.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Klinefelter syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome (47, XXY). This occurs when there is a nondisjunction event during meiosis, resulting in an abnormal number of chromosomes.\n\nSince the patient inherited the abnormality from his father, the error most likely occurred during spermatogenesis in the father, specifically during the stage of spermatogonium. Spermatogonia are the diploid stem cells that give rise to spermatozoa. If a nondisjunction event occurs during this stage, it can result in spermatozoa with an abnormal number of chromosomes, which can then fertilize an egg and lead to a child with Klinefelter syndrome.",

She has had a runny nose and a low-grade fever for the past 2 days, with some hoarseness and a rough-sounding cough that started this afternoon. This evening she began making some high-pitched sounds when taking breaths, and she seemed to be having some trouble breathing. She is alert and does not appear to be in acute distress. She has a temperature of 38.0\u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F), with a respiratory rate of 50/min and O2 saturation of 97%. There is audible inspiratory stridor that worsens when she starts to cry during the examination. She has an occasional barking cough. Her pharynx is mildly erythematous with normal tonsils and no exudate. A frontal X-ray of the upper chest airways is obtained (shown in the image). Which of the following is the best step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs of the neck\nB. Intubation\nC. Racemic epinephrine and intramuscular corticosteroid therapy\nD. Intravenous antibiotics\nE. Trial of bronchodilator therapy and oral steroids\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Racemic epinephrine and intramuscular corticosteroid therapy.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with croup, a viral infection that causes inflammation of the upper airway. The presence of inspiratory stridor, barking cough, and the X-ray finding of a \"steeple sign\" (narrowing of the trachea) support this diagnosis.\n\nRacemic epinephrine is a medication that can help reduce airway swelling and relieve symptoms. Intramuscular corticosteroid therapy is also effective in reducing inflammation and improving symptoms. This combination is the best step in management for this patient.\n\nIntubation (B) may be necessary in severe cases of croup, but it is not the first step in management. Anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs of the neck (A) may be helpful in ruling out other diagnoses, but they are not necessary in this case. Intravenous antibiotics (D) are not indicated for viral croup. A trial of bronchodilator therapy and oral steroids (E) may be helpful in other respiratory conditions, but they are not the best choice for croup.",

Decreased lower esophageal tone.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of retrosternal burning associated with eating are consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) does not function properly, allowing stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus and cause symptoms. The LES is a ring-like muscle that normally relaxes to allow food to pass into the stomach and then tightens to prevent stomach acid from flowing back up into the esophagus. In GERD, the LES tone is decreased, allowing stomach acid to flow back up into the esophagus and cause symptoms.",

He endorses diffuse abdominal tenderness. His past medical history is notable for diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, dyslipidemia, depression, and morbid obesity. He also is currently being treated for an outbreak of genital herpes. His temperature is 99.0\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 184/102 mmHg, pulse is 89/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an obese man in no acute distress. A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is performed and is unremarkable. The patient is admitted to the observation unit for monitoring of his pain. Notably, the patient's abdominal pain improves after an enema and multiple bowel movements. The patient's evening laboratory values are ordered and return as seen below.\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 141 mEq/L\nCl-: 99 mEq/L\nK+: 4.8 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 11 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 177 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 3.1 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's laboratory derangements?\nOptions:\nA.

Metformin.\n\nThe patient's laboratory results show a metabolic acidosis with a low bicarbonate level (11 mEq/L) and an elevated anion gap (calculated anion gap = 141 - 99 - 11 = 31, which is elevated). The patient's creatinine level is also elevated at 3.1 mg/dL, indicating renal impairment.\n\nMetformin, an oral hypoglycemic agent, is known to cause lactic acidosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment. The patient's history of diabetic nephropathy and current creatinine level suggest that he may be at risk for metformin-associated lactic acidosis.\n\nThe other options are less likely to be the cause of the patient's laboratory derangements:\n\nA. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication that can cause renal impairment, but it is not typically associated with lactic acidosis.\n\nB. Atorvastatin is a statin medication that can cause mild elevations in creatinine, but it is not typically associated with lactic acidosis.\n\nC. Insulin is not likely to cause lactic acidosis, and the patient's glucose level is not severely elevated.\n\nE. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker medication that can cause bradycardia and hypotension, but it is not typically associated with lactic acidosis or renal impairment.",

He presents with a 1-year history of worsening shortness of breath and weight loss. He is a former construction worker, and worked in a steel mill when he was in high school. He is an active smoker with a 36-pack-year smoking history. The blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg, pulse rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, and the BMI is 31 kg/m2. The patient is afebrile and the oxygen saturation at rest is 95% on room air. The pulmonary examination reveals a mildly prolonged expiratory phase, and no wheezing or crackles are auscultated. A pulmonary function test is recommended for the patient, and 2 weeks later he returns with a report that shows an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% and FEV1 of 50% of the predicted value. The lung volumes show a total lung capacity of 110% of predicted value, a residual volume of 115% of predicted value, and a DLCO of 60% of predicted value. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Asbestosis\nB. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome\nC. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\nD. Bronchiectasis\nE. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, medical history, and pulmonary function test results are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient is a former smoker with a significant smoking history, which is a major risk factor for COPD. The pulmonary function test results show an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%, which is below the normal range, indicating airflow obstruction. The FEV1 of 50% of predicted value also suggests significant airflow limitation. The lung volumes show a total lung capacity of 110% of predicted value and a residual volume of 115% of predicted value, which is consistent with hyperinflation, a characteristic feature of COPD. The DLCO of 60% of predicted value suggests some degree of emphysema.\n\nAsbestosis (A) is unlikely given the patient's history of working in a steel mill, but the pulmonary function test results do not show the characteristic restrictive pattern and decreased DLCO seen in asbestosis.\n\nObesity hypoventilation syndrome (B) is unlikely given the patient's normal oxygen saturation at rest and the absence of other symptoms suggestive of sleep-disordered breathing.\n\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (C) is unlikely given the patient's history of smoking and the pulmonary function test results, which do not show the characteristic restrictive pattern and decreased DLCO seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nBronchiectasis (D) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and pulmonary function test results, which do not show the characteristic airflow obstruction and hyperinflation seen in bronchiectasis.",

What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Thoracocentesis\nB. Inhaled beclomethasone\nC. Avoid exposure to birds\nD. Isoniazid for 6 months\nE. Reassurance\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Avoid exposure to birds.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including a dry cough, fever, and chills, are consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a type of lung disease caused by an allergic reaction to inhaled substances. The fact that the symptoms occur at the end of the workday and last a few hours suggests that the patient is being exposed to the allergen at work. The patient's job as a zookeeper, particularly his exposure to birds, is the likely source of the allergen.\n\nAvoiding exposure to birds is the most appropriate treatment for this patient. This may involve removing the patient from his job or taking steps to minimize his exposure to bird dust and feathers. Other treatments, such as corticosteroids, may also be necessary to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms.\n\nThoracocentesis (A) is a procedure to drain fluid from the chest cavity and is not indicated in this case. Inhaled beclomethasone (B) may be used to treat asthma, but it is not the primary treatment for hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Isoniazid (D) is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis, which is not suspected in this case based on the negative PPD skin test. Reassurance (E) is not an appropriate treatment, as the patient's symptoms require medical attention and intervention.",

She has a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. On physical examination, her uterus is uniformly enlarged. Ultrasound reveals a thickened endometrial stripe and tissue biopsy reveals neoplastic endometrial cells. A workup for metastatic disease is negative and the gynecologist recommends a laparoscopic hysterectomy. During the procedure, the surgeon ligates multiple vessels in order to remove the entire uterus. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient develops left-sided flank pain and oliguria. Serum creatinine is found to be 1.4 mg/dl whereas it was 1.0 mg/dl prior to the operation. Renal ultrasound is normal. Urinalysis is notable for hematuria. Ligation of which of the following vessels most likely contributed to this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. Artery of Sampson\nB. Ovarian artery\nC. Superior vesical artery\nD. Uterine artery\nE. Inferior vesical artery\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Ovarian artery.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of left-sided flank pain, oliguria, and hematuria suggest a diagnosis of ureteral injury or obstruction. The fact that the renal ultrasound is normal suggests that the problem is not related to the kidney itself, but rather to the ureter.\n\nDuring a laparoscopic hysterectomy, the ovarian arteries are ligated to control bleeding from the uterus. However, the ovarian arteries are in close proximity to the ureters, and ligation of the ovarian artery can sometimes inadvertently damage or ligate the ureter, leading to obstruction or injury.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the ureter and are less likely to cause the patient's symptoms:\n\nA. The artery of Sampson is a small artery that supplies the round ligament of the uterus and is not related to the ureter.\n\nC. The superior vesical artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery that supplies the bladder, but it is not typically ligated during a hysterectomy.\n\nD.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1\nD. Human herpesvirus-8\nE. Human papillomavirus type 16\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Epstein-Barr virus.\n\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's lymphoma, particularly in the mixed cellularity subtype. EBV infection can lead to the transformation of B cells, which can then give rise to Hodgkin's lymphoma.

A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head is shown. Which of the following most likely explains this patient\u2019s symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Herniation of the uncus\nB. Herniation of the cingulate gyrus\nC. Occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery\nD. Occlusion of the basilar artery\nE. Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Herniation of the uncus.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including disorientation, unequal pupils, and a right-sided visual field defect, suggest a compressive lesion affecting the left side of the brain. The CT scan shows a left-sided subdural hematoma, which is likely causing the symptoms.\n\nThe unequal pupils, with the left pupil being 6 mm and non-reactive to light, suggest compression of the left oculomotor nerve, which is consistent with uncal herniation. Uncal herniation occurs when the medial part of the temporal lobe (the uncus) herniates through the tentorial notch, compressing the brainstem and cranial nerves.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings:\n\nB. Herniation of the cingulate gyrus would not cause the described symptoms.\n\nC. Occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery would cause symptoms related to the medial aspect of the frontal and parietal lobes, not the temporal lobe.\n\nD. Occlusion of the basilar artery would cause brainstem symptoms, not unilateral symptoms like the patient is experiencing.\n\nE. Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery would cause spinal cord symptoms, not brain symptoms like the patient is experiencing.",

A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Which of the following best describes this class of immune cells?\nOptions:\nA. CD8+ T lymphocytes\nB. Bone marrow-derived macrophages\nC. CD4+ T lymphocytes\nD. Natural killer cells\nE. Band neutrophils\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Natural killer cells.\n\nNatural killer (NK) cells are a type of immune cell that can recognize and lyse abnormal cells, such as tumor cells or virally infected cells, without the need for prior activation or antigen presentation. They are able to do this through the recognition of certain surface molecules, such as MHC class I, which are often downregulated on abnormal cells.\n\nIn this scenario, the monoclonal plasma cells have downregulated MHC class I molecules, making them susceptible to recognition and lysis by NK cells. NK cells play an important role in immune surveillance and can help to prevent the proliferation of abnormal cells, including cancer cells.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. CD8+ T lymphocytes require antigen presentation and activation before they can lyse target cells.\n\nB. Bone marrow-derived macrophages are involved in phagocytosis and antigen presentation, but they do not lyse abnormal cells without prior activation.\n\nC. CD4+ T lymphocytes are involved in helper functions and activation of other immune cells, but they do not directly lyse abnormal cells.\n\nE. Band neutrophils are immature neutrophils that are not involved in immune surveillance or lysis of abnormal cells.",

She feels that the muscles in her shoulders and hips have been getting weaker and sometimes feel sore. She now has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. She has also noticed new difficulty with swallowing solid foods, but has no trouble with liquids. She has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia controlled with fluvastatin. Her maternal uncle died at age 26 from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and her mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurologic examination shows moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 13.7 g/dL\nLeukocytes 11,200/mm3\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate 33 mm/h\nSerum\nCreatine kinase 212 U/L\nLactate dehydrogenase 164 U/L\nAST 34 U/L\nALT 35 U/L\nWhich of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\"\nOptions:\nA.

Positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies\nE. Dystrophin gene mutation on genetic analysis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of dermatomyositis, a type of inflammatory myopathy. The presence of muscle weakness, particularly in the shoulder and hip muscles, and difficulty with swallowing solid foods are consistent with this diagnosis. The elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels also support this diagnosis.\n\nPerifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy is a characteristic finding in dermatomyositis, and would confirm the diagnosis.\n\nOption A is incorrect because intrafascicular infiltration is more characteristic of neurogenic disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nOption B is incorrect because inflammation of synovial spaces is more characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis or other joint disorders.\n\nOption D is incorrect because positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies are more characteristic of myasthenia gravis, a disorder of the neuromuscular junction.\n\nOption E is incorrect because dystrophin gene mutation is more characteristic of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, which is a genetic disorder that affects muscle function.",

He states that he was resting at home when he noticed he had difficulty reading. Currently, he is also starting to see double, and is seeing two images on top of each other. Earlier today, he felt ill with nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, which he attributed to food he had eaten at a picnic the day before. When asked which foods he ate, he lists potato salad, a hamburger, deviled eggs, and pickles made by his neighbor. He also heard that his friend who went to the picnic with him has developed similar symptoms and was seen in another hospital earlier. While in the emergency room, the patient\u2019s temperature is 98.4\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), pulse is 75/min, blood pressure is 122/84 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Cranial nerve exam is notable for fixed pupillary dilation, and difficulty depressing both eyes. The remainder of his exam is normal. Which of the following is the pathogenesis of this patient\u2019s presentation?\nOptions:\nA. Decreased acetylcholine release\nB. Overactivation of adenylate cyclase\nC. Release of interferon-gamma\nD. Degradation of phospholipids\nE. Inhibition of GABA release\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Decreased acetylcholine release.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including blurry vision, diplopia (double vision), and fixed pupillary dilation, suggest a cholinergic crisis, which is consistent with botulism poisoning. Botulinum toxin, produced by Clostridium botulinum, inhibits the release of acetylcholine from nerve terminals, leading to a decrease in acetylcholine release. This results in a range of neurological symptoms, including cranial nerve palsies, pupillary dilation, and muscle weakness.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of botulism:\n\nB. Overactivation of adenylate cyclase is associated with cholera toxin, not botulinum toxin.\n\nC. Release of interferon-gamma is an immune response to viral infections, not related to botulism.\n\nD. Degradation of phospholipids is not a known mechanism of botulism.\n\nE. Inhibition of GABA release is associated with certain neurological disorders, but not botulism.\n\nThe patient's history of eating food from a picnic, particularly the homemade pickles, suggests a possible source of botulinum toxin. The fact that his friend who attended the same picnic has similar symptoms further supports this diagnosis.",

Galactosemia\nB. Biliary atresia\nC. Crigler\u2013Najjar syndrome\nD. Breast milk jaundice\nE. Dubin-Johnson syndrome\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Biliary atresia.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as increasing jaundice, pale stools, and elevated direct bilirubin, suggest a diagnosis of biliary atresia. The elevated alkaline phosphatase and \u03b3-glutamyl transferase levels also support this diagnosis. Biliary atresia is a congenital disorder characterized by the absence or closure of the bile ducts, leading to jaundice, pale stools, and liver damage.\n\nGalactosemia (A) is a metabolic disorder that can cause jaundice, but it is less likely given the patient's normal AST and ALT levels. Crigler-Najjar syndrome (C) is a rare genetic disorder that affects bilirubin metabolism, but it typically presents with indirect hyperbilirubinemia, not direct hyperbilirubinemia like in this case. Breast milk jaundice (D) is a common cause of jaundice in newborns, but it typically resolves on its own and is not associated with pale stools or elevated liver enzymes. Dubin-Johnson syndrome (E) is a rare genetic disorder that affects bilirubin excretion, but it typically presents with a more gradual onset of jaundice and is not associated with pale stools or elevated liver enzymes.",

U waves\nD. Peaked T waves\nE. PR prolongation\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. QT prolongation.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and perioral numbness, are consistent with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels). The hand spasm observed by the nurse is also a classic sign of hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia is a common complication of total thyroidectomy, particularly if the parathyroid glands are inadvertently removed or damaged during surgery.\n\nOn an electrocardiogram (ECG), hypocalcemia can cause QT prolongation, which is a lengthening of the QT interval.

These peptides are transported to the endoplasmic reticulum by the TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) channel, where they are loaded onto MHC class I molecules.\n\nTherefore, the primary function of the protein identified is to bind endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel.",

She also notes having occasional palpitations, nervousness, sweating, and heat intolerance. Her past medical history is unremarkable. She reports a 20-pack-year smoking history and is currently a daily smoker. Physical examination shows an anxious, trembling woman. She has eyelid retraction bilaterally, with an inability to fully close her eyes. Her extraocular motility is limited on upgaze. There is no thyromegaly, and no thyroid nodules are noted. Laboratory studies reveal a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.1 \u03bcU/mL and total T4 of 42 \u03bcg/dL. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin is positive. CT scan of the orbits shows proptosis and marked enlargement of the extraocular muscle with sparing of the tendons. Which of the following would most likely transiently worsen this patient\u2019s eye symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. External orbital radiation\nB. Selenium supplementation\nC. Smoking cessation\nD. Systemic corticosteroids\nE. Treatment with radioactive iodine\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Treatment with radioactive iodine.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism. The eye symptoms, including tearing, foreign body sensation, eyelid retraction, and limited extraocular motility, are due to thyroid-associated orbitopathy (TAO).\n\nRadioactive iodine (RAI) treatment is often used to treat hyperthyroidism, but it can transiently worsen TAO symptoms in some patients. This is because RAI can cause a release of thyroid hormones from the thyroid gland, leading to a temporary increase in inflammation and swelling in the orbits.\n\nThe other options are not likely to worsen the patient's eye symptoms:\n\nA. External orbital radiation may be used to treat TAO, but it is not expected to worsen symptoms.\n\nB. Selenium supplementation has been shown to improve TAO symptoms in some studies.\n\nC. Smoking cessation may actually improve TAO symptoms, as smoking is a risk factor for the development and progression of TAO.\n\nD. Systemic corticosteroids may be used to treat TAO, and they are likely to improve symptoms rather than worsen them.",

A detailed history reveals that there has been no history of urinary incontinence during the day since the boy was 4 years of age, but that he has never been dry at night continuously for 1 week. There is no history of urinary tract infections, urgency, frequency, or hesitancy. On physical examination, the boy\u2019s vital signs are stable. His neurologic and abdominal examinations are completely normal. His laboratory investigations are as follows:\nUrine-specific gravity (first-morning sample) 1.035\nUrine red blood cells Absent\nUrine pus cells Absent\nUrine culture Negative\nWhich of the following is the next step in the management of this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Ultrasonogram of the urinary bladder and kidneys\nB. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine\nC. Reassuring the parents and use of an enuresis alarm\nD. Treatment with oral oxybutynin\nE. Treatment with oral imipramine\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Reassuring the parents and use of an enuresis alarm.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with nocturnal enuresis, also known as bedwetting. The fact that he has never been dry at night continuously for 1 week suggests that this is a primary nocturnal enuresis, rather than a secondary enuresis that occurs after a period of dryness.\n\nThe laboratory investigations rule out any underlying urinary tract infection or kidney disease. The normal physical examination and laboratory results suggest that there is no underlying neurological or anatomical abnormality.\n\nThe next step in management would be to reassure the parents and the child that nocturnal enuresis is a common and treatable condition. An enuresis alarm is a device that is worn on the child's underwear and sounds an alarm when it detects moisture, helping the child to wake up and go to the bathroom. This is a non-invasive and effective treatment for nocturnal enuresis.\n\nOptions A and B are not necessary at this point, as there is no indication of any underlying anatomical or neurological abnormality. Options D and E are medications that may be used to treat nocturnal enuresis, but they are not the first line of treatment and may have side effects.",

The weakness has been progressive to the point where she cannot climb stairs and stand from a sitting position. She has only had one menstrual period in the last four months and has never been pregnant. She smokes a pack of cigarettes every day and does not take any medications. Her temperature is 98\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 15/min. She is obese with a significant pannus. Abdominal striae are present.

The 24-hour urinary cortisol level is elevated, and the serum cortisol level is also high. The low ACTH level suggests that the cortisol excess is not driven by ACTH, which points to an adrenal source.\n\nThe lack of suppression of cortisol levels with high-dose dexamethasone suggests that the cortisol production is autonomous and not regulated by the pituitary gland. This, combined with the low ACTH level, suggests an adrenal tumor or hyperplasia as the likely cause of the Cushing's syndrome.\n\nTherefore, the next step in management would be to image the adrenal glands to look for a tumor or hyperplasia, which is best done with an MRI of the adrenal glands (Option A).",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because she has been feeling very stressed over the past several months. During this period, she has found it difficult to relax. She states that her head is full of worries. She works at an accountant's office and reports difficulty in concentrating on her work. She has been working longer shifts because one of her coworkers is on vacation and reports feeling more tired than usual. She is married and frequently fights with her husband. The patient states that in order to deal with her stress, she goes shopping. While shopping, she steals small trivial items and feels immediately relieved thereafter. She discards the objects she steals and has feelings of shame and guilt about her actions. Her husband is concerned about her behavior, but she is unable to stop shoplifting. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person, place, and time. She reports feeling anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Administration of lithium\nB. Interpersonal therapy\nC. Psychodynamic psychotherapy\nD. Cognitive behavioral therapy\nE. Motivational interviewing\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and behavior are consistent with kleptomania, a disorder characterized by recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal objects that are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value. The patient's feelings of anxiety, stress, and guilt, as well as her inability to stop shoplifting despite her husband's concerns, are all indicative of kleptomania.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that is effective in treating kleptomania. CBT helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to their symptoms. In this case, CBT would help the patient identify the triggers for her shoplifting behavior, such as stress and anxiety, and develop alternative coping mechanisms to manage these feelings.\n\nWhile psychodynamic psychotherapy (option C) may also be helpful in exploring the underlying causes of the patient's behavior, CBT is a more targeted and effective approach for treating kleptomania. Interpersonal therapy (option B) is not specifically indicated for kleptomania, and motivational interviewing (option E) is typically used for substance abuse disorders. Lithium (option A) is a medication used to treat bipolar disorder and is not indicated for kleptomania.",

Initially, the patient was noted to be behaving inappropriately including using foul language and grabbing people unexpectedly. This has progressed to a worsening of his memory and trouble caring for himself. His temperature is 98.1\u00b0F (36.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 162/103 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an elderly man who laughs inappropriately at times and who is a poor historian. When he is engaged in conversation, he exhibits word finding difficulty and is rather inattentive. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Alzheimer dementia\nB. Frontotemporal dementia\nC. Kluver-Bucy syndrome\nD. Lewy body dementia\nE. Vascular dementia\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Frontotemporal dementia.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as inappropriate behavior, language disturbances, and lack of empathy, are consistent with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). FTD is a group of disorders that affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, leading to changes in personality, behavior, and language. The patient's symptoms, including the use of foul language, grabbing people unexpectedly, and laughing inappropriately, are characteristic of the behavioral variant of FTD.\n\nAlzheimer dementia (A) typically presents with memory impairment and cognitive decline, but not the same level of behavioral changes seen in this patient. Kluver-Bucy syndrome (C) is a rare condition that results from damage to the temporal lobes, leading to hypersexuality, hypermetamorphosis, and other symptoms not seen in this patient. Lewy body dementia (D) is characterized by fluctuations in cognition, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonian symptoms, which are not prominent in this patient. Vascular dementia (E) is caused by cerebrovascular disease and typically presents with a stepwise decline in cognitive function, which is not consistent with this patient's symptoms.",

Vital signs include: temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. The rash features thin-walled, fluid-filled blisters that rupture easily. Fluid samples from the lesions are sent for analysis to a microbiology lab. The results reveal an infection by the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is diagnosed with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Which of the following is involved with the primary defense in response to the bacteria and toxins produced by this organism?\nOptions:\nA. Immunoglobulin- IgG\nB. Immunoglobulin- IgE\nC. Immunoglobulin- IgD\nD. Immunoglobulin- IgA\nE. Immunoglobulin- IgM\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Immunoglobulin- IgA.\n\nStaphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a toxin-mediated disease caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The primary defense against this organism and its toxins is the mucosal immune system, which involves IgA antibodies. IgA is the primary immunoglobulin found in mucosal surfaces, such as the skin and respiratory tract, and plays a key role in neutralizing toxins and preventing bacterial colonization.\n\nIgG (Option A) is involved in the secondary immune response and provides long-term immunity against infections. IgE (Option B) is involved in allergic reactions and is not primarily involved in defense against bacterial infections. IgD (Option C) is found on the surface of mature B cells and helps activate the immune response, but it is not directly involved in defense against S. aureus. IgM (Option E) is the first antibody produced in response to an infection, but it is not the primary defense against S. aureus toxins.",

Upon further questioning, he reports that he took more medication four hours ago because he was hearing voices. Which of the following should most likely be administered to this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Glycopyrrolate\nB. Benztropine\nC. Levodopa\nD. Dantrolene\nE. Propranolol\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Benztropine.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including neck stiffness, inability to move his neck, and contraction of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, are consistent with acute dystonic reaction, a known side effect of antipsychotic medications. The patient's history of schizophrenia and taking an unknown medication suggests that he may be taking an antipsychotic. Benztropine is an anticholinergic medication that is commonly used to treat acute dystonic reactions. It can help relieve the muscle spasms and stiffness associated with this condition.",

Acute pancreatitis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including hepatosplenomegaly and a milky venous blood sample that forms a creamy supernatant layer after refrigeration, are consistent with chylomicronemia syndrome, a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of lipoprotein lipase or its cofactor, apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2). This deficiency leads to the accumulation of chylomicrons in the blood, causing hypertriglyceridemia.\n\nOne of the major complications of chylomicronemia syndrome is acute pancreatitis, which occurs in up to 20% of patients. The high levels of triglycerides in the blood can cause inflammation of the pancreas, leading to pancreatitis.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to chylomicronemia syndrome:\n\nB.

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 41-year-old man comes to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea for the past 2 days. His abdominal discomfort is worse shortly after meals. He has also had progressive perioral numbness and upper-extremity muscle cramping for the past 24 hours. Six months ago, he underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to treat obesity. He underwent a total thyroidectomy to treat a Hurthle cell lesion 4 days ago. His mother died of lung cancer at age 68. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. His only current medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes spasm of the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck. The abdomen is mildly tender to palpation with well-healed laparoscopic incisional sites. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:\nNa+ 138 mEq/L\nK+ 4.2 mEq/L\nCl- 102 mEq/L\nHCO3- 25 mEq/L\nMg2+ 1.7 mEq/L\nPhosphorus 4.3 mg/dL\n25-hydroxyvitamin D 20 ng/mL (N: 20-100 ng/mL)\nParathyroid hormone 115 pg/mL\nTotal bilirubin, serum 0.7 mg/dL\nAlanine aminotransferase, serum 14 U/L\nAspartate aminotransferase, serum 15 U/L\nAlkaline phosphatase, serum 42 U/L\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient?\"\nOptions:\nA. Obtain abdominal CT\nB. Observation only\nC. Begin rehydration therapy\nD. Administer calcium gluconate\nE. Supplementation with vitamin D\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Administer calcium gluconate.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including perioral numbness, upper-extremity muscle cramping, and spasm of the hand, are consistent with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels). The patient's recent total thyroidectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery increase the risk of hypocalcemia due to parathyroid gland injury or malabsorption of calcium. The patient's parathyroid hormone level is elevated, indicating that the parathyroid glands are responding to low calcium levels, but are unable to normalize them.\n\nAdministering calcium gluconate is the most appropriate initial step in managing this patient's symptoms. Rehydration therapy (option C) may be necessary, but it is not the primary concern. Abdominal CT (option A) is not indicated, as the patient's abdominal symptoms are likely related to the hypocalcemia rather than an underlying abdominal pathology. Observation only (option B) is not sufficient, as the patient's symptoms require prompt treatment. Vitamin D supplementation (option E) may be necessary in the long term, but it will not immediately address the patient's acute symptoms.",

The mother mentions that her boy is always tired, and seems to be getting worse. He prefers watching television rather than going out and playing with other kids. Furthermore, he has had frequent episodes of constipation since birth. Except for frequent cravings for salty foods, the boy eats a regular diet. The patient was delivered healthy and is fully immunized. The medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications. He has no siblings. His father is a banker and his mother is a librarian. The pulse is 90/min, the blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 15/min. He is in the bottom 10th percentile for height and weight according to his age. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. He recently had a urinalysis that showed elevated urinary calcium excretion.\nAdditional lab testing results are as follows:\nSerum electrolytes\nSodium 135 mEq/L\nPotassium 3.2 mEq/L\nChloride 95 mEq/L\nPlasma renin activity 10 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5\u20133.3 ng/mL/hr)\nPlasma aldosterone concentration 20 ng/dL (normal, 2\u20139 ng/dL)\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA.

Bartter's syndrome.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as generalized weakness, increased urination, and increased thirst, are consistent with a diagnosis of Bartter's syndrome. The presence of frequent episodes of constipation since birth and the patient's preference for salty foods also support this diagnosis.\n\nThe laboratory results, including the low potassium level, elevated plasma renin activity, and elevated plasma aldosterone concentration, are also consistent with Bartter's syndrome. The elevated urinary calcium excretion is another characteristic feature of this condition.\n\nBartter's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the kidneys and leads to excessive loss of potassium and sodium in the urine. It is characterized by hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and elevated plasma renin and aldosterone levels.\n\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism (option B) is unlikely because it typically presents with hypertension, which is not seen in this patient. Renal artery stenosis (option A) is also unlikely because it typically presents with hypertension and would not explain the patient's hypokalemia and elevated plasma renin and aldosterone levels. Pheochromocytoma (option D) is unlikely because it typically presents with hypertension, tachycardia, and other symptoms not seen in this patient. Gitelman's syndrome (option E) is a similar condition to Bartter's syndrome, but it typically presents with hypocalciuria (low urinary calcium excretion), which is not seen in this patient.",

At presentation, the patient\u2019s vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals slight jaundice and pale conjunctiva. The spleen is tender and easily palpable. After a complete blood count with differential and an abdominal ultrasound, the patient is found to have sickle-cell disease with splenic infarct. A partial splenectomy is performed. After the operation, the physician provides vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

It is determined that patients have a 4-year asymptomatic period prior to developing clinical symptoms from this adrenal cancer. A new screening test is developed, and the cancer can now be detected 2 years prior to developing clinical symptoms. A new observational case-control study of screened and unscreened patients measures the median 5-year survival of patients who decline medical and surgical treatment. The screened population has statistically better outcomes. Which step should be undertaken to prevent bias in these conclusions?\nOptions:\nA. Using survival rates in the analysis\nB. Using mortality rates in the analysis\nC. Analyzing the results by age of diagnosis\nD. Increasing the number of screened individuals\nE. Decreasing the number of screened individuals\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Using mortality rates in the analysis.\n\nThe study is prone to lead-time bias, which occurs when a screening test detects a disease earlier than it would have been diagnosed clinically, but does not change the natural course of the disease. In this case, the screening test detects the cancer 2 years prior to developing clinical symptoms, which may artificially inflate the survival rate of the screened population.\n\nTo prevent this bias, the study should use mortality rates instead of survival rates. Mortality rates are less susceptible to lead-time bias, as they measure the proportion of patients who die from the disease, rather than the time from diagnosis to death. By using mortality rates, the study can get a more accurate estimate of the effect of screening on patient outcomes.",

Decrease in urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids\nC. Decrease in serum 11-deoxycortisol\nD. Increase in serum cortisol\nE. Increase in urine metanephrines\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Increase in serum ACTH.\n\nMetyrapone is a medication that inhibits the enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxylase, which is necessary for the production of cortisol in the adrenal glands. When metyrapone is administered, it blocks the production of cortisol, leading to an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion from the pituitary gland. This is because the pituitary gland senses the decrease in cortisol levels and responds by increasing ACTH production to stimulate the adrenal glands to produce more cortisol.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nB. Urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids would actually increase, not decrease, because metyrapone shunts the production of cortisol towards the 17-hydroxycorticosteroid pathway.\n\nC. Serum 11-deoxycortisol would increase, not decrease, because metyrapone blocks the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol.\n\nD. Serum cortisol would decrease, not increase, because metyrapone inhibits cortisol production.\n\nE. Urine metanephrines are not directly related to the effects of metyrapone on cortisol production.",

He is sexually active with one female partner and does not use condoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a tender right testicle; lifting it provides relief. The penis appears normal, with no discharge at the meatus. Laboratory studies show a normal complete blood count; urinalysis shows 3 WBC/hpf.

Chlamydia trachomatis infection\nE. Varicocele\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Chlamydia trachomatis infection.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including right-sided scrotal pain, burning sensation on urination, and increased urinary frequency, are consistent with epididymitis, which is an inflammation of the epididymis, a tube-like structure behind the testicle that stores sperm. The physical examination findings, including a tender right testicle and relief of pain with elevation, also support this diagnosis.\n\nThe laboratory studies, including a normal complete blood count and urinalysis with 3 WBC/hpf, suggest an inflammatory process rather than an infectious one. The Gram stain of a urethral swab showing polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no organisms is also consistent with epididymitis.\n\nThe testicular ultrasound showing increased blood flow to the right testicle compared to the left suggests inflammation and rules out testicular torsion, which would show decreased blood flow.\n\nChlamydia trachomatis is a common cause of epididymitis in sexually active young men, and the patient's history of being sexually active with one female partner and not using condoms makes this diagnosis likely. Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection (Option A) is also a possible cause of epididymitis, but the Gram stain would likely show gram-negative diplococci. Treponema pallidum infection (Option C) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Further evaluation including biopsy confirms the diagnosis of intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. The physician recommends the established standard treatment, which is initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, the likelihood of unresectability without neoadjuvant treatment, and the prognosis without it, the patient's parents steadily refuse chemotherapy because they do not want their son to suffer the side effects.

Arranging supportive care at home would not address the underlying condition and would likely lead to the child's deterioration.\n\nB. Referring the patient to another oncologist would not change the fact that the parents are refusing necessary treatment.\n\nC. Giving the parents time to think about their decision may not change their minds, and delaying treatment could worsen the child's prognosis.\n\nE.

He says that the pain often worsens when he tries to sleep on his left side. Although he tried several pain medications, none of the pain medications helped. He is an amateur tennis player who practices on weekends. He denies any trauma during his practice sessions. On examination of the shoulder joint, severe tenderness was present localized to the greater tuberosity of the left shoulder joint along with biceps tendon tenderness over the bicipital groove. The range of motion was limited to the left side. An X-ray of the joint showed narrowing of the acromiohumeral space with sclerosis and spurring of the acromion.

He reports that, about once per month for the past 8 or 9 months, he's had episodes of \"feeling like my chest is going to explode.\" During these episodes, he also feels shortness of breath, feels shakiness throughout his arms and legs, and sweats so heavily that he needs to change his shirt. He is unsure of any clear precipitating factors but thinks they may occur more often around important exams or when big school projects are due. He shares that, as these episodes continue to recur, he has had mounting anxiety about having one when he is in class or at a restaurant. As a result, he is leaving the house less and less. He has no past medical history; the physical exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is the best medication for the long-term management of this patient's condition?\nOptions:\nA. Citalopram\nB. Lithium\nC. Lorazepam\nD. Propranolol\nE. Quetiapine\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Citalopram.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with panic disorder, which is characterized by recurrent panic attacks, anxiety about having future attacks, and avoidance of situations where attacks may occur. The patient's physical symptoms, such as chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and shakiness, are typical of panic attacks. The fact that the episodes seem to occur more frequently around stressful events, such as exams or projects, also supports this diagnosis.\n\nCitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is commonly used to treat panic disorder. It has been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of panic attacks, as well as alleviating anxiety and depression.\n\nLorazepam (C) is a benzodiazepine that can be used to treat panic disorder, but it is not a good choice for long-term management due to its potential for dependence and withdrawal symptoms.\n\nPropranolol (D) is a beta blocker that can be used to treat performance anxiety, but it is not typically used to treat panic disorder.\n\nQuetiapine (E) is an antipsychotic medication that is not typically used to treat panic disorder.\n\nLithium (B) is a mood stabilizer that is not typically used to treat panic disorder.\n\nTherefore, the best medication for the long-term management of this patient's condition is citalopram (A).",

Among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, cART adherence was a significant predictor of DLBCL risk (RR = 0.52, p = 0.01). However, among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3, no relationship was found between DLBCL risk and cART adherence (RR = 0.96, p = 0.36).

Effect modification.\n\nThe difference in the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk between the two strata (CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3 and above 200/mm3) suggests that the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk is modified by the CD4+ cell count at the time of diagnosis. In other words, the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk is different depending on the level of CD4+ cell count. This is an example of effect modification, where the effect of an exposure (cART adherence) on an outcome (DLBCL risk) is influenced by a third variable (CD4+ cell count).",

It is eliminated primarily through renal excretion, with approximately 80% of the dose eliminated unchanged in the urine.\n\nThe fact that the subject is eliminating 0.5 mg of the drug every 4 hours suggests a first-order elimination process, which is consistent with dabigatran's pharmacokinetics.\n\nWarfarin (A) is a vitamin K antagonist that has a longer half-life (around 36-48 hours) and is eliminated through a different mechanism.\n\nEnoxaparin (B) and fondaparinux (D) are low-molecular-weight heparins that are eliminated primarily through renal excretion, but they have shorter half-lives (around 4-6 hours) and are not typically associated with a predictable elimination rate of 0.5 mg every 4 hours.\n\nApixaban (E) is a direct factor Xa inhibitor that has a half-life of around 12 hours, but its elimination profile is not consistent with the described pattern.\n\nTherefore, based on the elimination pattern, dabigatran (C) is the most likely anticoagulant consumed by the subject.",

Parkinson disease\nC. Polycystic ovarian syndrome\nD. Premature labor\nE. Prostate cancer\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Polycystic ovarian syndrome.\n\nThe scenario described suggests that the woman is being treated for infertility, and the treatment is being administered one week before her normal menstrual cycle. This is consistent with the use of clomiphene citrate, a medication commonly used to stimulate ovulation in women with infertility.\n\nIf clomiphene citrate were administered in a different manner, it could also be used to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder that can cause infertility, irregular periods, and other symptoms. Clomiphene citrate is sometimes used to induce ovulation in women with PCOS.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the treatment of infertility or PCOS:\n\nA. Diabetes is a metabolic disorder that is not typically treated with clomiphene citrate.\n\nB. Parkinson disease is a neurological disorder that is not related to clomiphene citrate.\n\nD.

Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and test results suggest a diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), which is a condition in which urine flows backward from the bladder into the kidneys, causing damage to the kidneys over time. The renal ultrasound shows bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis, which is consistent with VUR.

The patient is quite anxious about the implications of this diagnosis. Her physical examination is within normal limits. Her vital signs do not show any abnormalities at this time. Her past medical, family, and social histories are all non-contributory. Which of the following is the appropriate management of a newly diagnosed CIN I in a 24-year-old patient?\nOptions:\nA. Close observation, pap smear screening at 6 and 12 months, and HPV DNA testing at 12 months\nB. Cryotherapy ablation\nC. Laser ablation\nD. Loop electrosurgical excision (LEEP)\nE. Hysterectomy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Close observation, pap smear screening at 6 and 12 months, and HPV DNA testing at 12 months.\n\nCIN I is a mild dysplasia, and the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) guidelines recommend conservative management for young women with CIN I. This includes close observation with pap smear screening at 6 and 12 months, and HPV DNA testing at 12 months. This approach allows for monitoring of the lesion and detection of any potential progression to higher-grade lesions.\n\nThe other options are not appropriate for a 24-year-old patient with CIN I:\n\nB. Cryotherapy ablation and C. Laser ablation are treatment options for CIN II and CIN III, not CIN I.\n\nD. Loop electrosurgical excision (LEEP) is a treatment option for CIN II and CIN III, and may be considered for CIN I if the lesion is persistent or progresses to a higher grade.\n\nE. Hysterectomy is not indicated for CIN I, as it is a mild dysplasia that can be managed conservatively. Hysterectomy is typically reserved for more advanced cervical cancer or other gynecologic conditions.",

Darunavir has been particularly efficacious in recent patients; however, some have experienced an increased incidence of hyperglycemia. A new drug called DN501 is developed with the same mechanism of action as darunavir but fewer side effects. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of DN501?\nOptions:\nA. Prevents viral transcription\nB. Inhibits viral assembly\nC. Inhibits integration of viral genome into the host cell\nD. Inhibits viral entry\nE. Prevents T-cell binding\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Inhibits integration of viral genome into the host cell.\n\nDarunavir is a protease inhibitor, which means it works by inhibiting the protease enzyme that HIV uses to cleave its polyproteins into functional proteins. However, darunavir's mechanism of action is actually to inhibit the protease enzyme that is necessary for the maturation of the viral particles, not to inhibit integration of the viral genome into the host cell.\n\nThe correct mechanism of action of darunavir is not among the options. But, based on the information provided, it is likely that DN501 has the same mechanism of action as darunavir, which is to inhibit the protease enzyme.\n\nIt's worth noting that the options provided are not accurate mechanisms of action for darunavir or DN501.

Initiation of G0 phase\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Initiation of S phase.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* Drug X activates cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), which is a key regulator of the cell cycle.\n* CDK4 phosphorylates and inactivates the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, a tumor suppressor that normally inhibits cell cycle progression.\n* When Rb is inactivated, the cell cycle is allowed to progress from the G1 phase to the S phase, where DNA replication occurs.\n* Therefore, the administration of drug X would likely lead to an increase in the number of cells in the S phase, as the cells are able to overcome the G1/S checkpoint and enter the S phase.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* A. G1 phase arrest would occur if the Rb protein were activated, not inactivated.\n* B. Prophase I arrest is not related to the Rb gene or CDK4.\n* D. Completion of G2 phase is not directly related to the action of drug X on the Rb gene.\n* E. Initiation of G0 phase is not a possible outcome, as G0 is a quiescent state that cells enter when they are not actively dividing, and drug X is promoting cell cycle progression.",

He also says he has been having intermittent fevers and severe night sweats which require a change of bed sheets the next day. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosed 10 years ago with which he admits to not always being compliant with his antiretroviral medication. The patient reports a 20-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a 6 kg (13.2 lb) unintentional weight loss over the past 2 months. The vital signs include: temperature 37.8\u2103 (100.0\u2109) and blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, there are multiple non-tender swollen lymph nodes averaging 2 cm in diameter that is palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. Axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present on the right side. A cardiopulmonary exam is unremarkable. The spleen size is 16 cm on percussion. Laboratory studies show the following:\nHemoglobin 9 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume 88 \u03bcm3\nLeukocyte count 18,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 130,000/mm3\n    Serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL\nSerum lactate dehydrogenase 1,000 U/L\nAn excisional biopsy of a superficial axillary lymph node on the right is performed and a histopathologic analysis confirms the most likely diagnosis. Which of the following is the next best diagnostic step in the workup of this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Antinuclear antibody\nB. Hepatitis C virus antibodies\nC. JAK-2 mutation\nD. Peripheral blood flow cytometry\nE. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Peripheral blood flow cytometry.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of lymphoma, likely diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) given the presence of fever, night sweats, and weight loss, as well as the laboratory findings of anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The excisional biopsy of the lymph node confirms the diagnosis.\n\nThe next step in the workup would be to perform peripheral blood flow cytometry to assess for bone marrow involvement and to determine the extent of disease. This test would help to identify any abnormal cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, which is important for staging and treatment planning.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the diagnosis or workup of lymphoma:\n\nA. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) is a test for autoimmune disorders, which is not relevant to this patient's presentation.\n\nB. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies may be relevant in the context of HIV infection, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms and diagnosis.\n\nC. JAK-2 mutation is a test for myeloproliferative neoplasms, which is not suspected in this patient.\n\nE. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test is a test for hairy cell leukemia, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation and biopsy results.",

Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?\nOptions:\nA. Lack of a comparison group\nB. No prevalence assessment\nC. Low number of patients\nD. Ascertainment bias\nE. Lack of risk calculation\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Lack of a comparison group.\n\nThe editor suggested that the study should be submitted as a case series instead of a cohort study because it lacks a comparison group. A cohort study typically involves comparing a group of patients who receive a particular treatment or intervention (in this case, cerclage wiring) to a control group that does not receive the treatment. The study in question only followed a single group of patients who received the treatment, without a control group for comparison. This lack of a comparison group is a key characteristic of a case series, which is a descriptive study that reports on a series of patients with a particular condition or treatment, without comparing them to a control group.",

She has had spotting during the last 3 days. Her medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 89/65 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a dilated cervical os and a uterus consistent in size with an 11-week gestation. Ultrasonography shows an embryo of 4 cm in crown-rump length and no fetal cardiac activity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Misoprostol therapy\nB. Follow-up ultrasonography\nC. Methotrexate therapy\nD. Dilation and curettage\nE. Complete bed rest\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Dilation and curettage.\n\nThe patient is experiencing vaginal bleeding and suprapubic pain, and the ultrasound shows an embryo with no fetal cardiac activity, indicating a missed abortion. The most appropriate next step in management is to perform a dilation and curettage (D&C) to evacuate the nonviable pregnancy tissue from the uterus. This will help to prevent further bleeding and infection, and allow the patient to physically and emotionally recover from the pregnancy loss.\n\nMisoprostol therapy (Option A) is not indicated in this scenario, as it is typically used to induce labor or treat postpartum hemorrhage, not to manage a missed abortion.\n\nFollow-up ultrasonography (Option B) may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but it is not the next step in management.\n\nMethotrexate therapy (Option C) is used to treat ectopic pregnancies, not missed abortions.\n\nComplete bed rest (Option E) is not a necessary or effective treatment for a missed abortion, and may not prevent further bleeding or complications.",

The past year the child has been admitted to the hospital 3 times with pneumonia. For the past 1 week, the child has been experiencing thick purulent cough and says that her chest feels \u2018heavy\u2019. Her stools have been loose and foul-smelling over the past week. Her parents are also concerned that she has not gained much weight due to her frequent hospital visits.

Dysfunction in a transmembrane regulator.\n\nThe symptoms described, including persistent cough, fever, vomiting, and recurrent pneumonia, are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). The presence of a nasal polyp and foul-smelling stools also support this diagnosis. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a dysfunction in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which regulates the transport of salt and water in and out of cells. This leads to thick, sticky mucus that clogs the airways and digestive tract, causing the symptoms described.",

He says that he finds it difficult to walk a few blocks and has to rest. He also complains of a cough for the past 3 months, which is dry and hacking in nature. The medical history is relevant for an idiopathic arrhythmia for which he takes amiodarone daily. He is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. He denies any use of illicit drugs.

The other options do not typically cause this type of acid-base disorder.\n\nTrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (A) can cause a type 3 RTA, but it is less likely to cause a type 1 RTA.\n\nAcetazolamide (B) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that can cause a metabolic acidosis, but it would not typically cause a type 1 RTA.\n\nEplerenone (C) is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can cause hyperkalemia, but it is not typically associated with metabolic acidosis or RTA.\n\nHeparin (E) is an anticoagulant that is not typically associated with metabolic acidosis or RTA.",

He reports that he graduated from college last month and returned 3 days ago from a 2 week vacation to Vietnam and Cambodia. For the past 2 days, he has developed a worsening headache, malaise, and pain in his hands and wrists. The patient has a past medical history of asthma managed with albuterol as needed. He is sexually active with both men and women, and he uses condoms \u201cmost of the time.\u201d On physical exam, the patient\u2019s temperature is 102.5\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 112/66 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. He has tenderness to palpation over his bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints and a maculopapular rash on his trunk and upper thighs. Tourniquet test is negative. Laboratory results are as follows:\n\nHemoglobin: 14 g/dL\nHematocrit: 44%\nLeukocyte count: 3,200/mm^3\nPlatelet count: 112,000/mm^3\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 142 mEq/L\nCl-: 104 mEq/L\nK+: 4.6 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nBUN: 18 mg/dL\nGlucose: 87 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 0.9 mg/dL\nAST: 106 U/L\nALT: 112 U/L\nBilirubin (total): 0.8 mg/dL\nBilirubin (conjugated): 0.3 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?\nOptions:\nA.

Dengue fever.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as headache, malaise, and joint pain, are consistent with dengue fever. The physical exam findings, including a maculopapular rash and tenderness to palpation over the metacarpophalangeal joints, also support this diagnosis. The laboratory results, including thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) and mild elevation of liver enzymes, are also consistent with dengue fever.\n\nChikungunya (Option A) is also a possibility, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are more consistent with dengue fever. Epstein-Barr virus (Option C) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Hepatitis A (Option D) is also unlikely, as the patient's liver enzyme elevations are mild and the patient does not have a history of exposure to contaminated food or water. Typhoid fever (Option E) is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not match the typical presentation of typhoid fever.",

Her blood cultures are positive for Escherichia coli, for which she has been receiving appropriate antibiotics since admission. She has no history of any serious illness. She does not use illicit drugs. Current medications include norepinephrine, ceftriaxone, and acetaminophen. She appears well. Her temperature is 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), heart rate is 96/min, and blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. Examination of the back shows costovertebral tenderness bilaterally.

Treating the underlying illness\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Levothyroxine.\n\nThe patient's laboratory results show a low free T3 level (0.1 ng/dL) and a low-normal free T4 level (0.9 ng/dL), indicating hypothyroidism. The normal TSH level (1.8 \u00b5U/mL) suggests that the hypothyroidism is not due to primary thyroid failure, but rather due to a non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), also known as sick euthyroid syndrome. This is a common condition seen in critically ill patients, where the thyroid hormone levels are decreased due to the illness itself, rather than a primary thyroid problem.\n\nIn this case, the patient's hypotension and septic shock are likely contributing to the NTIS. Treatment with levothyroxine (B) is indicated to support the patient's thyroid function and potentially improve her hemodynamic status.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist that is used to treat hyperprolactinemia, not hypothyroidism.\n\nC. Removing toxic drugs is not relevant in this case, as the patient's medications (norepinephrine, ceftriaxone, and acetaminophen) are not known to cause hypothyroidism.\n\nD. Thiamine therapy is not indicated for hypothyroidism.\n\nE. Treating the underlying illness (septic shock and bacteremia) is important, but it will not directly address the patient's hypothyroidism.",

Metronidazole and paromomycin\nB. Antifungal therapy\nC. Cholecystectomy\nD. Antibiotics and drainage\nE. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Antibiotics and drainage.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a diagnosis of liver abscess, which is supported by the abdominal ultrasonography findings. The patient's history of diabetes mellitus and the presence of a tender liver edge that is palpable below the right costal margin are consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nThe best initial step in management is to administer antibiotics and perform drainage of the abscess. This is because liver abscesses are typically polymicrobial, and antibiotics can help to control the infection. Drainage of the abscess is also necessary to remove the infected material and promote healing.\n\nMetronidazole and paromomycin (Option A) are not the best initial step, as they are typically used to treat amebic liver abscesses, which is not the likely diagnosis in this case given the negative stool test for Entamoeba histolytica antigen.\n\nAntifungal therapy (Option B) is not indicated, as there is no evidence to suggest a fungal infection.\n\nCholecystectomy (Option C) is not necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a liver abscess than with gallbladder disease.\n\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (Option E) is not the best initial step, as it is typically used to diagnose and treat bile duct obstruction, which is not the primary concern in this case.",

His temperature is 97.8\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 127/72 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 19/min. On exam, he has a firm, symmetric, and stone-firm thyroid. A biopsy of this patient's lesion would most likely demonstrate which of the following findings?\nOptions:\nA. Diffuse infiltrate of lymphoid cells destroying thyroid follicles\nB. Dense fibroinflammatory infiltrate\nC. Papillary projections with dystrophically calcified regions\nD. Pleomorphic undifferentiated infiltrative cells with necrosis\nE. Stromal amyloid deposition\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Stromal amyloid deposition.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). The presence of a firm, symmetric, and stone-hard thyroid gland, along with a family history of MTC, suggests this diagnosis. MTC is a type of thyroid cancer that arises from the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland and is often associated with amyloid deposition in the stroma. A biopsy of the lesion would likely demonstrate stromal amyloid deposition, which is a characteristic feature of MTC.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A group of researchers decided to explore whether the estimates of incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were influenced by the number of years it took to examine administrative data. These estimates were not only based on hospital discharges, but also on physician billing codes. For study purposes, the researchers labeled incident cases at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases were those that were coded as harboring SLE at any time, with patients maintaining their diagnosis until death. Which statement is true regarding the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study?\nOptions:\nA. Examining successively longer time periods will result in substantially lower prevalence estimates.\nB. Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.\nC. The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.\nD. The inclusion of attack rates would increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.\nE. The inclusion of attack rates would decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* Incidence rates measure the number of new cases of a disease (in this case, SLE) that occur within a specific time period. Prevalence rates, on the other hand, measure the total number of existing cases of a disease within a specific time period.\n* When examining shorter time periods, the prevalence of SLE will be overestimated because it will include cases that may have been diagnosed in previous time periods, but are still active. This means that the prevalence rate will be artificially inflated.\n* As the time period increases, the prevalence rate will become more accurate, as it will capture a more complete picture of all existing cases of SLE.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\n* A. Examining successively longer time periods will result in higher prevalence estimates, not lower ones.\n* B. Incidence rates are not necessarily higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.\n* D. Attack rates are not relevant to this study, and their inclusion would not increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.\n* E. Attack rates are not relevant to this study, and their inclusion would not decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.",

She has had progressive shortness of breath over the last year with an intermittent non-productive cough. In addition, she complains of difficulty raising her arms to brush her hair. Her temperature is 99.6\u00b0F (37.6\u00b0C), pulse is 80/min, blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Neurologic exam shows 4/5 strength in the deltoid muscles bilaterally. Diffuse dry crackles are heard on lung auscultation. A faint erythematous rash is noted on the malar cheeks, periorbital areas, lateral proximal thighs, and the elbows. Which of the following tests is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Muscle biopsy\nB. CT scan\nC. Pulmonary function tests\nD. Serum ANA titer\nE. Skin biopsy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Serum ANA titer.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of dermatomyositis, an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation of the skin and muscles. The presence of a rash on the malar cheeks, periorbital areas, lateral proximal thighs, and elbows, along with muscle weakness and shortness of breath, suggests this diagnosis.\n\nA serum ANA (antinuclear antibody) titer is a common test used to confirm the diagnosis of dermatomyositis. ANA is a type of autoantibody that is often present in the blood of patients with autoimmune diseases, including dermatomyositis. A positive ANA titer would support the diagnosis of dermatomyositis.\n\nWhile muscle biopsy (A) may also be useful in diagnosing dermatomyositis, it is a more invasive procedure and may not be necessary if the ANA titer is positive. A CT scan (B) may be useful in evaluating the patient's lung disease, but it would not confirm the diagnosis of dermatomyositis. Pulmonary function tests (C) may be useful in assessing the patient's lung function, but they would not be diagnostic for dermatomyositis. A skin biopsy (E) may be useful in evaluating the patient's rash, but it would not be as specific for dermatomyositis as a positive ANA titer.",

The patient\u2019s mother is concerned that the patient is a picky eater and often returns home from school with most of her packed lunch uneaten. The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for moderate persistent asthma, which has required three separate week-long courses of prednisone over the last year and recently diagnosed myopia. The patient\u2019s mother is 5\u20197\u201d, and the patient\u2019s father is 5\u201910\u201d.

The liver is palpated 2\u20133 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpated 1\u20132 cm below the left costal margin. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 49/mm3 (N \u2265 500 mm3). Blood cultures grow acid-fast organisms. A PPD skin test shows 4 mm of induration. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?\nOptions:\nA. Voriconazole\nB. Amphotericin B and itraconazole\nC. Erythromycin\nD. Azithromycin and ethambutol\nE. Rifampin and isoniazid\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Azithromycin and ethambutol.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. The growth of acid-fast organisms in blood cultures and the patient's low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count support this diagnosis.\n\nAzithromycin and ethambutol are the recommended treatment for disseminated MAC infection in patients with AIDS. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is effective against MAC, and ethambutol is an antimycobacterial agent that is often used in combination with azithromycin to treat MAC infection.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Voriconazole is an antifungal agent used to treat fungal infections, not mycobacterial infections.\n\nB. Amphotericin B and itraconazole are used to treat fungal infections, not mycobacterial infections.\n\nC. Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic, but it is not as effective as azithromycin against MAC.\n\nE. Rifampin and isoniazid are used to treat tuberculosis, not MAC infection.",

Two weeks ago, she had a routine Pap smear that showed atypical squamous cells. Colposcopy shows an area of white discoloration of the cervix with application of acetic acid solution. Biopsy of this area shows carcinoma-in-situ. Activation of which of the following best explains the pathogenesis of this condition?\nOptions:\nA. Phosphoprotein p24\nB. JAK2 tyrosine kinase\nC. E2F transcription factors\nD. Phosphoprotein p53\nE. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. E2F transcription factors.\n\nCarcinoma-in-situ, a precursor to cervical cancer, is often caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV proteins E6 and E7 interact with and inactivate the tumor suppressor proteins p53 and Rb, respectively. This leads to the activation of E2F transcription factors, which promote cell proliferation and contribute to the development of cervical cancer.\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Phosphoprotein p24 is a protein associated with HIV, not cervical cancer.\n\nB. JAK2 tyrosine kinase is involved in signal transduction pathways, but it's not directly related to the pathogenesis of cervical cancer.\n\nD. Phosphoprotein p53 is a tumor suppressor protein that is inactivated by HPV E6 protein, but it's not the one that's activated in the pathogenesis of cervical cancer.\n\nE. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are involved in cell cycle regulation, but they're not directly related to the pathogenesis of cervical cancer.",

In a pilot study of 50 patients, the imaging test detected the presence of CMV retinitis in 50% of the patients. An ophthalmologist slit lamp examination, which was performed for each patient to serve as the gold standard for diagnosis, confirmed a diagnosis of CMV retinitis in 20 patients that were found to be positive through imaging, as well as 1 patient who tested negative with the device. If the prevalence of CMV retinitis in the population decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, how will positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the diagnostic test be affected?\nOptions:\nA. PPV decreases, NPV decreases\nB. PPV decreases, NPV increases\nC. PPV increases, NPV decreases\nD. PPV increases, NPV increases\nE. PPV unchanged, NPV unchanged\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. PPV decreases, NPV increases.\n\nWhen the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases, the number of true positives (patients with the disease who test positive) will decrease, while the number of false positives (patients without the disease who test positive) will remain relatively constant. This will decrease the positive predictive value (PPV), which is the proportion of patients with a positive test result who actually have the disease.\n\nOn the other hand, the number of true negatives (patients without the disease who test negative) will increase, while the number of false negatives (patients with the disease who test negative) will remain relatively constant. This will increase the negative predictive value (NPV), which is the proportion of patients with a negative test result who do not have the disease.\n\nTherefore, as the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases, the PPV will decrease, and the NPV will increase.",

She vaguely explains that the necklace is to mask her scent from the moles tracking her. She has no past psychiatric history and she denies hearing voices or seeing objects. No significant past medical history. Although she has lived in the same community for years, she says she usually keeps to herself and does not have many friends. She holds a regular job at the local hardware store and lives alone. Which of the following is the best initial course of treatment for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)\nB. The patient does not require any intervention\nC. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)\nD. A brief trial of antipsychotic therapy\nE. Refer to outpatient group therapy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. A brief trial of antipsychotic therapy.\n\nThe patient's behavior and beliefs, such as setting up bear traps to protect herself from \"mole people\" and wearing a garlic necklace to mask her scent, suggest a delusional disorder. Delusional disorders are characterized by the presence of non-bizarre delusions that are not better explained by another mental disorder, such as schizophrenia. In this case, the patient's delusions are not accompanied by hallucinations or other symptoms that would suggest a different diagnosis.\n\nA brief trial of antipsychotic therapy is a reasonable initial course of treatment for this patient. Antipsychotic medications, such as risperidone or olanzapine, can help to reduce the severity of delusions and improve the patient's functioning.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may also be helpful in addressing the patient's delusions and improving her coping skills, but it is not the best initial course of treatment. The patient does not require electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) at this point, and referring her to outpatient group therapy may not be sufficient to address her delusional beliefs. Finally, the patient's symptoms do require intervention, so option B is not correct.",

The patient reports that he first noticed the swelling several weeks ago, but it is not always present. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. His father was diagnosed with a seminoma at the age of 25 years. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 10-cm, soft, cystic, nontender right scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?\nOptions:\nA. Patent processus vaginalis\nB. Dilation of the pampiniform plexus\nC. Twisting of the spermatic cord\nD. Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis\nE. Impaired lymphatic drainage\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a hydrocele, which is a fluid-filled sac surrounding the testicle. The fact that the mass is soft, cystic, and transilluminates suggests that it is filled with fluid. The ability to palpate normal tissue above the mass and the lack of bowel sounds or reduction in size when the patient is in a supine position rule out an inguinal hernia. The normal examination of the testis makes testicular cancer or torsion unlikely.\n\nA hydrocele is caused by an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis, a layer of tissue that surrounds the testicle. This can occur due to various reasons, including inflammation, trauma, or tumor. In this case, the patient's family history of seminoma may be a contributing factor, but it is not the direct cause of the hydrocele.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination:\n\nA. Patent processus vaginalis would suggest an inguinal hernia, which is not consistent with the physical examination findings.\n\nB. Dilation of the pampiniform plexus would suggest a varicocele, which is a dilation of the veins in the scrotum, but this is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination.\n\nC. Twisting of the spermatic cord would suggest testicular torsion, which is a surgical emergency that would present with severe pain and a high-riding testicle, neither of which is present in this patient.\n\nE. Impaired lymphatic drainage is not a known cause of a hydrocele.",

She further expresses her concerns about the possibility of contracting tuberculosis as one of the patients under her care is being treated for tuberculosis. A PPD skin test is done and reads 11 mm on day 3. Chest X-ray demonstrates a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe. The standard anti-tuberculosis medication regimen is started. At a follow-up appointment 3 months later the patient presents with fatigue. She has also been experiencing occasional dizziness, weakness, and numbness in her feet. Physical exam is positive for conjunctival pallor. Lab work is significant for a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume of 68 fl. What is the most likely cause of her current symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Decreased methionine synthesis\nB. Inhibition of ferrochelatase\nC. Increased homocysteine degradation\nD. Increased GABA production\nE. Decreased ALA synthesis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Decreased methionine synthesis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, weakness, and numbness in her feet, along with conjunctival pallor and a low hemoglobin level (10 g/dL) and mean corpuscular volume (68 fl), suggest anemia. The most likely cause of this anemia is a deficiency of vitamin B12, which is a common side effect of isoniazid (INH) therapy, one of the medications used to treat tuberculosis.\n\nIsoniazid inhibits the enzyme methionine synthase, which is necessary for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. This leads to a deficiency of vitamin B12, which is required for the production of red blood cells. The resulting anemia is characterized by small, pale red blood cells (microcytic anemia).\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and the side effects of isoniazid therapy:\n\nB. Inhibition of ferrochelatase is related to lead poisoning, not isoniazid therapy.\n\nC. Increased homocysteine degradation is not a known side effect of isoniazid therapy.\n\nD. Increased GABA production is related to the mechanism of action of isoniazid as an antidepressant, but it is not related to the patient's symptoms.\n\nE. Decreased ALA synthesis is related to the metabolism of heme, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and the side effects of isoniazid therapy.",

When she sees her neighbors walking their dogs outside, she is terrified and begins to feel short of breath.

Systematic desensitization.\n\nThe patient is experiencing a specific phobia, in this case, cynophobia (fear of dogs). Systematic desensitization is a type of behavioral therapy that is specifically designed to treat phobias. It involves gradually exposing the patient to the feared object (in this case, dogs) in a controlled and safe environment, while teaching them relaxation techniques to manage their anxiety response. This approach helps the patient to gradually become comfortable with the presence of dogs and eventually overcome their phobia.\n\nWhile SSRIs (A) and benzodiazepines (B) may be used to treat anxiety disorders, they are not the most effective treatment for specific phobias like cynophobia. Cognitive behavioral therapy (D) is a broader type of therapy that can be effective for anxiety disorders, but it may not specifically target the phobia in the same way that systematic desensitization does. Dialectical behavioral therapy (E) is a type of therapy that is typically used to treat borderline personality disorder, and is not typically used to treat specific phobias.",

The patient was found unconscious with a large metal spike protruding from his abdomen by a coworker who was unable to estimate the amount of time the patient went without medical aid. Upon arrival to the ER, the patient was unconscious and unresponsive. His vital signs are BP: 80/40, HR: 120 bpm, RR: 25 bpm, Temperature: 97.1 degrees, and SPO2: 99%.He is taken to the operating room to remove the foreign body and control the bleeding. Although both objectives were accomplished, the patient had an acute drop in his blood pressure during the surgery at which time ST elevations were noted in multiple leads. This resolved with adequate fluid resuscitation and numerous blood transfusions. The patient remained sedated after surgery and continued to have relatively stable vital signs until his third day in the intensive care unit, when he experiences an oxygen desaturation of 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute. On auscultation air entry is present bilaterally with the presence of crackles. A 2/6 systolic murmur is heard. Readings from a Swan-Ganz catheter display the following: central venous pressure (CVP): 4 mmHg, right ventricular pressure (RVP) 20/5 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP): 20/5 mmHg. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP): 5 mm Hg. A chest x-ray is shown as Image A. The patient dies soon after this episode. What is the most likely direct cause of his death?\nOptions:\nA. Diffuse alveolar damage\nB. Ventricular septal defect\nC. Myocardial free wall rupture\nD. Papillary muscle rupture\nE. Myocardial reinfarction\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Diffuse alveolar damage.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and test results suggest acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by diffuse alveolar damage. The patient experienced oxygen desaturation despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen, and auscultation revealed crackles bilaterally, indicating lung injury. The chest x-ray (Image A) likely shows bilateral infiltrates or opacities, consistent with ARDS. The Swan-Ganz catheter readings show a low CVP and PCWP, indicating hypovolemia, and elevated RVP and PAP, indicating pulmonary hypertension, which is consistent with ARDS.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and test results:\n\nB. Ventricular septal defect is a congenital heart defect that would not cause the patient's acute respiratory distress.\n\nC. Myocardial free wall rupture is a complication of myocardial infarction, but the patient's ECG showed ST elevations that resolved with fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions, and there is no evidence of cardiac tamponade.\n\nD. Papillary muscle rupture is a complication of myocardial infarction, but there is no evidence of mitral regurgitation or cardiac failure.\n\nE. Myocardial reinfarction is possible, but the patient's symptoms and test results suggest a pulmonary rather than cardiac cause of death.",

He reports having shortness of breath over the last 6 months, but he has felt worse since he contracted a cold that has been traveling around his office. Today, he reports body aches, headache, and fever along with this chronic cough. His past medical history is significant for prediabetes, which he controls with exercise and diet. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history. His blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse rate is 90/min, temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.5\u00b0F), and respiratory rate is 18/min. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilateral, a barrel-shaped chest, and measured breathing through pursed lips. A chest X-ray reveals a flattened diaphragm and no signs of consolidation. Pulmonary function testing reveals FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%. Arterial blood gases (ABG) of this patient are most likely to reveal which of the following?\nOptions:\nA. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis\nB. Primary respiratory acidosis\nC. Primary respiratory alkalosis\nD. Compensatory respiratory acidosis\nE. Anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Primary respiratory acidosis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The chest X-ray and pulmonary function testing (PFT) results support this diagnosis. The FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% indicates airflow obstruction, which is a hallmark of COPD.\n\nGiven the patient's respiratory symptoms and PFT results, it is likely that the arterial blood gases (ABG) will reveal a primary respiratory acidosis. This means that the patient's pH will be low (acidotic) due to an increase in PaCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide). This is because the patient's lungs are not able to effectively expel CO2, leading to a buildup of this gas in the blood.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis would be characterized by a low pH and a normal anion gap, which is not consistent with the patient's respiratory symptoms and PFT results.\n\nC. Primary respiratory alkalosis would be characterized by a high pH and a low PaCO2, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and PFT results.\n\nD. Compensatory respiratory acidosis would imply that the patient's body is compensating for a metabolic alkalosis by increasing ventilation and blowing off CO2, which is not the case here.\n\nE. Anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis is not a likely combination given the patient's symptoms and PFT results.",

The mother is normal, so she is homozygous for the normal gene (XX). All three daughters are unaffected, which means they inherited the normal X chromosome from their mother.\n\nThe probability that each daughter is a carrier (Xh) is 2/3 or approximately 66.67%, since they have a 2/3 chance of inheriting the mutated X chromosome from their father and a 1/3 chance of inheriting the normal X chromosome from their mother.\n\nSo, the probability that the second daughter is a carrier of the disease is approximately 66.67%, which is closest to option C. 50%.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 76-year-old man is brought to his physician's office by his wife due to progressively worsening hearing loss. The patient reports that he noticed a decrease in his hearing approximately 10 years ago. His wife says that he watches television at an elevated volume and appears to have trouble understanding what is being said to him, especially when there is background noise. He states that he also experiences constant ear ringing and episodes of unsteadiness. On physical examination, the outer ears are normal and otoscopic findings are unremarkable. The patient is unable to repeat the sentence said to him on whisper testing. When a vibrating tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, it is heard equally on both ears. When the vibrating tuning fork is placed by the ear and then on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Which of the following structures is most likely impaired in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Tympanic membrane\nB. Malleus\nC. Incus\nD. Stapes\nE. Cochlea\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Cochlea.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest sensorineural hearing loss, which is a type of hearing loss that occurs due to damage to the inner ear or the auditory nerve. The cochlea is the structure responsible for converting sound vibrations into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain, and damage to the cochlea can cause sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as progressive hearing loss, difficulty understanding speech in noisy environments, and constant ear ringing (tinnitus), are all consistent with cochlear damage. The physical examination findings, including the inability to repeat a sentence on whisper testing and the results of the tuning fork test, also support a diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nThe other options are not likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms. The tympanic membrane (A) and the ossicles (B and C) are involved in conductive hearing loss, which is a different type of hearing loss that occurs due to problems with the middle ear. The stapes (D) is one of the ossicles, and damage to the stapes would also cause conductive hearing loss.",

She is concerned about the results of a dipstick test she performed at home, which showed 1+ glucose. She does not know  if her liquid consumption has increased, but she urinates more frequently than before. The course of her pregnancy has been unremarkable and she has no significant co-morbidities. The BMI is 25.6 kg/cm2 and she has gained 3 kg (6.72 lb) during the pregnancy. The blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, the heart rate is 82/min, the respiratory rate is 14/min, and the temperature is 36.6\u2103 (97.9\u2109). The lungs are clear to auscultation, the heart sounds are normal with no murmurs, and there is no abdominal or costovertebral angle tenderness. The laboratory tests show the following results:\nFasting glucose 97 mg/L\nALT 12 IU/L\nAST 14 IU/L\nTotal bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL(15 \u00b5mol/L)\nPlasma creatinine 0.7 mg/dL (61.9 \u00b5mol/L)\nWhich of the following tests are indicated to determine the cause of the abnormal dipstick test results?\nOptions:\nA.

Urinalysis.\n\nThe patient's concern is about the 1+ glucose result on a home dipstick test, which suggests possible glucosuria (glucose in the urine). To determine the cause of this result, a urinalysis is indicated to assess for other signs of urinary tract infection, kidney damage, or other conditions that may be contributing to the glucosuria. The patient's fasting glucose level is within normal limits, and there is no indication for an oral glucose tolerance test or HbA1c measurement at this time. A random plasma glucose test may not provide additional information in this scenario. Since the patient is asymptomatic and has no other abnormal findings, no further tests are required beyond a urinalysis to evaluate the glucosuria.",

Transforming growth factor beta\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Adenosine.\n\nDuring exertion, the heart requires more oxygen to meet the increased demand. To increase coronary blood flow, adenosine is released locally as a vasodilator. Adenosine binds to A2A receptors on coronary artery smooth muscle cells, causing relaxation and dilation of the vessels, which increases blood flow to the heart.

Nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis\nD. Toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis\nE. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis.\n\nThe patient's history of taking over-the-counter pain medications for an extended period, along with the presence of eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation on renal biopsy, suggests a diagnosis of toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis. This is a type of kidney damage caused by a reaction to a medication, in this case, likely the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used to treat the patient's osteoarthritis. The patient's deteriorating renal function, as evidenced by the increased serum creatinine and proteinuria, is consistent with this diagnosis.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 32-year-old man arrives to his primary care physician to discuss his fear of flying. The patient reports that he has had a fear of flying since being a teenager. He went on a family vacation 15 years ago, and during the flight there was turbulence and a \u201crough landing\u201d. Since then he has avoided flying. He did not go to his cousin\u2019s wedding because it was out of the country. He also was unable to visit his grandmother for her 80th birthday. The last time his job asked him to meet a client out of state, he drove 18 hours instead of flying. Two years ago he promised his fianc\u00e9 they could fly to Florida. Upon arrival at the airport, he began to feel dizzy, lightheaded, and refused to go through security. During the clinic visit, the patient appears anxious and distressed. He recognizes that his fear is irrational. He is upset that it is affecting his relationship with his wife. Additionally, his current job may soon require employees in his sales position to fly to meet potential clients. He is embarrassed to have a conversation with his manager about his fear of flying. Which of the following is the best therapy for the patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. Alprazolam\nB. Cognitive behavioral therapy\nC. Fluoxetine\nD. Psychodynamic psychotherapy\nE. Zolpidem\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with a specific phobia, specifically aviophobia (fear of flying). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a highly effective treatment for specific phobias, including aviophobia. CBT helps the patient identify and challenge negative thoughts and behaviors associated with the phobia, and learn coping skills to manage anxiety in the presence of the feared stimulus (in this case, flying).\n\nAlprazolam (A) is a benzodiazepine that may provide short-term relief from anxiety, but it is not a long-term solution and can be habit-forming. Fluoxetine (C) is an antidepressant that may be used to treat anxiety disorders, but it is not specifically indicated for phobias. Psychodynamic psychotherapy (D) may help the patient understand the underlying causes of their phobia, but it is not as effective as CBT in reducing symptoms. Zolpidem (E) is a sedative-hypnotic that is not indicated for the treatment of phobias or anxiety disorders.",

A skin biopsy is performed, which shows an epidermal basement membrane with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and linear immunofluorescence. Which of the following is the most likely cell junction to which the antibodies bind?\nOptions:\nA. Adherens junctions\nB. Desmosomes\nC. Gap junctions\nD. Hemidesmosomes\nE. Tight junctions\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Hemidesmosomes.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and the skin biopsy results are consistent with bullous pemphigoid, an autoimmune skin disease characterized by the formation of bullae (blisters) on the skin. The linear immunofluorescence pattern on the skin biopsy suggests that the antibodies are binding to the epidermal basement membrane zone.\n\nIn bullous pemphigoid, the autoantibodies bind to the hemidesmosomes, which are specialized cell junctions that anchor the epidermis to the dermis. Specifically, the antibodies target the BP180 and BP230 proteins, which are components of the hemidesmosomes. This binding leads to the separation of the epidermis from the dermis, resulting in the formation of bullae.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Adherens junctions are involved in cell-cell adhesion, but they are not typically involved in bullous pemphigoid.\n\nB. Desmosomes are also involved in cell-cell adhesion, but they are not the primary target of autoantibodies in bullous pemphigoid.\n\nC.

She does not have friends and spends most of the time reading by herself. Her father says that she comes up with excuses to avoid family dinners and other social events. She states that she likes reading and feels more comfortable on her own. On mental status examination, her thought process is organized and logical. Her affect is flat. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Schizoid personality disorder\nB. Schizotypal personality disorder\nC. Antisocial personality disorder\nD. Schizophreniform disorder\nE. Autism spectrum disorder\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Schizoid personality disorder.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as preferring to be alone, avoiding social interactions, and having a flat affect, are consistent with schizoid personality disorder. People with schizoid personality disorder often have difficulty forming and maintaining relationships, and may prefer to spend time alone, engaging in solitary activities such as reading. They may also have a restricted range of emotions, which can manifest as a flat affect.\n\nSchizotypal personality disorder (option B) is also a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's organized and logical thought process. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by disorganized thinking, odd beliefs, and eccentric behavior, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.\n\nAntisocial personality disorder (option C) is not a good fit, as it is characterized by a disregard for others' rights and a lack of empathy, which are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.\n\nSchizophreniform disorder (option D) is a psychotic disorder that is characterized by a brief episode of psychosis, which is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.\n\nAutism spectrum disorder (option E) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behaviors. While the patient's avoidance of social interactions and preference for solitary activities may be similar to those seen in autism spectrum disorder, the patient's organized and logical thought process and lack of repetitive behaviors make this diagnosis less likely.",

His temperature is 38.7\u00b0C (101.7\u00b0F), pulse is 109/min, respirations are 27/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. There are decreased breath sounds and crackles heard over the upper right lung field. His hemoglobin concentration is 13.3 g/dL, leukocyte count is 15,000/mm3, and platelet count is 289,000/mm3.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae\nC. Staphylococcus aureus\nD. Chlamydophila pneumoniae\nE. Haemophilus influenzae\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Mycoplasma pneumoniae.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as a high-grade fever, cough, and shortness of breath, are consistent with pneumonia. The fact that the patient's symptoms initially improved but then worsened again over the past 5 days suggests a possible atypical pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of atypical pneumonia in adolescents and young adults, and it is known to cause a prolonged illness with a biphasic course, which fits with the patient's history.\n\nThe chest x-ray showing a right upper-lobe infiltrate also supports this diagnosis. While Streptococcus pneumoniae (option A) can cause pneumonia, it is more likely to cause a lobar pneumonia with a more sudden onset, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with an atypical pneumonia. Staphylococcus aureus (option C) is a possible cause of pneumonia, but it is less likely in this case given the patient's age and the lack of other symptoms suggestive of a staphylococcal infection. Chlamydophila pneumoniae (option D) is another possible cause of atypical pneumonia, but it is less common than Mycoplasma pneumoniae in this age group. Haemophilus influenzae (option E) is a possible cause of pneumonia, but it is more likely to cause a lobar pneumonia with a more sudden onset, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with an atypical pneumonia.",

Reduction in myocardial contractility.\n\nThe graph shows a decrease in the left ventricular pressure and an increase in the left ventricular volume, indicating a decrease in myocardial contractility. This is consistent with the mechanism of action of medications such as beta blockers, which reduce the contractility of the heart and decrease the workload on the heart.

Order an ACTH stimulation test.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, constipation, and weight loss, are consistent with adrenal insufficiency. The bronze discoloration of the skin, also known as hyperpigmentation, is a classic sign of Addison's disease, a type of primary adrenal insufficiency. The next step in management would be to confirm the diagnosis with an ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) stimulation test, which measures the response of the adrenal glands to ACTH. This test will help determine if the patient has primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) or secondary adrenal insufficiency (due to pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction).\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA.

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 53-year-old man presents to his physician\u2019s office with a persistent cough which he has had over the last few months. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the previous year and since then has been on a short-acting \u03b2-agonist to help alleviate his symptoms. Since his diagnosis, he has quit smoking, a habit which he had developed about 30 years ago. He used to smoke about 2 packs of cigarettes daily. Today, he has come in with an increase in his symptoms. He tells his physician that he has been having a fever for the past 3 days, ranging between 37.8\u00b0\u201339\u00b0C (100\u00b0F\u2013102.2\u00b0F). Along with this, he has a persistent cough with copious amounts of greenish-yellow sputum. He has also been having difficulty breathing. On examination, his temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F), the respirations are 22/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 115/min. Slight crackles and respiratory wheezes are prominent in the lower lung fields. His FEV1 is 57% of his normal predicted value. He is started on oxygen and a dose of oral prednisone. At this time, which of the following should also be considered as a treatment option?\nOptions:\nA. Doxycycline\nB. Ciprofloxacin\nC. Erythromycin\nD. Piperacillin\nE. Antibiotics would not be appropriate at this time\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Ciprofloxacin.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including a fever, cough with greenish-yellow sputum, and difficulty breathing, suggest an exacerbation of COPD, likely due to a bacterial infection. The patient's history of COPD, smoking, and recent increase in symptoms support this diagnosis.\n\nCiprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is commonly used to treat bacterial exacerbations of COPD. It has good coverage against common pathogens that cause COPD exacerbations, such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nDoxycycline (Option A) is a tetracycline antibiotic that may also be used to treat COPD exacerbations, but it is not as commonly used as ciprofloxacin.\n\nErythromycin (Option C) is a macrolide antibiotic that is not typically used to treat COPD exacerbations.\n\nPiperacillin (Option D) is a penicillin antibiotic that is often used to treat more severe infections, such as pneumonia, but it may not be the best choice for this patient's symptoms.\n\nOption E, \"Antibiotics would not be appropriate at this time,\" is incorrect because the patient's symptoms suggest a bacterial infection, and antibiotics are a common treatment for COPD exacerbations.",

Laboratory studies show:\nSerum\nNa+ 130 mEq/L\nK+ 4.0 mEq/L\nCl- 103 mEq/L\nHCO3- 24 mEq/L\nUrea nitrogen 14 mg/dL\nCreatinine 1.1 mg/dL\nOsmolality 270 mOsmol/kg H2O\nUrine\nSodium 45 mEq/L\nOsmolality 326 mOsmol/kg H2O\nA CT scan of the head shows an unchanged right-sided subdural hematoma. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\"\nOptions:\nA. Head elevation\nB. Tolvaptan\nC. Desmopressin\nD. Fluid restriction\nE. Mannitol\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Fluid restriction.\n\nThe patient's laboratory results indicate hyponatremia (Na+ 130 mEq/L), which is likely due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. This is supported by the low serum sodium, high urine osmolality, and high urine sodium levels. SIADH is a common complication of head trauma, and it can lead to hyponatremia.\n\nThe most appropriate next step in management is fluid restriction (option D) to help correct the hyponatremia. Fluid restriction will help reduce the amount of free water in the body, which will help increase the serum sodium levels.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. Head elevation may help reduce intracranial pressure, but it will not address the hyponatremia.\n\nB. Tolvaptan is a vasopressin receptor antagonist that can be used to treat hyponatremia, but it is not the first-line treatment.\n\nC. Desmopressin is a vasopressin analogue that can exacerbate hyponatremia and is not indicated in this case.\n\nE. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that can be used to reduce intracranial pressure, but it is not indicated for the treatment of hyponatremia.",

She has never had a period and is anxious that she is not \u201ckeeping up\u201d with her friends. She states that her breasts began developing when she was 13, and she had a growth spurt around the same time. Review of systems reveals that she has also been getting headaches every few months over the last year with some photosensitivity and nausea each time. Ibuprofen relieves her symptoms. The patient is a competitive ice skater and has never been sexually active. Her mother has a history of migraine headaches, and her older sister has a history of bipolar disorder. Both underwent menarche at age 15. At this visit, the patient\u2019s temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 118/65 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Her body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Both breasts are Tanner IV with no expressable discharge. Pelvic and axillary hair growth is also Tanner IV. The patient is unable to tolerate a full pelvic exam, but the part of the vaginal canal that is examined is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are ordered and are below:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nK+: 4.1 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 24 mEq/L\nUrea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL\nGlucose: 73 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 0.9 mg/dL\nCa2+: 9.7 mg/dL\nMg2+: 1.7 mEq/L\nAST: 11 U/L\nALT: 11 U/L\nFollicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH): 16.2 mIU/mL (4.7-21.5 mIU/ml)\nEstrogen: 240 pg/mL (64-357 pg/mL)\n\nAbdominal ultrasound is performed and shows a normal uterus and ovaries.

Normal development\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Normal development.\n\nThe patient's physical examination and laboratory results are consistent with normal pubertal development. She has Tanner IV breast and pubic hair development, indicating that she is in the late stages of puberty. Her estrogen levels are within the normal range, and her FSH levels are slightly elevated but still within the normal range. The abdominal ultrasound shows a normal uterus and ovaries.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of headaches, photosensitivity, and nausea are likely related to migraines, which are common in adolescents and have a family history in this case.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest hypothalamic amenorrhea (A), which would be characterized by low FSH and estrogen levels. Hyperprolactinemia (B) would cause galactorrhea (spontaneous milk production) and low estrogen levels, which are not present in this patient. Imperforate hymen (C) and vaginal septum (D) would cause primary amenorrhea with a normal uterus and ovaries, but the patient's pelvic exam and ultrasound do not suggest any anatomical abnormalities.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with sudden onset of slurred speech. The patient\u2019s eldest daughter says that he couldn\u2019t move his arm during the episode. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and a hemorrhagic stroke 6 years ago, which was treated surgically. After admission, the patient gets increasingly worse and loses consciousness. A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain. The patient\u2019s daughter is asked to consent to a non-emergent, life-saving operation since the patient is in a comatose state. She does not consent to the operation even though the physician stresses it would be life-saving. Upon further discussion, the physician finds out that the patient was abusive and neglectful to his children, and the daughter wants \u201cto live in peace.\u201d The patient has no written advanced directive. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?\nOptions:\nA. Follow the daughter\u2019s wishes to withhold the operation\nB. Refer this case to the court\nC. Contact another family member for consent\nD. Perform the surgery without consent\nE. Report the daughter to the police\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Follow the daughter's wishes to withhold the operation.\n\nIn this scenario, the patient is in a comatose state and has no written advanced directive. The daughter, as the next of kin, has the authority to make medical decisions on behalf of the patient. Although the physician believes the operation is life-saving, the daughter has the right to refuse consent based on her own reasons, even if they may seem unconventional or motivated by personal feelings.\n\nThe other options are not appropriate:\n\nB. Referring the case to the court would be unnecessary and may delay the decision-making process.\n\nC. Contacting another family member for consent may not be feasible or appropriate, especially if the daughter is the primary caregiver or has a close relationship with the patient.\n\nD. Performing the surgery without consent would be unethical and violate the patient's autonomy.\n\nE. Reporting the daughter to the police is not relevant to the medical decision-making process and would not be an appropriate response.",

The nurse who evaluated her tried to stand her up, but when the patient tried to stand on her right leg, she dropped her left hip and lost her balance. The nurse then recognized that her patient had a foreshortened right leg fixed in the adducted position and a large swelling in her right buttock. At the receiving hospital, the patient was confused and, though she knew her name, she couldn\u2019t remember the date and insists to leave the hospital immediately to see her family.

Liquefication of the vitreous body\nD. Increased ciliary muscle tone\nE. Increased lens elasticity\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Decreased susceptibility to glare.\n\nThe patient's improved vision is likely due to a decrease in the progression of cataracts, which is a common complication of diabetes. The hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic medication, may have contributed to the improvement in vision by reducing the glucose levels in the lens, thereby decreasing the formation of sorbitol, a sugar that can contribute to cataract formation. As a result, the patient's vision has improved, and he no longer needs glasses while driving.",

She does not recall trauma to the arm. She also complains of diarrhea and nausea. She is sexually active with one male partner and admits to having pain during intercourse. There is vague and diffuse tenderness to palpation in all four abdominal quadrants. No erythema or edema is noted on the right arm. The fecal occult test is negative. Past records show that this patient has been in the ER 7 times in the past year with similar symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Ulcerative colitis\nB. Illness anxiety disorder\nC. Somatization disorder\nD. Somatoform pain disorder\nE. Conversion disorder\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Somatization disorder.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including right arm pain, limited range of motion, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal tenderness, are vague and diffuse, and there is no clear underlying medical cause. The fact that she has presented to the ER 7 times in the past year with similar symptoms suggests a pattern of excessive and repeated seeking of medical care for unexplained symptoms. This is consistent with somatization disorder, which is a psychiatric condition characterized by the presence of multiple, recurring, and unexplained physical symptoms that are not intentionally produced or feigned.\n\nSomatization disorder is distinct from somatoform pain disorder (option D), which is characterized by pain as the primary symptom. Conversion disorder (option E) involves the sudden onset of neurological symptoms, such as paralysis or blindness, in response to psychological stress. Illness anxiety disorder (option B) involves excessive worry about having or acquiring a serious illness, but the patient's symptoms are not necessarily unexplained. Ulcerative colitis (option A) is a gastrointestinal condition that would likely have more specific and objective findings on examination and diagnostic testing.",

He is accompanied by his mother who reports that the patient recently experienced a 5-day episode of minimal sleep and unusual levels of energy. The patient admits to spending $2,000 of his parent\u2019s money, without asking, on a down payment for a motorcycle. The episode resolved after 5 days, at which point the patient felt guilty and upset. The patient\u2019s medical history is notable for multiple month-long episodes in the past 2 years of feeling sad, sleeping more than usual, being uninterested in his hobbies, and feeling constantly tired and guilty. The patient has a history of severe meningoencephalitis at the age of 17 requiring four days in the intensive care unit. During that episode, he reported seeing monkeys in his hospital room. On exam, he is a well-appearing, cooperative male in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented with a normal affect. He states that he feels sad and guilty about what happens. He denies suicidal ideation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Bipolar I disorder\nB. Bipolar II disorder\nC. Cyclothymic disorder\nD. Persistent depressive disorder\nE. Schizoaffective disorder\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Cyclothymic disorder.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The patient has a history of mood fluctuations, with episodes of elevated mood (5-day episode of minimal sleep and unusual levels of energy) and depressive episodes (multiple month-long episodes of feeling sad, sleeping more than usual, being uninterested in his hobbies, and feeling constantly tired and guilty).\n* The patient's symptoms do not meet the criteria for a full-blown manic episode (which would require a 7-day duration or hospitalization), but rather a hypomanic episode (which can last for at least 4 days).\n* The patient's history of severe meningoencephalitis at the age of 17, which included psychotic symptoms (seeing monkeys in his hospital room), suggests that he may have a underlying vulnerability to mood instability.\n* Cyclothymic disorder is a chronic mood disorder characterized by frequent episodes of hypomania and depression that do not meet the full criteria for a major depressive episode or a manic episode.\n\nBipolar I disorder (A) is unlikely because the patient's elevated mood episode was not severe enough to require hospitalization or last for at least 7 days. Bipolar II disorder (B) is also unlikely because the patient's depressive episodes are not severe enough to meet the criteria for a major depressive episode. Persistent depressive disorder (D) is not a good fit because the patient has a history of elevated mood episodes. Schizoaffective disorder (E) is unlikely because the patient's psychotic symptoms were likely a result of his meningoencephalitis rather than a primary psychotic disorder.",

He has been confined to bed for the past 5 days and is under observation. He felt a sudden difficulty in breathing and called for the ward nurse. He says that he is unable to take deep breaths and has a sharp pain on the right side of his chest with each inspiration.

Lower extremity doppler\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. CT scan.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as sudden difficulty breathing, sharp chest pain on inspiration, and tachycardia, are consistent with a pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is at high risk for PE due to his recent knee replacement surgery and prolonged bed rest. The physical examination finding of pain in the right calf on dorsiflexion (Homan's sign) also suggests deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can lead to PE.\n\nA CT scan with contrast is the best course of management at this time because it is the most sensitive and specific test for diagnosing PE. It can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further treatment.\n\nOption A, subcutaneous fondaparinux, is an anticoagulant that may be used for prophylaxis or treatment of DVT and PE, but it is not a diagnostic test.\n\nOption C, inferior vena cava filter, is a treatment option for patients with PE who cannot receive anticoagulation therapy, but it is not a diagnostic test.\n\nOption D, ventilation-perfusion scan, is a diagnostic test for PE, but it is less sensitive and specific than a CT scan, especially in patients with underlying lung disease.\n\nOption E, lower extremity doppler, is a diagnostic test for DVT, but it does not diagnose PE.",

Approximately 6 months ago, she started noticing that he was walking more slowly than usual. He has fallen more than 6 times in the past month, and she is worried that he will sustain a serious injury if he does not stop falling. The patient is a retired banking executive and was active as a triathlete until the age of 60. He does not smoke and drinks 2-3 alcoholic beverages per day. His family history is notable for normal pressure hydrocephalus in his mother and Alzheimer dementia in his father. His temperature is 97.8\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 131/81 mmHg, pulse is 68/min, and respirations are 19/min. On exam, his movements appear slowed and forced.

Dilation of the pampiniform plexus.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including swelling and pain in the right testicle, along with a history of fever and swelling on the right side of his face, suggest a diagnosis of mumps orchitis. Mumps is a viral infection that can cause inflammation of the testicles, leading to orchitis. The pampiniform plexus is a network of veins in the spermatic cord that can become dilated in cases of orchitis, leading to testicular swelling and pain.\n\nThe other options are not characteristic of mumps orchitis:\n\nA. Mumps is not preventable by a live attenuated vaccine (although there is an MMR vaccine that protects against measles, mumps, and rubella).\n\nC. Mumps does not typically present with a painless chancre (a characteristic of syphilis).\n\nD. Mumps does not typically cause buboes in the inguinal lymph nodes (a characteristic of lymphogranuloma venereum).\n\nE. Mumps is not a common cause of septic arthritis in this patient's age group.",

The patient reports severe pelvic pain. Pregnancy has been complicated by gestational diabetes. Pregnancy and delivery of her first child were uncomplicated. Current medications include insulin, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Vital signs are within normal limits. The cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. Epidural anesthesia is performed and the patient's symptoms improve. Ten minutes later, the patient has dizziness. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's hypotension?\nOptions:\nA. Decreased cardiac contractility\nB. Sympathetic block\nC. Hypovolemia\nD. Acute pulmonary hypertension\nE. Aortocaval compression\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Sympathetic block.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of dizziness, bradycardia (pulse of 68/min), and hypotension (blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg) after receiving epidural anesthesia are consistent with a sympathetic block. This is a common side effect of epidural anesthesia, particularly in pregnant women. The sympathetic block causes vasodilation, which leads to a decrease in blood pressure. The patient's symptoms improved with intravenous fluid resuscitation, which supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe other options are not as likely:\n\nA. Decreased cardiac contractility is not a common side effect of epidural anesthesia.\n\nC. Hypovolemia is possible, but the patient's symptoms improved with fluid resuscitation, making sympathetic block a more likely cause.\n\nD. Acute pulmonary hypertension is not a common complication of epidural anesthesia.\n\nE. Aortocaval compression is a possible cause of hypotension in pregnant women, but it is more likely to occur in the supine position, and the patient's symptoms improved with fluid resuscitation, making sympathetic block a more likely cause.",

He was diagnosed with heart failure 1 year ago. During his last visit to his primary care physician, he was doing well and the lab results were normal. He reports that he has been taking low-dose aspirin and digoxin regularly for 1 year, and verapamil was recently added to prevent his frequent migraine headaches. An electrocardiogram is performed urgently and shows paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block. Suspecting digitalis toxicity, the emergency medicine physician sends blood to the lab for a serum digoxin level, which is 3.7 ng/mL (therapeutic range: 0.8\u20132 ng/mL). Which of the following mechanisms most likely explains the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Drug-induced hypokalemia\nB. Increased intestinal absorption of digoxin\nC. Inhibition of CYP 3A4 isoenzyme\nD. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein\nE. Increased enterohepatic circulation of digoxin\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein.\n\nThe patient was recently started on verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, to prevent migraine headaches. Verapamil is a known inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, a transport protein that helps to eliminate digoxin from the body. By inhibiting P-glycoprotein, verapamil increased the absorption and reduced the elimination of digoxin, leading to elevated serum levels and digitalis toxicity.",

The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, heart rate 81/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F). Her examination is significant for acrocyanosis and a fixed splitting of S2 and grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border. Which of the following physiological pregnancy changes is causing the change in this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. Increase in pulmonary vascular resistance\nB. Increase in heart rate\nC. Decrease in systemic vascular resistance\nD. Increase in cardiac output\nE. Increase in blood volume\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Increase in cardiac output.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of dizziness and dyspnea on exertion, which have worsened during pregnancy, are likely due to the increased cardiac output that occurs during pregnancy. The increased cardiac output can exacerbate the patient's underlying cardiac condition, which is likely an atrial septal defect (ASD) given the fixed splitting of S2 and the midsystolic murmur heard over the left upper sternal border. The increased cardiac output can cause more blood to flow through the defect, leading to increased right-to-left shunting and worsening cyanosis and symptoms.",

She and her husband recently bought a new house in the area. While cleaning the house, they discovered a nest of spiders. She reports blacking out and waking up outside the house with a bandage on her arm. Her husband says that she began screaming and ran out of the house, breaking a window, and cutting her arm. The patient says she has tried to enter the house several times over the last several months but can not bring herself to cross the threshold for fear of more spiders. She wants to overcome her extreme and irrational fear. Which of the following is the most effective treatment to overcome this patient\u2019s arachnophobia?\nOptions:\nA. Desensitization\nB. Paroxetine\nC. Metoprolol\nD. Alprazolam\nE. Psychotherapy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Desensitization.\n\nDesensitization is a type of exposure therapy that is commonly used to treat specific phobias, such as arachnophobia. The goal of desensitization is to help the patient gradually become comfortable with the feared object or situation (in this case, spiders) by gradually exposing them to it in a controlled and safe environment. This can be done through imaginal exposure (imagining the feared situation), in vivo exposure (actual exposure to the feared situation), or a combination of both.\n\nWhile medications such as paroxetine (B) and alprazolam (D) may be used to treat anxiety disorders, they are not the most effective treatment for specific phobias like arachnophobia. Metoprolol (C) is a beta blocker that is sometimes used to treat performance anxiety, but it is not typically used to treat phobias. Psychotherapy (E) is a broad term that encompasses many different types of therapy, including desensitization, but it is not a specific treatment approach.\n\nDesensitization has been shown to be a highly effective treatment for specific phobias, with success rates of 70-90% or higher in some studies. It is often preferred over medication because it can produce long-term changes in behavior and cognition, and it does not have the potential side effects associated with medication.",

He reports that these symptoms seem to worsen with each fall. Initially, he could not remember directions to his home but now cannot remember recent conversations or appointments he has made. He often repeats questions that he asked shortly before. He has long-standing hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include aspirin, carvedilol, enalapril, and atorvastatin. Examination shows a bruise over the left temple and an unsteady gait. On mental status examination, he is oriented to place and person only. Short-term memory is impaired; he can recall 0 out of 5 objects after 10 minutes. Long-term memory is intact. He has no delusions or hallucinations. Muscle strength is decreased in the left lower extremity. The Babinski sign is present on the left. A CT scan of the head is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Warfarin therapy\nB. Vitamin E therapy\nC. Cerebral shunting\nD. Tetrabenazine therapy\nE. Cognitive training\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Cerebral shunting.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and CT scan suggest normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a condition characterized by the gradual accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to cognitive decline, gait disturbances, and incontinence. The CT scan likely shows enlarged ventricles, which is a hallmark of NPH.\n\nCerebral shunting is a surgical procedure that involves diverting excess cerebrospinal fluid from the brain to another part of the body, such as the abdomen, where it can be absorbed. This can help to alleviate symptoms and improve cognitive function.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the management of NPH:\n\nA. Warfarin therapy is an anticoagulant medication used to prevent stroke and blood clots, but it is not relevant to the patient's symptoms.\n\nB. Vitamin E therapy is sometimes used to slow down cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease, but it is not a treatment for NPH.\n\nD. Tetrabenazine therapy is a medication used to treat chorea, a movement disorder, but it is not relevant to the patient's symptoms.\n\nE. Cognitive training may be helpful for patients with mild cognitive impairment, but it is not a treatment for NPH.",

On exam, her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/84 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 12/min. On further workup, the patient is found to have calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis with hypercalciuria. Blood studies demonstrate increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) and hypercalcemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause?\nOptions:\nA. Primary hyperparathyroidism\nB. Pseudohypoparathyroidism\nC. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism\nD. Secondary hyperparathyroidism\nE. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Primary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of flank pain, radiating to the abdomen and groin, and pink tinge to her urine suggest kidney stones, which is confirmed by the diagnosis of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. The presence of hypercalciuria (excess calcium in the urine) and hypercalcemia (elevated calcium levels in the blood) suggests an underlying disorder of calcium metabolism.\n\nThe increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in the blood suggest that the parathyroid glands are overactive, leading to excessive calcium release from bones and increased calcium absorption from the gut. This is consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, a condition in which one or more of the parathyroid glands become overactive and produce excessive amounts of PTH.\n\nThe other options are not as likely:\n\nB. Pseudohypoparathyroidism is a rare genetic disorder characterized by resistance to PTH, leading to hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) and hyperphosphatemia (high phosphate levels). It does not typically present with hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.\n\nC. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism is a rare genetic disorder that is similar to pseudohypoparathyroidism but without the biochemical abnormalities. It is not typically associated with hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.\n\nD. Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs when another underlying condition, such as kidney disease or vitamin D deficiency, leads to increased PTH production. While the patient has kidney stones, there is no indication of underlying kidney disease or vitamin D deficiency.\n\nE. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is a rare condition that occurs when secondary hyperparathyroidism persists for a long time, leading to autonomous parathyroid gland function. It is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.",

She no longer finds any happiness in activities that she previously enjoyed. She also states that she really struggles to sleep and at times can't sleep for several days. The patient is started on appropriate first-line therapy and sent home. She returns 1 week later stating that her symptoms have not improved.

Change treatment to duloxetine\nC. Change treatment to lithium\nD. Continue current therapy\nE. Electroconvulsive therapy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Continue current therapy.\n\nThe patient has been on treatment for only 1 week, which is a relatively short period of time. It's common for antidepressant medications to take 4-6 weeks to start showing significant improvement in symptoms. Therefore, the best next step would be to continue the current therapy and reassess the patient's symptoms in another 2-3 weeks. Adding lithium or changing to a different medication (duloxetine or lithium) may be premature at this point. Electroconvulsive therapy is typically reserved for more severe or treatment-resistant cases, and is not indicated at this stage.",

Her last period was 6 months ago. Since almost a year and a half ago, she intentionally restricted her diet at the expense of carbohydrates, exercised intensively, and lost 18.0 kg (39.7 lb). She had her menarche at the age of 12 and menstruated normally until last year. She is not sexually active. On physical examination, the vital signs include blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate 55/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature 35.9\u00b0C (96.6\u00b0F). Her weight is 55.0 kg (121.3 lb), and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in). Physical examination reveals the good development of muscles and decreased adiposity. A bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits. Which statement about this patient\u2019s condition is correct?\nOptions:\nA. Hypertrophied muscles are the source of additional androgens which interfere with the patient\u2019s menstrual cycle\nB. This patient has insulin resistance\nC. Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient\nD. The patient is likely to have decreased blood estrogen concentration due to increased liver metabolism\nE. The patient should be checked for hyperthyroidism because such extensive lipolysis is likely to result from thyroid hyperfunction\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest that she has developed amenorrhea (cessation of menstruation) due to excessive weight loss and decreased body fat. The decreased adiposity is likely contributing to hypoestrogenemia (low estrogen levels), which is disrupting her menstrual cycle. This is because adipose tissue is a source of estrogen production, and with decreased body fat, estrogen levels may be reduced.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. Hypertrophied muscles are not a source of androgens that would interfere with the menstrual cycle.\n\nB. Insulin resistance is not directly related to the patient's amenorrhea.\n\nD. Decreased liver metabolism is not a likely cause of decreased estrogen levels in this patient.\n\nE. Hyperthyroidism is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms, and extensive lipolysis is not typically associated with thyroid hyperfunction.",

She has had a lot of stress at work and has been on sick leave for 2 weeks, but states that she would like to return to work. She has had several episodes of lower abdominal pain. She says, \"\"I know I have cancer.\"\" She requests a diagnostic laparoscopy. She was diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease 6 months ago. Her only medication is omeprazole. The patient appears pale. Her temperature is 36.5\u00b0 C (97.7\u00b0 F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg. On mental status examination she is tired and has a depressed mood.

Factitious disorder.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a factitious disorder, also known as Munchausen syndrome. The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease and is taking omeprazole, but the current symptoms are not consistent with a gastrointestinal disorder. The patient's request for a diagnostic laparoscopy and her statement \"I know I have cancer\" suggest a desire for medical attention and treatment.\n\nThe physical examination findings, such as pale conjunctivae, dry mucous membranes, and crusts along the course of her left arm veins, are consistent with self-induced bleeding or injection of substances into the veins. The laboratory results, including a low hemoglobin level, high reticulocyte count, and normal electrolyte levels, support the diagnosis of factitious disorder.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Somatic symptom disorder (option B) is a diagnosis that is made when a patient has excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to their symptoms, but the patient's symptoms are not intentionally produced or feigned. Conversion disorder (option C) is a diagnosis that is made when a patient has a neurological symptom that cannot be explained by a medical condition, but the patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis. Primary hyperparathyroidism (option D) is a diagnosis that is made when a patient has an overactive parathyroid gland, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are not consistent with this diagnosis. Acute small bowel hemorrhage (option E) is a diagnosis that is made when a patient has bleeding in the small intestine, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are not consistent with this diagnosis.",

He was recently fired from his job to which he claims that his boss was jealous of his hard work. He also does not trust his neighbors and thinks they are out to get all the nice things he has. His wife also says that he has begun to doubt her fidelity and believes that even the marriage counselor is on her side. Which of the following psychiatric disorders also belongs to the same cluster of symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Schizotypal personality disorder\nB. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder\nC. Antisocial personality disorder\nD. Narcissistic personality disorder\nE. Personality disorder not otherwise specified\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Narcissistic personality disorder.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as being critical of others, having a sense of entitlement, being quick to take offense, and having a lack of empathy, are all characteristic of narcissistic personality disorder. Additionally, the patient's tendency to blame others (e.g., his boss) and his suspiciousness of others' motives (e.g., his wife's fidelity) are also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nThe other options do not fit as well:\n\nA. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by odd or eccentric behavior, thinking, and speech, which is not described in the patient.\n\nB. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is characterized by perfectionism, rigidity, and a need for control, which is not evident in the patient.\n\nC. Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a disregard for others' rights and a lack of empathy, but the patient's symptoms are more focused on his own sense of entitlement and suspiciousness.\n\nE. Personality disorder not otherwise specified is a catch-all category for personality disorders that do not meet the criteria for a specific disorder, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with narcissistic personality disorder.",

He was found unconscious and covered in bruises outside of a local bar. The patient has a past medical history of polysubstance abuse, depression, multiple suicide attempts, neuropathic pain, and schizophrenia. As part of the patient\u2019s initial workup, a head CT is performed which is unremarkable, and an arterial blood gas is performed as seen below:\n\npH: 7.29\nPaCO2: 95 mm Hg\nPaO2: 70 mm Hg\nBicarbonate: 24 mEq/L\n\nWhich of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s current presentation?\nOptions:\nA. Alcohol\nB. Amitriptyline\nC. Cocaine\nD. Ethylene glycol\nE. Heroin\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Amitriptyline.\n\nThe patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a respiratory acidosis, with a pH of 7.29, a PaCO2 of 95 mm Hg, and a bicarbonate level of 24 mEq/L. This suggests that the patient has a decreased respiratory drive, leading to a buildup of CO2 in the blood.\n\nAmitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is known to cause respiratory depression, particularly in overdose situations. The patient's history of depression and previous suicide attempts make amitriptyline a likely culprit.\n\nAlcohol (A) can also cause respiratory depression, but it would typically cause a metabolic acidosis, not a respiratory acidosis.\n\nCocaine (C) is a stimulant and would not typically cause respiratory depression.\n\nEthylene glycol (D) is a toxic substance that can cause a metabolic acidosis, but it would not typically cause a respiratory acidosis.\n\nHeroin (E) is an opioid that can cause respiratory depression, but it would typically cause a more severe respiratory acidosis than what is seen in this patient's ABG results.\n\nTherefore, based on the patient's history and ABG results, amitriptyline overdose is the most likely etiology of this patient's current presentation.",

The mother reports that they were walking in the park and the patient\u2019s dad was swinging the patient in the air by her arms. The dad reports he then heard a click and the patient immediately began to cry. On examination, the patient is holding her right forearm in a pronated position and her elbow slightly flexed. Pain is localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow. She refuses to use the affected limb. She does allow passive flexion and extension with full range of motion but supination is limited and causes pain. Which of the following is the next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Immobilization\nB. Moderate flexion then hyperpronation\nC. Open reduction\nD. Radiograph\nE. Supination then maximal extension\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Radiograph.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a radial head subluxation, also known as a \"nursemaid's elbow\". This is a common injury in young children, typically occurring when the forearm is pulled or jerked, causing the radial head to slip out of place.\n\nBefore proceeding with any treatment, it is essential to rule out any other potential injuries or fractures, such as a radial head fracture or elbow dislocation. Therefore, the next step in management is to obtain a radiograph (X-ray) of the elbow to confirm the diagnosis and exclude any other injuries.\n\nAfter the radiograph, if the diagnosis of radial head subluxation is confirmed, the treatment would typically involve a reduction maneuver, such as hyperpronation (option B) or supination and maximal extension (option E). Immobilization (option A) may be necessary if the reduction is unsuccessful or if there is an associated fracture. Open reduction (option C) is not typically necessary for a radial head subluxation.",

He was born at 38 weeks gestation via a spontaneous vaginal delivery without any complications. The mother said that the patient appeared \"normal\" until the past few weeks. On physical exam, his extraocular muscle movements are intact, and a symmetric smile is seen. He has symmetric flaccid weakness of both his upper and lower extremities.

Anterior horn cell degeneration.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including weak cry and suck, symmetric flaccid weakness of both upper and lower extremities, and diminished deep tendon reflexes, are consistent with a diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). SMA is a genetic disorder that affects the anterior horn cells, which are the motor neurons responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement.

Methimazole and propranolol therapy.\n\nThe symptoms described, such as irritability, restlessness, frequent bowel movements, and a rapid heart rate, are consistent with neonatal thyrotoxicosis. The presence of a firm midline neck swelling suggests a goiter, which is a common finding in neonatal thyrotoxicosis. The mother's history of Graves' disease and treatment with propylthiouracil during pregnancy increases the risk of neonatal thyrotoxicosis.\n\nMethimazole and propranolol are commonly used to treat neonatal thyrotoxicosis.

Tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including burning with urination, joint pain and swelling, and conjunctival injection, are consistent with reactive arthritis (ReA), a type of arthritis that occurs in response to an infection, often in the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. The patient's history of fever and bloody diarrhea two weeks prior to the onset of joint symptoms suggests that the arthritis is a reaction to a preceding infection.\n\nTenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon is a common finding in reactive arthritis, particularly in the heel and Achilles tendon. This is due to enthesitis, inflammation at the site where tendons or ligaments insert into bone.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to reactive arthritis:\n\nA.

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 28-year-old female comes to the physician\u2019s office with a complaint of episodic chest pain. She describes the pain as squeezing and tightness in her chest. This pain has been happening every few days for 3 months. She says there is no association of the pain with food or exercise. She is able to climb up to her fourth floor apartment daily without issue. Her only past medical history is migraines for which she takes appropriate medication. Here temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. She has no known family history. The patient is not in pain on presentation and EKG in the office is normal. 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely. The mechanism of this patient\u2019s chest pain is most similar to the mechanism behind which of the following?\nOptions:\nA. Raynaud's phenomenon\nB. Myocardial infarction\nC. Aortic dissection\nD. Costochondritis\nE. Dysphagia\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Raynaud's phenomenon.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, particularly the episodic chest pain with transient ST elevations on 24-hour ECG monitoring, are consistent with Prinzmetal's angina, also known as variant angina. This condition is caused by vasospasm of the coronary arteries, leading to temporary reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle. The mechanism of Prinzmetal's angina is similar to that of Raynaud's phenomenon, which is a condition characterized by vasospasm of the arteries in the fingers and toes, typically in response to cold temperatures or stress. Both conditions involve abnormal vasoreactivity and vasospasm, leading to episodic symptoms.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 22-year-old gravida 1 presents to her physician at 15 weeks gestation for a prenatal appointment. She complains of a rash involving her chest, face, and arms, a watery nasal discharge, and mild bilateral knee pain. She has had these symptoms for about 5 days. The symptoms do not seem to bother her too much, but she is concerned for the baby. She had contact with her younger sister, who also had a rash and was diagnosed with rubella infection about 10 days ago at a family gathering. She cannot confirm her vaccination history. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 89/min; respiratory rate, 12/min; and temperature, 37.6\u2103 (99.7\u2109). Examination shows a moderately dense maculopapular lacy rash spread over the patient\u2019s trunk, extremities, and face. No lymph node, liver, or spleen enlargement is noted. The knee joints appear normal.\nSerology performed 1 year ago Current serology\nRubella IgM - negative Rubella IgM - negative\nRubella IgG - 1:128 Rubella IgG - 1:64\nRubella IgG avidity - high Rubella IgG avidity - high\nWhat is the proper next step in the management of this woman?\nOptions:\nA. Reassure and recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum\nB. Recommend pregnancy termination\nC. Arrange a chorionic villus sampling\nD. Recommend additional serologic testing for parvovirus B19\nE. Test for rubella virus PCR\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Reassure and recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with a viral infection, but the serology results indicate that she is immune to rubella. The presence of rubella IgG antibodies with high avidity suggests that she has had a previous infection or vaccination, and the lack of IgM antibodies indicates that she is not currently infected. The decrease in IgG titer from 1:128 to 1:64 is not significant, as it is still within the range of immunity.\n\nGiven that the patient is immune to rubella, there is no risk of transmission to the fetus, and pregnancy termination is not necessary. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is not indicated, as there is no concern about fetal infection. While parvovirus B19 can cause a similar rash, it is not necessary to test for it in this case, as the patient's symptoms are likely due to another viral infection. Rubella virus PCR is also not necessary, as the patient is not infected with rubella.\n\nThe proper next step is to reassure the patient that she is immune to rubella and that her symptoms are likely due to another viral infection. She should be advised to receive vaccination against rubella postpartum to ensure that she remains immune in the future.",

She is sexually active with multiple partners and admits to using barrier protection inconsistently. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. The patient denies any fever, chills, abdominal pain, menorrhagia, or flank pain. She is afebrile and the vital signs are within normal limits. Speculum examination reveals vaginal erythema with a profuse, greenish-yellow, purulent, malodorous discharge. The vaginal pH is 5.5.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient based on her presentation?\nOptions:\nA. Urinary tract infection\nB. Candida vaginitis\nC. Bacterial vaginosis\nD. Trichomonal vaginitis\nE. Chlamydia infection\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Trichomonal vaginitis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of vaginal discharge, pruritus, and painful micturition, along with the physical examination findings of vaginal erythema and a profuse, greenish-yellow, purulent, and malodorous discharge, are consistent with trichomonal vaginitis. The vaginal pH of 5.5 also supports this diagnosis, as Trichomonas vaginalis infections are often associated with an elevated vaginal pH.\n\nWhile the other options are possible causes of vaginal discharge and discomfort, they are less likely based on the patient's presentation:\n\n* A. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is unlikely, as the patient denies fever, chills, and abdominal pain, and the physical examination does not suggest a UTI.\n* B. Candida vaginitis typically presents with a thick, white, cottage-cheese-like discharge, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.\n* C. Bacterial vaginosis often presents with a thin, white or grayish discharge, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.\n* E. Chlamydia infection is a possible cause of vaginal discharge and painful micturition, but it is often asymptomatic, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with trichomonal vaginitis.",

Increased adenylate cyclase activity.\n\nThe nebulized bronchodilator being referred to is likely a beta2-agonist, such as albuterol. Beta2-agonists work by binding to beta2 receptors in the lungs, which activates adenylate cyclase, an enzyme that converts ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP). The increase in cAMP leads to relaxation of airway smooth muscle, resulting in bronchodilation and relief of asthma symptoms.",

He describes himself as being \u201cgenerally healthy\u201d before the cough began. Past medical history includes hypertension. The patient takes clopamide and a multivitamin daily. His parents are both well and living in a senior living facility. He does not smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. During a review of symptoms, the patient described a hiking trip in and around the desert near Phoenix, Arizona, 4 months ago. At the office, his temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.4\u00b0F), heart rate is 102/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 120/82 mm Hg. A focused chest exam reveals mild fremetus and dullness with percussion on the right side. A chest X-ray shows a right-sided consolidation of the lower right lung, and a chest CT shows an irregular opacity measuring 3.8 cm x 3.0 cm in the sub-plural region of the right middle lobe, a small right-sided pleural effusion, and mild right-sided hilar adenopathy. A lung biopsy is performed to rule out cancer and reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores in the surrounding tissues.

Histoplasmosis (A) is a possibility, but it is less common in the desert southwest and the biopsy findings are not as characteristic of this disease. Mycetoma (B) is a fungal infection that typically causes skin and soft tissue lesions, and is not as likely to cause the patient's pulmonary symptoms. Blastomycosis (C) is a fungal infection that can cause pulmonary symptoms, but it is more common in the southeastern United States and the biopsy findings are not as characteristic of this disease.

On physical exam, you note bipedal edema and jugular venous distention (JVD). An EKG and chest radiographs are obtained (Figures A and B). The patient is started on BIPAP and medical therapy and his symptoms improve rapidly. Lab values are as follows.\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 137 mEq/L\nK+: 3.2 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 31 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 120 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.2 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.9 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following is the best explanation of this patient's current presentation?\nOptions:\nA. Furosemide\nB. Hydrochlorothiazide\nC. Renal tubular acidosis type I\nD. Renal tubular acidosis type II\nE. Renal tubular acidosis type IV\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Furosemide.\n\nThe patient's presentation with shortness of breath, cough, and bipedal edema suggests acute pulmonary edema, which is likely caused by diuretic-induced hypokalemia (low potassium levels). The patient's potassium level is 3.2 mEq/L, which is below the normal range.\n\nFurosemide is a loop diuretic that can cause hypokalemia, especially in patients with heart failure or those who are taking other medications that can lower potassium levels. The patient's history of taking lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, and metformin, which can also lower potassium levels, increases the likelihood that furosemide is the culprit.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's presentation and lab values:\n\nB. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that can cause hypokalemia, but it is not as potent as furosemide in causing potassium depletion.\n\nC. Renal tubular acidosis type I (RTA I) is a disorder characterized by a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and alkaline urine. While the patient has hypokalemia, the pH and bicarbonate levels are normal, making RTA I less likely.\n\nD. Renal tubular acidosis type II (RTA II) is a disorder characterized by a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and acidic urine. The patient's urine pH is not provided, but the normal bicarbonate level makes RTA II less likely.\n\nE. Renal tubular acidosis type IV (RTA IV) is a disorder characterized by a hyperkalemic metabolic acidosis, which is the opposite of the patient's presentation.",

Examination shows multiple hematomas on the upper extremities around the peripheral intravenous access sites. There is a healing sternal incision. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows an aortic click. The right calf is tender, erythematous and swollen. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 13.1 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 9,900/mm3\nPlatelet count 48,000/mm3\nProthrombin time 15 seconds\nActivated partial thromboplastin time 40 seconds\nSerum\nUrea nitrogen 19 mg/dL\nCreatinine 1.1 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 33 U/L\nAST 26 U/L\nALT 33 U/L\n\u03b3-Glutamyl transferase 45 U/L (N=5\u201350 U/L)\nWhich of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?\"\nOptions:\nA. Deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors\nB. Phagocytosis of autoantibody-opsonized platelets\nC. Deficiency of von Willebrand factor\nD. Excess circulating thrombin\nE. Autoantibody-mediated platelet activation\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Excess circulating thrombin.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including bluish discolorations around the peripheral intravenous catheters and severe right leg pain, are consistent with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The laboratory results show a low platelet count, which is a hallmark of HIT. The patient's history of receiving prophylactic unfractionated heparin after aortic valve replacement surgery also supports this diagnosis.\n\nHIT is caused by the formation of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4) in response to heparin administration. These antibodies activate platelets, leading to thrombocytopenia and a prothrombotic state. The excess circulating thrombin is a result of the platelet activation and the subsequent formation of thrombin.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:\n\nA. Deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors would not cause thrombocytopenia or the patient's symptoms.\n\nB. Phagocytosis of autoantibody-opsonized platelets is a mechanism of immune thrombocytopenia, but it is not related to heparin administration.\n\nC. Deficiency of von Willebrand factor would not cause thrombocytopenia or the patient's symptoms.\n\nE. Autoantibody-mediated platelet activation is a mechanism of immune thrombocytopenia, but it is not directly related to heparin administration or the patient's symptoms.",

He was diagnosed with a gene defect on chromosome 7, which has caused dysfunction in a transmembrane protein. This defect has resulted in several hospitalizations for various respiratory infections. At the present time, he is struggling with a cough with thick purulent sputum. A sputum sample is sent for culture and the patient is started on vancomycin.The pediatrician tells the patient\u2019s family that there is a collection of mucus in the respiratory tree which increases the patient's chances of future infections. He will have to undergo chest physiotherapy and they should report any signs of infection immediately to a medical professional. Which of the following pathogens will most likely infect this patient in adulthood?\nOptions:\nA. Staphylococcus\nB. Pseudomonas\nC. Burkholderia\nD. Influenza\nE. Candida\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Pseudomonas.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that they have cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder caused by a defect in the CFTR gene on chromosome 7. This defect leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus that clogs the airways and digestive tract, making it difficult to breathe and digest food.\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen that infects the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis, particularly in adulthood. It is a Gram-negative bacterium that thrives in the thick mucus of the CF airways, causing chronic lung infections and exacerbations.\n\nWhile Staphylococcus aureus (option A) can also infect people with cystic fibrosis, it is more commonly associated with skin and soft tissue infections. Burkholderia cepacia (option C) is another pathogen that can infect people with CF, but it is less common than Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Influenza (option D) is a viral infection that can affect anyone, regardless of their underlying health conditions. Candida (option E) is a fungal pathogen that can cause infections in people with compromised immune systems, but it is not typically associated with cystic fibrosis.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: An 8-week-old male presents with his mother to the pediatrician for a well visit. The patient has been breastfed since birth, and usually feeds for 30 minutes every 2-3 hours. The patient\u2019s mother is concerned that her milk production is not keeping up with the patient\u2019s nutritional requirements. She reports that about two weeks ago the patient began regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds. She reports that he seems mildly upset during the episodes of regurgitation but usually settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. The patient\u2019s mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of the regurgitation. She denies any diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. Her older son had a similar problem with vomiting that resolved around 12 months of age. Four weeks ago, the patient\u2019s height and weight were in the 40th and 34th percentiles, respectively. His height and weight are now respectively in the 37th and 36th percentiles. On physical exam, the patient is cooing in his mother\u2019s lap and smiles reciprocally with her. He lifts his head and shoulders off the examination table when placed in the supine position. His abdomen is soft, non-tender and non-distended. Bowel sounds are normoactive.\n\nWhich of the following is the best next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Initiate proton pump inhibitor\nB. Obtain abdominal ultrasound\nC. Reassurance and counseling on positioning\nD. Recommend modification of mother\u2019s diet\nE. Switch to hydrolyzed formula\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Reassurance and counseling on positioning.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with physiologic reflux, which is common in infants. The fact that the patient is growing well, is not distressed, and settles down quickly after regurgitation episodes suggests that the reflux is not causing any significant harm. The mother's attempt to limit the volume of each feed has already reduced the frequency of regurgitation, which further supports the diagnosis of physiologic reflux.\n\nReassurance and counseling on positioning, such as burping the baby during and after feeds, keeping the baby upright after feeds, and avoiding overfeeding, are likely to be effective in managing the symptoms. There is no indication for initiating proton pump inhibitors, obtaining an abdominal ultrasound, modifying the mother's diet, or switching to hydrolyzed formula at this point.",

He does not experience shortness of breath at rest. He also occasionally has a dry cough. He has not had fever, chills, or night sweats. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. He drinks a beer daily and occasionally more on weekends. He does not use illicit drugs. He is 183 cm (6 ft 0 in) tall and weighs 66 kg (145 lbs); BMI is 19.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 136/88 mm Hg.

Bronchial asthma\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, physical examination, and spirometry results are consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing on lung auscultation suggest airflow obstruction, which is supported by the spirometry results showing an FEV1:FVC ratio of 62% and an FEV1 of 60% of predicted. The decreased DLCO also suggests emphysema, which is a common component of COPD. The patient's 40-year history of smoking is a strong risk factor for COPD.\n\nWhile the other options are possible, they are less likely based on the patient's symptoms and test results. Interstitial lung disease (A) would typically present with a restrictive pattern on spirometry, rather than an obstructive pattern. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (B) is often associated with exposure to specific antigens and would typically present with a more acute onset of symptoms. Bronchiectasis (D) would typically present with a history of recurrent respiratory infections and may have a more prominent cough.

Transferring the newborn to the NICU (B) and starting IV fluids (C) will likely be necessary, but they should be done after the intestines are protected. Placing the newborn under a warmer (D) may be necessary to maintain a stable body temperature, but it is not the most critical step at this time. Immediate surgery (E) may be necessary, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management.",

His mother brings him into your office because she feels she has had to increase the patient\u2019s use of his inhaler to four times per week for the past month. She also reports that he has woken up three times during the night from his symptoms this month. The boy reports that he is upset because he can\u2019t always keep up with his friends in the playground. His past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis. The patient\u2019s temperature is 98\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% O2 on room air. Auscultation of his lungs reveals bilateral late expiratory wheezes.\n\nWhat changes should be made to his current asthma treatment regimen?\nOptions:\nA. Maintain current therapy\nB. Add cromolyn prior to exercise\nC. Add fluticasone daily\nD. Add salmeterol twice daily\nE. Add zileuton twice daily\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Add fluticasone daily.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as increased use of albuterol inhaler, nighttime awakenings, and difficulty keeping up with friends during play, indicate that his asthma is not well-controlled. The presence of bilateral late expiratory wheezes on auscultation also suggests ongoing airway inflammation.\n\nAccording to asthma treatment guidelines, a step-up in therapy is indicated when a patient's symptoms are not well-controlled. In this case, adding a daily inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) such as fluticasone is the appropriate next step. ICS therapy helps to reduce airway inflammation and improve lung function.\n\nOptions A, B, and E are not correct because they do not address the underlying airway inflammation and do not provide adequate control of the patient's symptoms. Option D, adding salmeterol, may be considered in the future if the patient's symptoms are still not well-controlled after adding an ICS, but it is not the best initial step-up in therapy.",

She has not had any changes in diet or lifestyle but reports weight loss despite an increase in appetite. In addition, she has been experiencing chest palpitations, increased frequency of diarrhea, and heat intolerance. Physical exam of her thyroid is unremarkable but her TSH was found to be 0.21 mIU/L. A complex structure in her right ovary was detected on ultrasound. Her symptoms can be explained by which of the following?\nOptions:\nA. Meigs syndrome\nB. Jod-Basedow phenomenon\nC. Dermoid cyst\nD. Struma ovarii\nE. Immature teratoma\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Struma ovarii.\n\nStruma ovarii is a rare ovarian tumor that is composed of thyroid tissue. It can produce thyroid hormones, leading to hyperthyroidism. The symptoms described in the question, such as weight loss, increased appetite, chest palpitations, diarrhea, and heat intolerance, are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The low TSH level also supports this diagnosis. The complex structure in the right ovary detected on ultrasound is likely the struma ovarii tumor.\n\nMeigs syndrome (A) is a rare condition characterized by a benign ovarian tumor, ascites, and pleural effusion. While it can cause pelvic pain, it does not explain the thyroid-related symptoms.\n\nJod-Basedow phenomenon (B) is a rare condition in which iodine exposure triggers hyperthyroidism in individuals with underlying thyroid disease. It does not explain the ovarian tumor.\n\nDermoid cyst (C) is a type of ovarian tumor that can contain various tissues, including skin, hair, and teeth. While it can cause pelvic pain, it does not typically produce thyroid hormones.\n\nImmature teratoma (E) is a type of ovarian tumor that contains immature cells from various tissues. It can cause pelvic pain, but it does not typically produce thyroid hormones.",

He also complains of a gradual decrease in vision over the past 3 months. He is a bodybuilding competitor and has a competition coming up in 1 week. The man reports that his symptoms appeared suddenly, 30 minutes after he took 2 foreign-manufactured fat-burning pills instead of the 1 he usually takes. His blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, heart rate is 137/min, respiratory rate is 26/min, and temperature is 39.9\u00b0C (103.8\u00b0F). Physical examination reveals a reddish maculopapular rash over the patient\u2019s trunk, diminished lung and heart sounds, tenderness to palpation in his abdomen, and rotational bilateral nystagmus with an alternating gaze-dependent fast component.

The patient\u2019s condition is due to a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction triggered by the drug.\nE. The drug has stimulated the hypothalamic temperature center to produce hyperthermia.\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. The drug caused uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, and sweating, are consistent with a condition known as thyrotoxic crisis or thyroid storm. The presence of bilateral cataracts and a gradual decrease in vision over the past 3 months suggests that the patient has underlying hypothyroidism.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are likely caused by the fat-burning pills, which contain thyroxine (T4) or triiodothyronine (T3), thyroid hormones that can stimulate the body's metabolic rate. The sudden increase in thyroid hormone levels can cause uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation, leading to an increase in heat production and oxygen consumption. This can result in the symptoms observed in the patient, including fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. The patient's symptoms are not caused by an increased concentration of epinephrine released by the adrenal glands.\n\nC. There is no evidence of bacterial contamination of the pills, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a pyretic reaction.\n\nD.

The episodes occur every 1\u20132 months and last for a few hours. The pain is located in the epigastrium, radiates to his back, and is occasionally associated with mild nausea. His mother is concerned that his condition might be hereditary because his older sister was diagnosed with congenital heart disease. He is otherwise healthy and has met all developmental milestones. He is at the 75th percentile for height and the 65th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows no abdominal distention, guarding, or rebound tenderness. Which of the following congenital conditions would best explain this patient's symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis\nB. Biliary cyst\nC. Tracheoesophageal fistula\nD. Intestinal malrotation\nE. Pancreas divisum\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Pancreas divisum.\n\nThe symptoms described, such as episodic abdominal pain in the epigastrium that radiates to the back, are consistent with pancreatitis. Pancreas divisum is a congenital anomaly where the pancreas fails to fuse properly, resulting in two separate ducts that drain into the duodenum. This can cause recurrent pancreatitis, which matches the patient's symptoms.\n\nThe other options do not fit the patient's symptoms:\n\nA. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis typically presents in infancy with projectile vomiting and is not associated with episodic abdominal pain.\n\nB. Biliary cysts are typically associated with jaundice and right upper quadrant pain, not epigastric pain.\n\nC. Tracheoesophageal fistula is a congenital anomaly that affects the esophagus and trachea, not the pancreas, and would not cause the described symptoms.\n\nD. Intestinal malrotation can cause abdominal pain, but it is typically associated with vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal distension, which are not present in this patient.",

Diacyglycerol\nE. High-density lipoprotein\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. HMG-CoA.\n\nAtorvastatin is a statin medication that inhibits the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is involved in the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. By inhibiting this enzyme, atorvastatin decreases the production of cholesterol in the liver, leading to a decrease in LDL cholesterol levels.\n\nHMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) is an intermediate in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. With atorvastatin therapy, the levels of HMG-CoA will decrease as the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase is inhibited.\n\nThe other options are not directly affected by atorvastatin therapy:\n\nA. Mevalonate is a precursor to cholesterol synthesis, but its levels will not decrease with atorvastatin therapy.\n\nB. Acetoacetyl-CoA is an intermediate in the synthesis of ketone bodies, not directly related to cholesterol synthesis.\n\nD. Diacylglycerol is a precursor to triglyceride synthesis, not directly related to cholesterol synthesis.\n\nE. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels may actually increase with atorvastatin therapy, as statins can increase the expression of genes involved in HDL synthesis.",

His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/88 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. His skin and mucous membranes are dry on physical exam. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 154 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 4.3 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 27 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 99 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following is the best next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. 0.45% saline IV\nB. 0.9% saline IV\nC. 5% dextrose IV\nD. 5% dextrose IV with 0.45% saline IV\nE. Oral free water replacement\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. 5% dextrose IV with 0.45% saline IV.\n\nThe patient is experiencing high drainage output (>1 liter/day) from the pancreaticoduodenectomy, which suggests a pancreatic fistula. The patient's laboratory values indicate a hypochloremic, hyperbicarbonatemic metabolic alkalosis, which is consistent with a pancreatic fistula. The patient's dry skin and mucous membranes, along with the laboratory values, suggest that the patient is volume-depleted.\n\nThe best next step in management is to administer 5% dextrose IV with 0.45% saline IV to address the patient's volume depletion and electrolyte imbalance. This solution will help to replenish fluids, electrolytes, and glucose, while also helping to correct the metabolic alkalosis.\n\nOption A (0.45% saline IV) may not provide enough glucose to address the patient's volume depletion and electrolyte imbalance. Option B (0.9% saline IV) may exacerbate the patient's metabolic alkalosis. Option C (5% dextrose IV) may not provide enough electrolytes to address the patient's electrolyte imbalance. Option E (oral free water replacement) is not appropriate for a patient who is volume-depleted and requires IV fluids.",

The new screening test has greater statistical power than the gold standard.\nB. Repeating the study would have no effect on the statistical power of the screening test.\nC. The power of the test is 0.8.\nD. If the specificity of this screening test were increased, the statistical power would increase.\nE. If the sensitivity of this screening test were decreased, the statistical power would decrease.\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. If the sensitivity of this screening test were decreased, the statistical power would decrease.\n\nStatistical power refers to the ability of a test to detect a true effect or difference. In this case, the power of the screening test is related to its ability to detect the rare disorder.\n\nSensitivity refers to the proportion of true positives (disease present and test positive) among all those who actually have the disease. In this case, the sensitivity is 45/(45+5) = 0.9.\n\nThe power of the test is not directly given in the options, but it is related to the sensitivity.

She previously presented with itching, as well as frequent and painful urination. A vaginal swab was taken and sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. Diplococci were seen on Gram stain and were grown on Thayer-Martin agar. When discussing her infection, the patient says that she uses safe sex practices. Her history is significant for meningitis and for infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The physician discusses that the reason behind these infections comes from a defect in the innate immune system. Which of the following best describes the component that is likely deficient in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Acts as an important opsonin  \nB. Plays a role in angioedema\nC. Degraded by C1 esterase inhibitor\nD. Creates pores in the cell membrane\nE. Induces the alternative complement pathway\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Acts as an important opsonin.\n\nThe patient's history of meningitis and infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as the current infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (indicated by the diplococci on Gram stain and growth on Thayer-Martin agar), suggests a deficiency in the complement system, specifically in the late complement components (C5-9). This is because the patient has had recurrent infections with encapsulated bacteria, which are typically opsonized by the complement system.\n\nThe correct answer, option A, refers to the fact that the late complement components (C5-9) act as important opsonins, helping to mark pathogens for phagocytosis and elimination by the immune system. A deficiency in these components would impair the body's ability to clear encapsulated bacteria, leading to recurrent infections.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:\n\nB. Bradykinin plays a role in angioedema, but this is not relevant to the patient's infections.\n\nC. C1 esterase inhibitor is involved in the regulation of the classical complement pathway, but its degradation is not directly related to the patient's condition.\n\nD. The formation of pores in the cell membrane is a function of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which is composed of the late complement components (C5-9). While this is related to the complement system, it is not the primary defect in this patient.\n\nE. The alternative complement pathway is a separate pathway that is not directly related to the patient's condition.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 55-year-old woman with papillary thyroid carcinoma underwent total thyroidectomy. She has no significant medical history. On postoperative day 1, she develops perioral numbness and a tingling sensation, along with paresthesia of the hands and feet. The physical examination reveals that she is anxious and confused. Her pulse is 90/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, the respirations are 22/min, and the temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F). Latent tetany (carpal spasm) is evident in the right arm. This is observed when the sphygmomanometer cuff pressure is raised above the systolic blood pressure and held for 3 minutes. The laboratory test results are as follows:\nSerum calcium 6.7 mg/dL\nSerum sodium 143 mEq/L\nSerum potassium 4.4 mEq/L\nSerum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL\nBlood urea 16 mg/dL\nSerum magnesium 1.1 mEq/L\nWhat is the most likely cause of this condition?\nOptions:\nA. Inadvertent surgical removal of parathyroid glands\nB. Congenital absence of parathyroid glands\nC. DiGeorge syndrome\nD. Chronic hypomagnesemia\nE. Hungry bone syndrome\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Inadvertent surgical removal of parathyroid glands.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as perioral numbness, tingling sensation, and paresthesia, are consistent with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels). The laboratory results show a low serum calcium level of 6.7 mg/dL, which supports this diagnosis. The presence of latent tetany (carpal spasm) also suggests hypocalcemia.\n\nThe most likely cause of hypocalcemia in this patient is inadvertent surgical removal of parathyroid glands during the total thyroidectomy. The parathyroid glands are located near the thyroid gland and can be accidentally removed or damaged during surgery, leading to hypoparathyroidism and subsequent hypocalcemia.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's history and laboratory results. DiGeorge syndrome is a congenital disorder that affects the development of the parathyroid glands, but it is not a likely cause of hypocalcemia in a 55-year-old woman who has undergone thyroid surgery. Chronic hypomagnesemia can contribute to hypocalcemia, but the patient's serum magnesium level is within the normal range. Hungry bone syndrome is a condition that occurs after parathyroid surgery, but it is characterized by severe hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, which is not seen in this patient.",

On examination, the patient is dyspneic and acrocyanotic. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral rales over the lower lobes. A cardiac examination is significant for S2 accentuation best heard in the second intercostal space at the left sternal border and S3 presence. There is no leg edema. Neurological examination is within normal limits. Arterial blood gases analysis shows the following results:\npH 7.49\nPaO2 58 mm Hg\nPaCO2 30 mm Hg\nHCO3-  22 mEq/L\nBased on the given data, which of the following could cause respiratory failure in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli\nB. Ischemia of the medullary respiratory center neurons\nC. Alveolar fibrosis\nD. Depression of the respiratory center via opioid receptors activation\nE. Decreased V/Q due to bronchial obstruction\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE), which is a common complication of recent surgery, particularly in patients with a history of cancer and immobility. The patient's tachypnea, dyspnea, and hypoxia are consistent with PE. The accentuation of the S2 heart sound and the presence of an S3 gallop suggest right ventricular strain, which is also consistent with PE.\n\nThe arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.49, which is slightly alkalotic, and a PaO2 of 58 mm Hg, which is low. The PaCO2 is 30 mm Hg, which is slightly low, and the HCO3- is 22 mEq/L, which is normal. This suggests that the patient has a respiratory alkalosis, which is consistent with PE.\n\nOption A, increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli, is the most likely cause of respiratory failure in this patient. Pulmonary embolism can cause a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion, leading to increased alveolar dead space and respiratory failure.\n\nOption B, ischemia of the medullary respiratory center neurons, is unlikely to be the cause of respiratory failure in this patient, as there is no evidence of neurological dysfunction.\n\nOption C, alveolar fibrosis, is not supported by the patient's symptoms or examination findings.\n\nOption D, depression of the respiratory center via opioid receptors activation, is possible given the patient's history of opioid abuse, but it is less likely to be the primary cause of respiratory failure in this patient.\n\nOption E, decreased V/Q due to bronchial obstruction, is not supported by the patient's symptoms or examination findings, and bronchial obstruction would not typically cause the patient's symptoms and blood gas abnormalities.",

Immune response to streptococcal infection.\n\nThe patient's laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which is a complication of certain bacterial infections, including Streptococcus. The patient's history of impetigo, a skin infection caused by Streptococcus, one month prior to presentation, suggests that this may be the underlying cause of her current illness.\n\nThe laboratory findings that support this diagnosis include:\n\n* Hemolytic anemia, evidenced by the low hemoglobin and hematocrit, and the presence of schistocytes on peripheral smear (not mentioned in the question, but likely present).\n* Thrombocytopenia, evidenced by the low platelet count.\n* Acute kidney injury, evidenced by the elevated creatinine and BUN.\n* Positive urine protein, which is consistent with glomerular damage.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's laboratory findings:\n\n* A. Alcohol-induced liver injury would be expected to cause elevated liver enzymes, which are only mildly elevated in this patient.\n* C. Intestinal IgA deficiency is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or laboratory findings.\n* D. Myoglobin toxicity would be expected to cause a higher creatinine kinase level, which is not mentioned in the question.\n* E.

The mother states that she wants her daughter to have a bilateral tubal ligation after she recently discovered her looking at pornographic materials. She states that her daughter is not capable of understanding the repercussions of sexual intercourse, and that she does not want her to be burdened with a child that she would not be able to raise. Upon discussions with the patient, it is clear that she is not able to understand that sexual intercourse can lead to pregnancy. What should your next step be?\nOptions:\nA. Schedule the patient for the requested surgery\nB. Wait until the patient is 18 years old, and then schedule for surgery\nC. Refuse the procedure because it violates the ethical principle of autonomy\nD. Refer the patient to a psychiatrist to get informed consent\nE. Refuse the procedure because it is unlikely that the patient will get pregnant\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Refuse the procedure because it violates the ethical principle of autonomy.\n\nAs a healthcare provider, it is essential to prioritize the patient's autonomy and decision-making capacity. In this scenario, the patient is not capable of understanding the repercussions of sexual intercourse, including pregnancy, and therefore cannot provide informed consent for the procedure. Performing the surgery without the patient's informed consent would violate her autonomy and be unethical.\n\nAdditionally, sterilization of individuals with mental disabilities without their informed consent is a controversial and potentially discriminatory practice. It is essential to prioritize the patient's rights and dignity, rather than making decisions based on the mother's concerns or assumptions about the patient's capabilities.\n\nReferring the patient to a psychiatrist to obtain informed consent (Option D) may not be sufficient, as the patient's lack of understanding about sexual intercourse and pregnancy suggests that she may not be able to provide informed consent. Waiting until the patient is 18 years old (Option B) is also not a viable solution, as the patient's capacity for informed consent is not solely dependent on her age. Option E is not relevant to the scenario, as the patient's likelihood of getting pregnant is not the primary concern.",

Combined antacid therapy\nC. Continue on Cimetidine\nD. Continue on Omeprazole\nE. Surgical gastropexy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Surgical gastropexy.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and barium swallow results suggest a large hiatal hernia, which is a type of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Distributive shock with warm skin.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with distributive shock, which is a type of shock characterized by vasodilation and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. This leads to a decrease in blood pressure, despite an increase in cardiac output. The patient's warm skin is a hallmark of distributive shock, as the vasodilation causes blood to flow to the periphery, resulting in warm and flushed skin.\n\nThe patient's history of a cut on his foot, followed by the development of painful redness spreading up his leg, suggests an infection, which is supported by the presence of gram-negative bacilli on Gram stain.

She states that this has been one of many symptoms she has experienced lately. At times she has had trouble speaking and has noticed changes in her vision however these episodes occurred over a month ago and have resolved since then. Two days ago she experienced extreme pain in her face that was exacerbated with brushing her teeth and plucking out facial hairs. The patient has no relevant past medical history, however, the patient admits to being sexually abused by her boyfriend for the past year. Her current medications include ibuprofen for menstrual cramps. On physical exam it is noted that leftward gaze results in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward. The patient's initial workup is started in the emergency department. Her vital signs are within normal limits and you note a pale and frightened young lady awaiting further care. Which of the following is the best initial test for this patient's chief complaint?\nOptions:\nA. Head CT\nB. Head MRI\nC. Lumbar puncture\nD. Post void residual volumes\nE. Domestic abuse screening and exploring patient's life stressors\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Post void residual volumes.\n\nThe patient's chief complaint is an inability to urinate, which suggests a possible urinary retention issue. Post void residual (PVR) volumes are a non-invasive test that measures the amount of urine left in the bladder after urination. This test can help diagnose urinary retention and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms.\n\nWhile the patient's history and physical exam findings suggest a possible neurological disorder, such as multiple sclerosis, the initial focus should be on addressing the patient's acute symptom of urinary retention. The other options, such as head CT, head MRI, and lumbar puncture, may be relevant for evaluating the patient's neurological symptoms, but they are not the best initial test for her chief complaint.\n\nDomestic abuse screening and exploring patient's life stressors (option E) is an important aspect of the patient's care, but it is not directly related to the patient's chief complaint of urinary retention.",

The patient reports that his bowel habits have changed from every day to every 3 or 4 days. He also now has to strain to pass stool. On further questioning, his wife has also noticed that he has seemed fatigued, with little interest in going on their usual afternoon walks. Medical history is notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both managed medically. He was last seen for follow-up of these conditions 1 month ago. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the cellular target of the medicine that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Angiotensin-II receptors in the membranes of vascular smooth muscle cells\nB. Angiotensin-converting enzyme\nC. Calcium channels in the membranes of vascular smooth muscle cells\nD. Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the membranes of epithelial cells in the distal convoluted tubule\nE. Na+/K+/2Cl- transporters in the membranes of epithelial cells in the ascending loop of Henle\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the membranes of epithelial cells in the distal convoluted tubule.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of constipation, fatigue, and decreased interest in activities suggest hypokalemia (low potassium levels) as a possible cause. The patient's medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, and the fact that he was seen for follow-up 1 month ago, suggest that his medications may be contributing to his symptoms.\n\nThe most likely culprit is a thiazide diuretic, which is commonly used to treat hypertension. Thiazide diuretics work by inhibiting the Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, leading to increased sodium and water excretion in the urine. However, they can also cause potassium depletion, leading to hypokalemia and symptoms such as constipation, fatigue, and muscle weakness.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms:\n\nA. Angiotensin-II receptors are targeted by angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which are used to treat hypertension, but are not typically associated with hypokalemia.\n\nB. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is targeted by ACE inhibitors, which are used to treat hypertension and heart failure, but are not typically associated with hypokalemia.\n\nC. Calcium channels are targeted by calcium channel blockers, which are used to treat hypertension and angina, but are not typically associated with hypokalemia.\n\nE. Na+/K+/2Cl- transporters are targeted by loop diuretics, which are used to treat edema and hypertension, but are not typically associated with hypokalemia.",

The patient smells of alcohol and is slurring his words. You find out that he has recently been fired from his job as a salesperson for months of tardiness and poor performance. The police tell you that his girlfriend, who was there at the time of the fall, mentioned that the patient has been struggling with alcohol for at least a year. Upon physical examination, the patient becomes agitated and starts yelling. He accuses his ex-boss of being a cocaine addict and says he couldn\u2019t keep up sales percentages compared to someone using cocaine. Which of the following psychiatric defense mechanisms is the patient demonstrating?\nOptions:\nA. Denial\nB. Displacement\nC. Projection\nD. Rationalization\nE. Regression\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Projection.\n\nThe patient is accusing his ex-boss of being a cocaine addict, which is a false attribution of one's own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to someone else. This is a classic example of projection, a defense mechanism in which an individual attributes their own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or impulses to someone else. In this case, the patient is likely struggling with his own substance abuse issues (alcohol) and is projecting those feelings onto his ex-boss.",

Her symptoms began 1 week ago with a severe fever (40\u2103 (104\u2109)) for 3 days. When the fever subsided, she developed a maculopapular rash over the trunk and extremities with painful wrists and fingers. She also reports abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Last week she returned from a trip to Africa where she spent several weeks, mostly in rural areas. Her temperature is 37.5\u2103 (99.5\u2109); pulse is 75/min; respiratory rate is 13/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. A maculopapular rash is observed over the trunk and limbs. Both ankles are swollen and painful to active and passive motion. The abdomen is soft without organomegaly. Laboratory studies show the following:\nLaboratory test\nHemoglobin 11.4 g/d\nMean corpuscular volume 90 \u00b5m3\nLeukocyte count 4,500/mm3\nSegmented neutrophils 70%\nLymphocytes 15%\nPlatelet count 250,000/mm3\nRing-form trophozoites are absent on the peripheral blood smear.

Tropheryma whipplei\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Chikungunya virus.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including the severe fever, maculopapular rash, and painful joints (especially the ankles), are consistent with Chikungunya virus infection. The patient's travel history to rural Africa, where Chikungunya is endemic, also supports this diagnosis. The laboratory results, including the normal platelet count and absence of ring-form trophozoites on the peripheral blood smear, rule out other possibilities such as Dengue fever and Babesiosis. Leishmania major is typically associated with cutaneous lesions, and Tropheryma whipplei is associated with Whipple's disease, which is a rare gastrointestinal disorder.",

She does not have pain. She has nausea but has not vomited. She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 1 month ago. She has been using an incentive spirometer every 6 hours since recovering from her surgery. Prior to admission, her only medications were a multivitamin and an herbal weight-loss preparation. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg. Examination shows mild swelling of the right thigh to the ankle; there is no erythema or pitting edema. Homan's sign is negative. The abdomen is soft and shows diffuse tenderness to palpation. There are five abdominal laparoscopic incisions with no erythema or discharge. The lungs are clear to auscultation. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.

His symptoms only lasted for a few seconds and resolved spontaneously. This is the third time he experienced such an episode. He says that he recently started having nightmares. His father died of sudden cardiac death at the age of 45 years without a history of hypertension or any chronic cardiac disorder. A complete physical examination was normal. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevations in V1, V2, and V3, and the presence of incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB). After a complete diagnostic evaluation, Brugada syndrome was diagnosed. He has prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers. The drug also blocks potassium channels and prolongs action potential duration, but it does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. The drug also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity.

Systemic vascular resistance.\n\nThe patient is presenting with signs of shock, including tachycardia, hypotension, and decreased peripheral perfusion (decreased radial pulses and delayed capillary refill). This is likely due to hypovolemia from vomiting and possible gastrointestinal bleeding. In response to hypovolemia, the body normally increases systemic vascular resistance (vasoconstriction) to try to maintain blood pressure. However, in this patient, the systemic vascular resistance is likely decreased due to the effects of chronic alcoholism, which can cause vasodilation and decreased vascular tone. This decreased systemic vascular resistance would exacerbate the hypotension and contribute to the patient's shock state.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 69-year-old male with a longstanding history of hypertension and high cholesterol presents with abdominal pain and \u2018bruising on his feet\u2019. The patient states that his symptoms started about a week ago and have steadily worsened. He describes the abdominal pain as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The cardiac exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Carotid bruit present on the right. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds present. A pulsatile abdominal mass is felt in the lower umbilical region. Patient\u2019s feet have the following appearance seen in the picture. Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm). High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are initiated. Morphine sulfate and metoprolol are administered. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?\n \nOptions:\nA. Discharge with clinical surveillance and annual ultrasound\nB. Discharge with clinical surveillance and ultrasound every 6 months\nC. Elective endovascular repair\nD. Elective open surgical repair\nE. Emergency open surgical repair\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Elective endovascular repair.\n\nThe patient has a small, unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with a diameter of 4.1 cm, which is below the typical threshold for surgical intervention (usually 5.5 cm). However, the patient is symptomatic, with abdominal pain and a pulsatile abdominal mass, which indicates that the aneurysm is growing and may be at risk of rupture.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and the presence of a pulsatile abdominal mass, elective endovascular repair is the best course of treatment. This approach is less invasive than open surgical repair and has been shown to be effective in managing small to moderate-sized AAAs.\n\nDischarging the patient with clinical surveillance and ultrasound monitoring (options A and B) is not appropriate, as the patient is symptomatic and the aneurysm may continue to grow and rupture.\n\nEmergency open surgical repair (option E) is not necessary, as the aneurysm is not ruptured and the patient is stable.\n\nElective open surgical repair (option D) may be considered, but endovascular repair is generally preferred for small to moderate-sized AAAs due to its less invasive nature and lower risk of complications.",

Hi temperature is 102.8\u00b0F (39.3 \u00b0C), blood pressure is 137/80 mmHg, pulse is 104/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98%. Chest exam reveals a deep noise found bilaterally in the lung bases. Chest radiograph reveals a wider area of opacity near the heart and bilateral lung infiltrates. Which of the following is characteristic of the most likely organism responsible for this patient's symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Captain's wheel appearance\nB. Cultured on charcoal and yeast\nC. D-glutamate capsule\nD. Found in desert sand\nE. Polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate capsule\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Cultured on charcoal and yeast.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and chest radiograph are consistent with Legionnaires' disease, which is caused by Legionella pneumophila. Legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative bacterium that requires charcoal and yeast extract to grow in culture, hence option B is the correct answer.\n\nOption A refers to the characteristic appearance of Streptococcus pneumoniae on a Gram stain.\n\nOption C refers to the capsule of Bacillus anthracis.\n\nOption D refers to Coccidioides immitis, a fungus that causes Valley fever.\n\nOption E refers to the capsule of Haemophilus influenzae.",

He smokes 2 packs per day and drinks 2\u20133 beers every day. He denies any previous medical problems except for seasonal allergies for which he takes diphenhydramine on occasions. At the hospital, the vital signs include: temperature 40.0\u00b0C (104.0\u00b0F), blood pressure 140/80 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, and respiratory rate 28/min. On physical exam, he is thin and poorly kept. His clothes appear dirty. Small scars are visible in the decubitus region of both arms. The lung sounds are equal with bilateral crackles, and heart auscultation reveals a systolic murmur that radiates to the left axilla. Petechiae are seen on the hard palate and palms of his hands. A chest X-ray and blood cultures are ordered. What is the most likely organism causing his symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Streptococci viridans\nB. Enterococci\nC. Staphylococcus aureus\nD. Aspergillus fumigatus\nE. Staphylococcus epidermidis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain, are consistent with pneumonia. The presence of petechiae on the hard palate and palms of his hands suggests a bacterial infection, particularly endocarditis. The systolic murmur that radiates to the left axilla also supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe patient's history of smoking and drinking, as well as the small scars on his arms, suggest that he may be an intravenous drug user, which increases his risk of developing endocarditis. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of endocarditis, particularly in intravenous drug users.\n\nWhile Streptococci viridans (Option A) and Enterococci (Option B) can also cause endocarditis, they are less likely to cause pneumonia and are not typically associated with petechiae. Aspergillus fumigatus (Option D) is a fungal pathogen that can cause pneumonia, but it is less likely to cause endocarditis and petechiae. Staphylococcus epidermidis (Option E) is a common skin commensal that can cause infections, but it is less likely to cause pneumonia and endocarditis.",

About 90 minutes ago she was on the couch watching television with her husband when she suddenly noticed that she couldn't see the screen normally. She also felt a little dizzy. She has never had anything like this happen before. Her general physical exam is unremarkable. Her neurologic exam is notable for loss of vision in the right visual field of both eyes with macular sparing, though extraocular movements are intact. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head shows no acute intracranial process. Angiography of the brain will most likely show a lesion in which of the following vessels?\nOptions:\nA. Internal carotid artery\nB. Anterior cerebral artery\nC. Middle cerebral artery\nD. Posterior cerebral artery\nE. Basilar artery\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Posterior cerebral artery.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and exam findings are consistent with a posterior cerebral artery (PCA) stroke. The PCA supplies the visual cortex, and a lesion in this vessel can cause a homonymous hemianopia (loss of vision in the same side of the visual field in both eyes) with macular sparing, as seen in this patient. The PCA is also a common location for ischemic strokes, especially in older adults.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\nA. Internal carotid artery: A lesion in the internal carotid artery would more likely cause a contralateral hemiparesis and hemisensory loss, rather than a visual field defect.\n\nB. Anterior cerebral artery: The anterior cerebral artery supplies the medial aspect of the frontal and parietal lobes, and a lesion in this vessel would more likely cause a contralateral hemiparesis and cognitive deficits.\n\nC. Middle cerebral artery: The middle cerebral artery supplies the lateral aspect of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, and a lesion in this vessel would more likely cause a contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, and language deficits.\n\nE. Basilar artery: The basilar artery supplies the brainstem and cerebellum, and a lesion in this vessel would more likely cause a brainstem syndrome, such as a locked-in syndrome or a coma, rather than a visual field defect.",

She reports that the child cries several times per day, but sleeps 7-8 hours at night, uninterrupted. She has been breastfeeding the infant but feels the latch has been poor and is unsure how much milk he has been consuming but feels it is not enough. A lactation consult was called for the patient and it was noted that despite proper instruction the observed latch was still poor. When asked the mother stated that the baby is currently making stools 2 times per day. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's presentation?\nOptions:\nA. Breast milk jaundice\nB. Breastfeeding jaundice\nC. Sepsis\nD. Crigler-Najjar syndrome\nE. Physiologic hyperbilirubinemia\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Breastfeeding jaundice.\n\nThe patient's presentation is consistent with breastfeeding jaundice, which is a common cause of jaundice in newborns. The mother's report of poor latch and uncertainty about milk consumption, along with the infant's infrequent stools (2 times per day), suggest that the baby may not be getting enough milk, leading to dehydration and increased bilirubin levels. Breastfeeding jaundice typically occurs in the first week of life and is more common in breastfed babies.\n\nPhysiologic hyperbilirubinemia (option E) is also a possibility, but it typically peaks around 5-7 days of life, and the infant's symptoms are more consistent with breastfeeding jaundice.\n\nBreast milk jaundice (option A) is a different entity that occurs later in life, typically around 7-10 days, and is caused by a substance in breast milk that inhibits bilirubin conjugation.\n\nSepsis (option C) is unlikely given the infant's overall well-being and lack of other symptoms.\n\nCrigler-Najjar syndrome (option D) is a rare genetic disorder that causes severe jaundice, but it is not consistent with the patient's presentation.",

The patient says that he has been limping with mild pain for the past three weeks, but the pain acutely worsened today. He describes the pain as severe, non-radiating, sharp and aching in character, and localized to the right hip and knee joints. The patient denies recent illness, travel, trauma, or similar symptoms in the past. No significant past medical history and no current medications. The patient is not sexually active and denies any alcohol, smoking or drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, pulse 72/min, respiratory rate 15/min, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Body mass index (BMI) is 32 kg/m2. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The right leg is externally rotated, and there is a limited range of motion in the right hip. Strength is 4 out of 5 at the right hip joint and 5 out of 5 elsewhere. There is no tenderness to palpation. No joint erythema, edema or effusion present. Sensation is intact. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory tests are unremarkable. Plain radiographs of the right hip joint are significant for displacement of the right femoral head inferoposterior off the femoral neck. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of treatment for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Reassess in 3 months\nB. Immobilize the right knee with conservative treatment (i.e. rest, ice)\nC. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection of the right hip joint\nD. Pavlik harness\nE. Surgical pinning of the right hip\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Surgical pinning of the right hip.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), a condition in which the epiphysis (growth plate) of the femur slips out of place, causing the femoral head to move posteriorly and inferiorly. The plain radiographs of the right hip joint showing displacement of the right femoral head inferoposterior off the femoral neck support this diagnosis.\n\nSurgical pinning of the right hip is the most appropriate course of treatment for this patient. This involves placing a screw or pin across the growth plate to stabilize the femoral head and prevent further slippage. This procedure is usually performed urgently to prevent further complications, such as avascular necrosis of the femoral head.\n\nThe other options are not appropriate:\n\nA. Reassessing in 3 months would delay treatment and potentially lead to further complications.\n\nB. Immobilizing the right knee with conservative treatment would not address the underlying condition and may not provide adequate stabilization of the femoral head.\n\nC. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection of the right hip joint would not be effective in treating SCFE and may even exacerbate the condition.\n\nD. A Pavlik harness is used to treat developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in infants, not SCFE in adolescents.",

The presence of a non-tender mass in the left testis, which is not transilluminable, is consistent with a testicular tumor. Leydig cell tumors are a type of testicular tumor that can produce excess estrogen, leading to gynecomastia. The patient's history of testicular trauma is unlikely to be the cause of the gynecomastia, as trauma would not typically cause a hormonal imbalance. Obesity (option B) can cause gynecomastia, but it would not typically cause a testicular mass.

Nocturnal penile tumescence testing.\n\nThis patient presents with erectile dysfunction, which can have both physical and psychological causes. Before initiating treatment, it's essential to determine whether the problem is primarily psychological or organic. Nocturnal penile tumescence testing is a non-invasive, first-line diagnostic test that can help distinguish between psychological and organic erectile dysfunction. It measures the frequency and quality of erections that occur naturally during sleep. If the test shows normal nocturnal erections, it suggests that the problem is likely psychological, and psychotherapy (option A) may be a suitable next step. If the test shows abnormal or absent nocturnal erections, it suggests an organic cause, and further evaluation and treatment would be necessary.\n\nThe other options are not the most appropriate next step in management:\n\nB. Penile prosthesis insertion is a surgical intervention that is typically considered only after other treatments have failed.\n\nC. Intracavernous prostaglandin E1 injections are a treatment option for erectile dysfunction, but they should not be initiated without first evaluating the underlying cause of the problem.\n\nE.

The patient has a history of mild intermittent asthma and has been using his albuterol inhaler without relief. He has also been complaining of headache and sore throat, and his mother has noticed worsening rhinorrhea. The patient\u2019s past medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and he has no known drug allergies. In the office, his temperature is 101.8\u00b0F (38.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 88/65 mmHg, pulse is 132/min, and respirations are 16/min. The patient has purulent mucus draining from the nares, and his face is tender to palpation over the maxillary sinuses. His pharynx is erythematous with symmetric swelling of the tonsils. On lung exam, he has moderate bilateral expiratory wheezing.\n\nWhich of the following is the best next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Amoxicillin\nB. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid\nC. Ampicillin-sulbactam\nD. Clindamycin\nE. Levofloxacin\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including a 10-day history of cough, worsening rhinorrhea, purulent mucus draining from the nares, and facial tenderness over the maxillary sinuses, are consistent with a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis. The patient's history of mild intermittent asthma and lack of response to albuterol inhaler suggest that the cough is not solely due to asthma.\n\nAmoxicillin-clavulanic acid is a suitable choice for treating acute bacterial sinusitis in children, as it covers the common pathogens involved, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. The addition of clavulanic acid helps to combat beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.\n\nOption A, amoxicillin, may not be effective against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Option C, ampicillin-sulbactam, is not typically used in pediatric patients. Option D, clindamycin, is not a first-line choice for sinusitis and may not cover H. influenzae. Option E, levofloxacin, is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is not typically used in pediatric patients due to concerns about cartilage damage and other side effects.",

The patient has been trying to get pregnant and was successful recently, but now she is experiencing abdominal pain, contractions, and a bloody vaginal discharge. According to her last appointment with her primary care provider, she is 10 weeks pregnant. The patient has a past medical history of constipation, anxiety, and substance abuse. She is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a bloody vaginal discharge and an open cervix. The patient is initially extremely grateful for the care she is receiving and thanks the doctor and the nursing staff for saving her baby. Upon hearing the news that she is having a spontaneous abortion, the patient becomes angry and aggressive and states that her physician and the medical staff are incompetent, evil, and she is going to sue all of them. The patient is left to grieve but upon entering the room again you notice that the patient has new lacerations over her wrists and that some of the medical equipment in the room is broken. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Acute stress response\nB. Antisocial personality disorder\nC. Borderline personality disorder\nD. Normal grief response\nE. Post-traumatic stress disorder\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Borderline personality disorder.\n\nThe patient's behavior, as described, is consistent with borderline personality disorder. The patient initially presents as grateful and cooperative, but then suddenly becomes angry, aggressive, and accusatory when faced with the news of her miscarriage. This intense emotional dysregulation and rapid shift in mood are characteristic of borderline personality disorder.\n\nAdditionally, the patient's self-harming behavior (lacerations on her wrists) and destructive behavior (breaking medical equipment) are also consistent with borderline personality disorder.\n\nAcute stress response (A) is a possible diagnosis, but it would not typically involve self-harming behavior or destructive behavior towards others.\n\nAntisocial personality disorder (B) is not supported by the patient's behavior, as it is characterized by a lack of empathy and impulsivity, but not necessarily by emotional dysregulation or self-harming behavior.\n\nNormal grief response (D) is not a likely diagnosis, as the patient's behavior goes beyond what would be expected in a normal grief response.\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (E) is not supported by the patient's behavior, as it typically involves symptoms related to a traumatic event, such as flashbacks or avoidance, which are not described in this scenario.",

She denies any previous episodes of hematuria. She reports taking high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin over several weeks due to persistent upper back pain. The patient\u2019s blood pressure and temperature are normal, but she is found to have proteinuria. Physical examination is negative for palpable flank masses. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis:\nOptions:\nA. Diffuse cortical necrosis\nB. Chronic pyelonephritis\nC. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease\nD. Papillary necrosis\nE. Acute Nephrolithiasis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Papillary necrosis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of gross hematuria and acute, colicky flank pain are consistent with a diagnosis of nephrolithiasis (kidney stones). However, the additional information about the patient's history of taking high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin, as well as the presence of proteinuria, suggests that papillary necrosis is a more likely diagnosis.\n\nPapillary necrosis is a condition in which the papillae of the kidneys become damaged, leading to necrosis and sloughing of the tissue. This can cause hematuria, flank pain, and proteinuria. The use of high doses of analgesics, such as acetaminophen and aspirin, is a known risk factor for papillary necrosis.\n\nDiffuse cortical necrosis (A) is a rare condition that typically occurs in the setting of severe hypertension, sepsis, or obstetric complications. Chronic pyelonephritis (B) is a chronic infection of the kidneys that typically presents with more subtle symptoms and is not typically associated with acute flank pain and hematuria. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (C) is a genetic disorder that typically presents with bilateral flank masses and is not typically associated with acute hematuria and flank pain. Acute nephrolithiasis (E) is a possible diagnosis, but the presence of proteinuria and the patient's history of analgesic use make papillary necrosis a more likely diagnosis.",

The pain developed over time and now limits his mobility. He states that the pain is worse at the end of the day, though he does have some early-morning stiffness lasting about 20 minutes. He used to have some success with over-the-counter NSAIDs; however, they no longer help. The patient also has been taking metformin for the past 2 years and is severely obese, with a BMI of 41 kg/m2. Additionally, he states that he has felt increasingly tired during the day, often dozes off during work, and no longer feels refreshed when he wakes up in the morning. Upon examination, there is no tenderness on palpation or erythema; however, some crepitus is felt. He has no other complaints but has a family history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on his mother\u2019s side. Which of the following factors is the underlying cause of the patient\u2019s pain, as well as the rest of his complaints?\nOptions:\nA. Autoimmune disease\nB. Medication side effect\nC. Excess weight\nD. Infection\nE. Occult malignancy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Excess weight.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including bilateral knee pain, stiffness, and crepitus, are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA), which is a degenerative joint disease. The patient's severe obesity (BMI of 41 kg/m2) is likely the underlying cause of his OA, as excess weight puts additional stress on the joints, particularly the weight-bearing joints such as the knees.\n\nThe patient's fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and lack of refreshment upon waking are also likely related to his obesity and sleep apnea, which is a common comorbidity of obesity.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest an autoimmune disease (A) such as rheumatoid arthritis, as the patient does not have tenderness, erythema, or other signs of inflammation. There is also no indication of a medication side effect (B) or infection (D) causing the patient's symptoms. Occult malignancy (E) is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms, as there is no mention of other symptoms or signs that would suggest cancer.",

Reidel thyroiditis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of Reidel thyroiditis, a rare inflammatory condition of the thyroid gland. The key features that support this diagnosis are:\n\n* Stony hard, tender, and asymmetrically enlarged thyroid gland\n* Pain associated with swallowing\n* Low radioactive iodine uptake on radionuclide thyroid scanning\n* Elevated T4 level and normal TSH level, indicating thyroid hormone production is not suppressed\n* Presence of systemic symptoms such as fatigue, constipation, and cold intolerance, which are consistent with hypothyroidism\n\nReidel thyroiditis is a chronic inflammatory condition that can cause thyroid hormone production to be impaired, leading to hypothyroidism. The other options are not as likely based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:\n\n* Anaplastic carcinoma (A) is a type of thyroid cancer, but it is not typically associated with a tender and asymmetrically enlarged thyroid gland.\n* Medullary carcinoma (B) is a type of thyroid cancer that can cause thyroid hormone production to be impaired, but it is not typically associated with a stony hard thyroid gland.\n* Granulomatous thyroiditis (C) is an inflammatory condition of the thyroid gland, but it is typically associated with a tender and enlarged thyroid gland, and the patient's laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.\n* Silent thyroiditis (E) is a type of thyroiditis that can cause thyroid hormone production to be impaired, but it is not typically associated with a stony hard and tender thyroid gland.",

Which of the following correctly states:\n1) the cells of the kidney this compound acts on and\n2) the identity of compound X?\nOptions:\nA. Distal convoluted tubule; atrial natriuretic peptide\nB. Loop of Henle; furosemide\nC. Distal convoluted tubule; hydrochlorothiazide\nD. Principal cells; aldosterone\nE. Principal cells; spironolactone\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Principal cells; aldosterone.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The decrease in urinary sodium concentration suggests that the compound is increasing sodium reabsorption in the kidney.\n* The decrease in urinary pH suggests that the compound is increasing hydrogen ion secretion, which is also consistent with increased sodium reabsorption.\n* The increase in urinary potassium suggests that the compound is increasing potassium secretion, which is also consistent with increased sodium reabsorption.\n\nAldosterone is a hormone that acts on principal cells in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. It also stimulates hydrogen ion secretion, which helps to decrease urinary pH.\n\nThe other options do not fit the described effects:\n\n* Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) would decrease sodium reabsorption, not increase it.\n* Furosemide acts on the loop of Henle and would increase sodium excretion, not decrease it.\n* Hydrochlorothiazide acts on the distal convoluted tubule, but it would increase sodium excretion, not decrease it.\n* Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist, so it would have the opposite effects of aldosterone.",

He has a history of cirrhosis of the liver secondary to alcoholism. He started becoming more confused a few days ago and it has been getting gradually worse. His temperature is 98.8\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 134/90 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals a distended abdomen that is non-tender. Neurological exam is notable for a confused patient and asterixis. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 139 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 3.3 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 22 mEq/L\nBUN: 20 mg/dL\nGlucose: 59 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\nCa2+: 10.2 mg/dL\n\nWhich of the following is the best next treatment for this patient?\nOptions:\nA.

Lactulose.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including altered mental status, confusion, and asterixis, are consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of cirrhosis. The laboratory values are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level, but this is not the primary concern.\n\nLactulose is a medication that is commonly used to treat hepatic encephalopathy. It works by reducing the production of ammonia in the gut, which is a toxin that can contribute to hepatic encephalopathy. It is the best next treatment for this patient.\n\nCeftriaxone (A) is an antibiotic that may be used to treat infections, but it is not specifically indicated for hepatic encephalopathy. Dextrose (B) is a sugar that may be used to treat hypoglycemia, but the patient's glucose level is within normal limits. Potassium (D) supplementation may be necessary, but it is not the primary treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. Rifaximin (E) is an antibiotic that may be used to treat hepatic encephalopathy, but lactulose is a more commonly used and effective treatment.",

She feels solid food getting stuck in her chest behind the sternum. She does not have any issues with liquids. She has no coughing or nasal regurgitation. She has no hoarseness or weight loss. She reports occasional heartburn that has lasted for about a year. Her past medical history is significant for asthma and eczema. She has no history of any serious illness and takes no medications. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormal findings. An endoscopic image of the esophagus is shown. Mucosal biopsy shows eosinophilic infiltration. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time?\nOptions:\nA. Amlodipine\nB. Budesonide\nC. Fluconazole\nD. Nitroglycerin\nE. Omeprazole\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Budesonide.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and endoscopic image suggest eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a condition characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa. The symptoms of difficulty swallowing solid food, feeling of food getting stuck, and occasional heartburn are consistent with EoE. The mucosal biopsy showing eosinophilic infiltration confirms the diagnosis.\n\nBudesonide is a topical corticosteroid that is commonly used to treat EoE. It helps to reduce inflammation and eosinophilic infiltration in the esophagus, relieving symptoms of dysphagia and improving esophageal function.\n\nAmlodipine (A) is a calcium channel blocker used to treat hypertension, and is not indicated for EoE. Fluconazole (C) is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections, and is not relevant to this patient's condition. Nitroglycerin (D) is a vasodilator used to treat angina and heart failure, and is not indicated for EoE. Omeprazole (E) is a proton pump inhibitor used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but it is not the most appropriate treatment for EoE. While the patient does report occasional heartburn, the primary diagnosis is EoE, and budesonide is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy.",

On physical examination, the temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), the pulse is 120/min, the blood pressure is 114/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 32/min. Auscultation of the chest reveals bilateral wheezing. The physician asks the nurse to administer nebulized albuterol; however, the boy declines nebulized albuterol because of a history of palpitations that he experienced previously. The physician then prescribes nebulized ipratropium bromide, which results in significant clinical improvement. Which of the following second messenger systems is affected by the drug that improved the boy's symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) system\nB. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) system\nC. Arachidonic acid system\nD. Phosphoinositol system\nE. Tyrosine kinase system\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Phosphoinositol system.\n\nIpratropium bromide is an anticholinergic medication that works by blocking the action of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors in the airways. This leads to a decrease in the production of inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which are second messengers involved in the phosphoinositol system. By blocking this pathway, ipratropium bromide reduces the contraction of airway smooth muscle and increases airflow, leading to improvement in symptoms of bronchospasm.",

Monochorionic-diamniotic monozygotic.\n\nThe clues that suggest this are:\n\n* The twins are both female, which increases the likelihood of monozygosity (identical twins).\n* The twins have different birth weights, which is consistent with monochorionic-diamniotic twins, where one twin may receive more blood flow and nutrients than the other.\n* The smaller twin has a flattened nose and clubfoot, which may be related to compression or constraint in utero, consistent with monochorionic-diamniotic twins.\n* The hematocrit values are significantly different between the two twins, with the larger twin having a much higher hematocrit. This is consistent with twin-to-twin transfusion, which can occur in monochorionic-diamniotic twins.\n\nMonochorionic-diamniotic twins are identical twins that share a single placenta (monochorionic) but have separate amniotic sacs (diamniotic).

Over the past 8 months, his mother reports difficulty understanding the boy's speech. On occasion during this period, she has noticed that he does not respond when called by name and cannot follow 1-step instructions. He has a history of recurrent ear infections treated with antibiotics since birth. He is at the 60th percentile for length and 50th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. His speech is quiet and difficult to understand. Otoscopic examination shows retracted tympanic membranes bilaterally that are immobile on pneumatic otoscopy. Nasopharyngoscopy shows mild adenoid hypertrophy. Pure tone audiometry shows a conductive hearing loss of 26 dB on the right side and 28 dB on the left side. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Nasal decongestant therapy\nB. Adenoidectomy\nC. Tympanostomy tube insertion\nD. Antihistamine therapy\nE. Corticosteroid therapy\n\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Tympanostomy tube insertion.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a conductive hearing loss due to middle ear effusion, likely caused by recurrent ear infections and Eustachian tube dysfunction. The retracted and immobile tympanic membranes on otoscopy and the pure tone audiometry results support this diagnosis. The mild adenoid hypertrophy may be contributing to the Eustachian tube dysfunction.\n\nTympanostomy tube insertion is the most appropriate next step in management to drain the middle ear effusion and improve hearing. This procedure involves inserting small tubes into the eardrum to allow air to enter the middle ear and drain fluid.\n\nThe other options are not directly addressing the underlying cause of the conductive hearing loss:\n\nA. Nasal decongestant therapy may help with nasal congestion, but it will not address the middle ear effusion.\n\nB. Adenoidectomy may be considered in the future if the adenoid hypertrophy is contributing to the Eustachian tube dysfunction, but it is not the primary treatment for the conductive hearing loss.\n\nD. Antihistamine therapy is not relevant to the management of conductive hearing loss.\n\nE. Corticosteroid therapy may be used to reduce inflammation in the middle ear, but it is not a substitute for tympanostomy tube insertion in this case.",

His wife reports that 30 min following the onset of her husband\u2019s condition, which started approximately 6 hours ago, he treated his garden bed with pesticides against mice. He developed nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. The patient noted facial muscle twitching and developed a tonic-clonic seizure that lasted 3 minutes, 4 hours following the onset of his condition. His past medical history is insignificant for any seizure disorders, and he does not take any medications. His blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg, heart rate is 104/min, respiratory rate is 10/min, and the temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical examination, the patient\u2019s consciousness is decreased with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13. He is pale and sweaty. His lung sounds are normal, cardiac sounds are decreased, and no murmurs are present. Abdominal palpation reveals epigastric tenderness. Neurological examination shows rapid downbeating nystagmus, facial muscle twitching, and symmetrically decreased sensation to all the sensory modalities on both the upper and lower extremities. Further discussion reveals that the patient was using sodium fluoroacetate as a pesticide, which is known to form fluorocitrate in the cells of aerobic organisms. Which of the following substances will accumulate in the patient\u2019s cells?\nOptions:\nA. Fumarate\nB. Citrate\nC. Isocitrate\nD. Malate\nE. Succinate\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Citrate.\n\nSodium fluoroacetate is a toxic substance that inhibits the enzyme aconitase, which is involved in the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or tricarboxylic acid cycle). When sodium fluoroacetate is metabolized to fluorocitrate, it inhibits aconitase, leading to the accumulation of citrate in the cells. This is because aconitase is responsible for converting citrate to isocitrate, and when it is inhibited, citrate builds up.",

The cough is productive of small amounts of green phlegm. He has metastatic colon cancer and has received three cycles of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin; his last chemotherapy session was 2.5 months ago. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has been treated with antibiotics and prednisolone for acute exacerbations three times in the past year. His medications include a fluticasone-salmeterol inhaler and a tiotropium bromide inhaler. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 48 years. His temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (103.1\u00b0F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 88/69 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. Pulmonary examination shows diffuse crackles and rhonchi. An x-ray of the chest shows a left upper-lobe infiltrate of the lung. Two sets of blood cultures are obtained. Endotracheal aspirate Gram stain shows gram-negative rods. Two large bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluids are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?\nOptions:\nA. Ceftriaxone and azithromycin\nB. Ertapenem\nC. Colistin\nD. Cefepime and levofloxacin\nE. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Cefepime and levofloxacin.\n\nThe patient is presenting with severe pneumonia, likely caused by a gram-negative rod, as seen on the endotracheal aspirate Gram stain. The patient's history of metastatic colon cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and recent chemotherapy make him immunocompromised and at risk for severe infections.\n\nCefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin that has good coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common pathogen in immunocompromised patients. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone that also has good coverage against Pseudomonas and other gram-negative rods.\n\nOption A, ceftriaxone and azithromycin, is a good combination for community-acquired pneumonia, but may not provide adequate coverage against Pseudomonas.\n\nOption B, ertapenem, is a carbapenem that has good coverage against gram-negative rods, but may not be necessary in this case, and its use should be reserved for more severe infections or those caused by resistant pathogens.\n\nOption C, colistin, is a polymyxin that is often used as a last resort for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections, but is not a first-line agent.\n\nOption E, clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate, is not a suitable combination for this patient, as it does not provide adequate coverage against gram-negative rods.",

Schizoaffective disorder.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The patient has a 7-month history of psychotic symptoms (hearing voices), which is consistent with a psychotic disorder.\n* The patient also has a history of mood swings, characterized by periods of increased energy, decreased need for sleep, and impulsive behavior (online shopping), which is consistent with a mood disorder (bipolar disorder).\n* The patient's symptoms are not limited to a single episode, but rather have been ongoing for 7 months, which rules out brief psychotic disorder.\n* Schizoaffective disorder is a condition that combines symptoms of schizophrenia (psychotic symptoms) with symptoms of a mood disorder (bipolar disorder). This diagnosis is most consistent with the patient's presentation.\n* Schizophreniform disorder is a condition that is similar to schizophrenia, but the symptoms last for less than 6 months. Since the patient's symptoms have been ongoing for 7 months, this diagnosis is not a good fit.\n* Schizotypal personality disorder is a personality disorder that is characterized by eccentric behavior and thinking, but it does not typically involve psychotic symptoms or mood swings.",

The patient\u2019s son says he has difficulty remembering recent events and names. He says the patient\u2019s symptoms have progressively worsened over the last several years but became acutely worse just recently. Also, yesterday, the patient complained that he could not see out of his right eye, but today he can. When asked about these concerns, the patient seems to have no insight into the problem and reports feeling well. His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. He had a left basal ganglia hemorrhage 12 years ago and a right middle cerebral artery infarction 4 years ago. Current medications are amlodipine, aspirin, clopidogrel, metformin, sitagliptin, and valsartan. He lives with his son and can feed himself and change his clothes. There is no history of urinary or fecal incontinence. His vitals include: blood pressure 137/82 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented. He is unable to perform simple arithmetic calculations and the mini-mental status exam is inconclusive. He can write his name and comprehend written instructions. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side. The tone is also slightly reduced on the right side with exaggerated reflexes.

Normal-pressure hydrocephalus\nE. Vascular dementia\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Vascular dementia.\n\nThe patient's history of multiple strokes (left basal ganglia hemorrhage 12 years ago and right middle cerebral artery infarction 4 years ago) and the recent worsening of symptoms suggest a vascular etiology for his dementia. The patient's physical examination findings, including hemiparesis, reduced tone, and exaggerated reflexes on the right side, are consistent with a vascular dementia. The patient's lack of insight into his condition and his ability to perform some daily activities, such as feeding and dressing himself, also support this diagnosis.\n\nAlzheimer's disease (Option A) is less likely given the patient's history of strokes and the stepwise progression of his symptoms. Frontotemporal dementia (Option B) is also unlikely given the patient's lack of prominent behavioral changes and language deficits. Lewy body dementia (Option C) is possible, but the patient's history of strokes and the absence of prominent visual hallucinations make it less likely. Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (Option D) is unlikely given the patient's lack of urinary or fecal incontinence and the absence of other characteristic symptoms such as gait apraxia.",

Therefore, the next best step is to discontinue methimazole and start propylthiouracil to manage the patient's hyperthyroidism during pregnancy.",

The patient states that he has gradually worsening back pain that seems to have worsened after moving furniture the other day. He also states that while he walks, he feels numbness and weakness in his legs. The only time the patient states his back pain is improved is when he is riding his bike or pushing a cart at the grocery store. The patient has a past medical history of osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. He drinks 3 alcoholic drinks every day and has a 44 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 157/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a non-tender spine with normal mobility in all 4 directions. Radiography of the spine and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Compression fracture\nB. Herniated nucleus pulposus\nC. Musculoskeletal strain\nD. Spinal stenosis\nE. Vascular claudication\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Spinal stenosis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, particularly the worsening back pain and numbness/weakness in the legs while walking, are consistent with spinal stenosis. The fact that his back pain improves when he is riding a bike or pushing a cart at the grocery store (i.e., when he is in a flexed position) is also a classic feature of spinal stenosis. This is because flexion of the spine can increase the diameter of the spinal canal, temporarily relieving pressure on the nerves and alleviating symptoms.\n\nCompression fracture (A) is unlikely given the patient's lack of tenderness on physical exam and the gradual onset of symptoms. Herniated nucleus pulposus (B) is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a compressive lesion rather than a disc herniation. Musculoskeletal strain (C) is a possible diagnosis, but it does not fully explain the patient's symptoms, particularly the numbness and weakness in the legs. Vascular claudication (E) is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a neurological rather than a vascular etiology.",

Involvement of terminal ileum\nB. No rectal involvement\nC. Noncaseating granulomas\nD. Transmural inflammation\nE. Continuous mucosal damage\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Continuous mucosal damage.\n\nUlcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that primarily affects the mucosa of the colon. One of the hallmark features of ulcerative colitis is continuous mucosal damage, which means that the inflammation and ulceration of the mucosa are continuous and do not skip areas. This is in contrast to Crohn's disease, which is another type of IBD that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract and is characterized by skip lesions.\n\nThe other options are not consistent with ulcerative colitis:\n\nA. Involvement of the terminal ileum is more characteristic of Crohn's disease.\n\nB. No rectal involvement is unlikely in ulcerative colitis, as the rectum is typically involved in this condition.\n\nC. Noncaseating granulomas are more characteristic of Crohn's disease.\n\nD. Transmural inflammation is more characteristic of Crohn's disease, which can affect all layers of the bowel wall. Ulcerative colitis, on the other hand, is typically limited to the mucosa and submucosa.",

He has also been taking warfarin over the last 3 months after he suffered a deep venous thrombosis. After he was transported to the ED, his family found that the pills his grandson takes for seizures were missing. On presentation, he is found to be somnolent and physical exam reveals ataxia and nystagmus.

The father also noticed it was \u201cpretty cold\u201d in his son's apartment because all of the windows were left open overnight. He has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension for which he takes medication. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug. He appears lethargic. His rectal temperature is 32\u00b0C (89.6\u00b0F), pulse is 54/min, respirations are 8/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?\nOptions:\nA. Lisinopril\nB. Fluphenazine\nC. Tolbutamide\nD. Levothyroxine\nE. Atorvastatin\n\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Levothyroxine.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including altered mental status, lethargy, hypothermia, bradycardia, and decreased deep tendon reflexes, are consistent with an overdose of levothyroxine (T4), which is used to treat hypothyroidism. The recent initiation of this medication 10 days prior to presentation supports this diagnosis. The patient's attempt to remove his clothing, despite being hypothermic, is also consistent with a thyrotoxic crisis, which can cause altered mental status and inappropriate behavior.\n\nThe other options are not likely causes of the patient's symptoms:\n\nA. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor used to treat hypertension, and it is not typically associated with these symptoms.\n\nB. Fluphenazine is an antipsychotic medication used to treat schizoaffective disorder, but it is not typically associated with hypothermia, bradycardia, or decreased deep tendon reflexes.\n\nC. Tolbutamide is an oral hypoglycemic medication used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, but it is not typically associated with these symptoms.\n\nE.

She notices that the standard error surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups. Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants\nPulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants\nPlacebo: 395 participants\nTable 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value\nPlaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 \u00b1 2.8 1.2 \u00b1 4.7 15.8 \u00b1 2.9 < 0.01\nLDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 \u00b1 3.6 -11.2 \u00b1 14.3 -8.4 \u00b1 3.9 0.28\nFEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 \u00b1 2.21 0.34 \u00b1 5.54 -0.22 \u00b1 3.21 0.27\nACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 \u00b1 1.22 0.46 \u00b1 3.25 0.12 \u00b1 1.33 0.43\nConclusion:\nPulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.\nSource of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health\"\nOptions:\nA. It indicates an increased likelihood of bias\nB. It indicates decreased external validity\nC. It indicates a lack of statistical significance\nD. It reflects a smaller sample size\nE. It indicates more narrow confidence intervals\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. It reflects a smaller sample size.\n\nThe standard error is a measure of the variability of a sample statistic. A larger standard error indicates more variability in the sample, which can be due to a smaller sample size. In this case, the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group has a smaller sample size (202 participants) compared to the other two groups (388 and 395 participants, respectively). This smaller sample size is likely the reason for the larger standard errors in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group.",

The elevation of these enzymes indicates liver damage. The pattern of injury, with AST > ALT, suggests ischemic or hypoxic injury to the liver.\n\nCentrilobular hepatocytes are the cells most susceptible to ischemic injury due to their location in the centrilobular region of the liver, which is the area most distant from the hepatic artery and portal vein. This region is therefore most prone to hypoxia and ischemia.\n\nIn this patient, the likely cause of liver damage is hypoperfusion of the liver due to hypotension and shock from the severe gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's history of major depressive disorder and the mother's mention of a medication that resulted in only slight improvement in symptoms also support this diagnosis.\n\nWhile the other options are also antidepressants, they are less likely to cause QT prolongation:\n\n* Bupropion is a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor that is not typically associated with QT prolongation.\n* Sertraline is an SSRI, but it is less likely to cause QT prolongation compared to citalopram.\n* Venlafaxine is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that can cause QT prolongation, but it is less common than with citalopram.\n* Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that can cause QT prolongation, but it is an older medication that is less commonly used today.",

Sixty similar but healthy individuals are recruited into the control group. Educational status is considered to be an important variable, as it would affect the awareness of the disease and its risk factors among the participants. Based on the level of education, 2 groups are formed: low educational status and high educational status. A chi-square test is performed to test the significance of the relationship, and an odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9\u20139.7. What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?\nOptions:\nA. The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.\nB. The association is statistically significant, but low education is not a risk factor.\nC. The association is not statistically significant, but low education is a risk factor.\nD. One can not comment, as the p-value is not given.\nE. The association is statistically significant, and low education is a risk factor.\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. The association is not statistically significant, but low education is a risk factor.\n\nThe odds ratio of 2.1 suggests that there is a positive association between low educational status and the risk of MI, indicating that low education may be a risk factor. However, the confidence interval (0.9-9.7) includes 1, which means that the association is not statistically significant. If the confidence interval did not include 1, it would suggest that the association is statistically significant.",

His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm \u00d7 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/\u03bcL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm \u00d7 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/\u03bcL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?\nOptions:\nA. Stop antiretroviral therapy and continue antitubercular therapy\nB. Change antiretroviral therapy to darunavir/ritonavir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine\nC. Change antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol-streptomycin\nD. Change antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-ethambutol-streptomycin\nE. Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change.\n\nThe patient is experiencing a paradoxical reaction, also known as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), which is a common complication of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in patients with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) co-infection. IRIS occurs when the immune system recovers and responds to the presence of TB antigens, leading to an inflammatory response.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as fever, cough, and lymphadenopathy, are consistent with IRIS. The increase in CD4+ T cell count and decrease in HIV RNA levels suggest that the ART is effective. The negative sputum smear and normal Mantoux test suggest that the TB is under control.\n\nIn this scenario, the most appropriate initial step is to continue both antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any changes. IRIS is usually self-limiting and resolves with continued treatment. Corticosteroids may be considered in severe cases, but they are not necessary in this scenario.",

He states that he does not experience dysuria. On physical exam there is no costovertebral angle tenderness. With this presentation which is the most likely cause of this patient's hematuria?\nOptions:\nA. Bladder tumor\nB. Renal cell carcinoma\nC. Beeturia\nD. Urinary tract infection\nE. Urethral injury\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Bladder tumor.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of red-colored urine (hematuria) without dysuria (painful urination) or costovertebral angle tenderness (kidney pain) suggest a lower urinary tract source of bleeding, such as the bladder. Bladder tumors, particularly transitional cell carcinoma, are a common cause of painless hematuria in older adults.\n\nBeeturia (C) is a benign condition that causes urine to turn red or pink after eating beets, but it is not a likely cause of persistent hematuria.\n\nRenal cell carcinoma (B) can cause hematuria, but it is often accompanied by other symptoms such as flank pain, weight loss, and fatigue.\n\nUrinary tract infection (D) typically causes dysuria, frequency, and urgency, which are not present in this patient.\n\nUrethral injury (E) is unlikely to cause hematuria without other symptoms such as pain or difficulty urinating.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother with confusion, abdominal pain, and vomiting for the previous day. The patient\u2019s mother says he started complaining of pain in his abdomen after he got back from school yesterday and vomited 3 times during the night. This morning, he seemed confused so she rushed him to the ER. She has also noticed that he has been urinating frequently and drinking a lot of water recently, and he has lost 6 kg (13.2 lb) over the past 20 days. His vital signs include: blood pressure 100/50 mm Hg, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 27/min, and temperature 35.6\u00b0C (96.0\u00b0F). His BMI is 18 kg/m2. On physical examination, he is disoriented to time and place and is taking deep and labored breaths. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation in the abdomen with guarding. Laboratory tests are significant for a pH of 7.19 and a blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL. The doctor explains to his mother that her son has developed a life-threatening complication of a disease characterized by decreased levels of a hormone. Which of the following would you most likely expect to see in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes\nB. Decreased activity of hormone sensitive lipase\nC. Decreased proteolysis\nD. Increased lipoprotein lipase activity\nE. Decreased glucose uptake by brain cells\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes.\n\nThe patient is presenting with symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. The hormone that is deficient in diabetes mellitus is insulin. Insulin plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism, and its deficiency leads to decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes and other tissues. This results in hyperglycemia, which is evident in the patient's blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus or DKA:\n\nB. Decreased activity of hormone-sensitive lipase would actually increase glucose uptake by adipocytes, as hormone-sensitive lipase breaks down triglycerides to release fatty acids and glycerol.\n\nC. Decreased proteolysis would not be expected in DKA, as the body is breaking down protein to release amino acids for gluconeogenesis.\n\nD. Increased lipoprotein lipase activity would increase glucose uptake by adipocytes, as lipoprotein lipase breaks down triglycerides in lipoproteins to release fatty acids and glycerol.\n\nE. Decreased glucose uptake by brain cells is not a direct consequence of insulin deficiency, and the patient's confusion and disorientation are more likely due to the metabolic acidosis and electrolyte imbalance associated with DKA.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 58-year-old woman presents to the emergency department because of worsening abdominal pain for the past 2 days. She reports nausea and vomiting and is unable to tolerate oral intake. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.6\u00b0F), the pulse is 92/min, the respirations are 18/min, and the blood pressure is 132/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows yellowish discoloration of her sclera. Her abdomen is tender in the right upper quadrant. There is no abdominal distention or organomegaly. The laboratory tests show the following results:\nHemoglobin 13 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 16,000/mm3\nUrea nitrogen 25 mg/dL\nCreatinine 2 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase 432 U/L\nAlanine aminotransferase 196 U/L\nAspartate transaminase 207 U/L\nBilirubin  \nTotal 3.8 mg/dL\nDirect 2.7 mg/dL\nLipase 82 U/L\nUltrasound of the right upper quadrant shows dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder. The pancreas is not well visualized. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and metronidazole are initiated. After 12 hours, the patient appears acutely ill and is not oriented to time. Her temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.4\u00b0F), the pulse is 105/min, the respirations are 22/min, and the blood pressure is 112/82 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan\nB. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\nC. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy\nD. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)\nE. Percutaneous cholecystostomy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).\n\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of ascending cholangitis, which is a medical emergency. The patient has a fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice, and the ultrasound shows dilated bile ducts and gallstones. The patient's worsening condition over 12 hours, including altered mental status, suggests that the infection is progressing.\n\nERCP is the most appropriate next step in management because it allows for both diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. ERCP can be used to visualize the biliary tree, diagnose the cause of the obstruction, and perform therapeutic interventions such as sphincterotomy, stone extraction, and stent placement to relieve the obstruction and drain the infected bile.\n\nWhile abdominal CT scan (Option A) may provide additional information about the extent of the disease, it is not a therapeutic intervention and would not address the patient's immediate needs. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (Option C) is not indicated in this scenario, as the patient's primary problem is the infected bile duct, not the gallbladder. MRCP (Option D) is a diagnostic test that may provide additional information, but it would not provide therapeutic benefit. Percutaneous cholecystostomy (Option E) may be used to drain the gallbladder, but it would not address the underlying problem of the infected bile duct.",

He was recently kicked off of the school's football team after missing too many practices. He has also been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them, but he admits that he is lonely. He has not left his room for 2 days, which prompted his father to bring him to the physician. He has no medical conditions and does not take any medications. He does not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. While the father is in the waiting room, a mental status examination is conducted, which shows a constricted affect. Cognition is intact. He says that he would be better off dead and refuses to be treated.

She was in her normal excellent state of health prior to this event. Two weeks ago, she had an upper respiratory infection (URI) but has since recovered. Her father has chronic kidney disease (CKD), bilateral hearing loss, and vision problems. At the hospital, her temperature is 40.3\u00b0C (104.5\u00b0F), blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical exam, the patient appears to have altered mental status and her skin is dry, hot, and erythematous. She is complaining of severe bilateral flank pain and generalized myalgia. Catheterization produces 200 mL of tea-colored urine. Urine dipstick is positive for blood, but urinalysis is negative for RBCs or WBCs. Which of the following is most likely responsible for her condition?\nOptions:\nA. A mutation of the COL4A5 gene\nB. Neisseria meningitides\nC. Heat exhaustion\nD. Heat stroke\nE. IgA nephropathy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Heat stroke.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as altered mental status, dry, hot, and erythematous skin, and a high temperature (40.3\u00b0C or 104.5\u00b0F), are consistent with heat stroke. The presence of tea-colored urine and a positive urine dipstick for blood, but a negative urinalysis for RBCs or WBCs, suggests rhabdomyolysis, which is a common complication of heat stroke.\n\nHeat exhaustion (option C) is a milder heat-related illness that is characterized by a normal mental status and a lower body temperature.\n\nThe patient's family history of chronic kidney disease, bilateral hearing loss, and vision problems in her father suggests a possible genetic component, but it is not directly related to her current condition. Alport syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in the COL4A5 gene (option A), is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, ears, and eyes, but it is not typically associated with heat-related illnesses.\n\nNeisseria meningitides (option B) is a bacterium that can cause meningitis and sepsis, but it is not typically associated with heat-related illnesses or rhabdomyolysis.\n\nIgA nephropathy (option E) is a type of glomerulonephritis that can cause hematuria, but it is not typically associated with heat-related illnesses or rhabdomyolysis.",

He was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder 6 months ago, which is being treated with citalopram. He comments that his symptoms have improved since initiating the prescribed therapy; however, in the past 2 months, he has been unable to have sexual intercourse due to weak tumescence and low libido. His blood pressure is 122/74 mm Hg, heart rate is 75/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. What is the appropriate step in the management of this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Lowering citalopram dose\nB. Addition of bupropion\nC. Switch to fluoxetine\nD. Addition of sildenafil\nE. Switch to selegiline\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Addition of bupropion.\n\nThe patient is experiencing sexual side effects, specifically weak tumescence and low libido, which are common adverse effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like citalopram. Bupropion is an antidepressant that is known to have a lower risk of sexual side effects compared to SSRIs. Adding bupropion to the patient's regimen may help alleviate these symptoms.\n\nLowering the dose of citalopram (Option A) may not be effective in addressing the sexual side effects, and may even compromise the patient's anxiety symptoms. Switching to fluoxetine (Option C) is not a good option, as it is also an SSRI and may have similar sexual side effects. Adding sildenafil (Option D) may help with erectile dysfunction, but it does not address the underlying issue of low libido. Switching to selegiline (Option E) is not a good option, as it is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that has its own set of side effects and interactions.",

He developed severe, crushing, substernal chest pain 10 hours ago while he was hiking in the Adirondack mountains. He was with 2 friends at the time who gave him aspirin before carrying him 5 miles to a town to get phone service, where they then called emergency medical services. His past medical history is notable for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He takes enalapril, metformin, and atorvastatin. He has a 20-pack-year smoking history and is an avid hiker. His temperature is 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 102/60 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 28/min. He is diaphoretic and intermittently conscious. Bilateral rales are heard on pulmonary auscultation. An electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in leads I and aVL.

Posterior descending artery\nE. Right marginal artery\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Left circumflex artery.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and electrocardiogram (ECG) findings suggest an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) involving the lateral wall of the left ventricle. The ST elevations in leads I and aVL are consistent with a lateral wall MI. The autopsy findings of ischemia in the left atrium and posterior left ventricle further support this diagnosis.\n\nThe left circumflex artery is the most likely vessel affected in this patient because it supplies blood to the lateral wall of the left ventricle, including the posterior left ventricle and left atrium. The left circumflex artery is a branch of the left coronary artery and is responsible for perfusing the lateral and posterior aspects of the left ventricle.\n\nThe other options are not as likely:\n\nA. Left anterior descending artery: This artery supplies blood to the anterior wall of the left ventricle, not the lateral wall.\n\nC. Left coronary artery: While the left coronary artery is the parent vessel of the left circumflex artery, it is not the specific vessel affected in this patient.\n\nD.

MH is often triggered by certain medications, such as succinylcholine, or by other substances, such as alcohol or stimulants.\n\nDantrolene is a specific treatment for MH, and it is the best next step in management. It works by reducing the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which helps to relax muscle tone and reduce heat production.\n\nAcetaminophen (A) is not effective in treating MH, and it may even exacerbate the condition by increasing heat production. Diazepam (C) is a benzodiazepine that may help with muscle relaxation, but it is not a specific treatment for MH. Intubation (D) may be necessary to protect the patient's airway, but it is not the primary treatment for MH. Supportive therapy (E) is important, but it is not enough to treat MH, and dantrolene should be administered as soon as possible.",

The pain is exacerbated by jogging and climbing up stairs. He has no history of trauma to the knee. He is otherwise healthy. He is an active member of his school's gymnastics team. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right knee shows a tender swelling at the proximal tibia; range of motion is full. Knee extension against resistance causes pain in the anterior proximal tibia. The remainder of the examinations shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the right knee shows anterior tibial soft tissue swelling with fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\nOptions:\nA. Administration of oral ketorolac\nB. Perform joint aspiration\nC. Open reduction of the tuberosity\nD. Administration of oral methotrexate\nE. Application of a lower leg cast\n\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Administration of oral ketorolac.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and X-ray findings are consistent with Osgood-Schlatter disease, a common condition in adolescents that affects the tibial tuberosity. The condition is caused by repetitive strain on the patellar tendon, leading to inflammation and fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity.\n\nThe most appropriate next step is to administer oral ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), to reduce pain and inflammation. This is a conservative approach to manage the symptoms, and it is often effective in relieving pain and promoting healing.\n\nThe other options are not appropriate:\n\nB. Joint aspiration is not necessary, as the X-ray findings are consistent with Osgood-Schlatter disease, and there is no indication of infection or other conditions that would require aspiration.\n\nC. Open reduction of the tuberosity is not necessary, as the condition is typically managed conservatively with rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE) and NSAIDs.\n\nD. Administration of oral methotrexate is not indicated, as it is a medication used to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, and it is not effective in managing Osgood-Schlatter disease.\n\nE. Application of a lower leg cast is not necessary, as the condition does not require immobilization, and a cast would likely interfere with the patient's ability to participate in gymnastics.",

She has right-sided chest pain that increases on inspiration and has had a productive cough for the last 12 hours. She had an episode of hypotension after the operation that resolved with intravenous fluid therapy. She underwent an abdominal hysterectomy 16 years ago for multiple fibroids of the uterus. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 17 years. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg. Inspiratory crackles are heard at the right lung base. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There is a healing surgical incision below the right ribcage. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Pulmonary embolism\nB. Subphrenic abscess\nC. Pneumonia\nD. Atelectasis\nE. Pneumothorax\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Pneumonia.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as fever, chills, headache, and productive cough, are consistent with pneumonia. The presence of inspiratory crackles at the right lung base on physical examination also supports this diagnosis. The patient's recent surgery and episode of hypotension may have increased her risk of developing pneumonia. While pulmonary embolism (A) is a possible complication of surgery, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with pneumonia. Subphrenic abscess (B) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and the fact that the abdomen is soft and nontender. Atelectasis (D) may occur after surgery, but it is less likely to cause fever, chills, and productive cough. Pneumothorax (E) is also unlikely given the patient's symptoms and the absence of any signs of respiratory distress.",

The wide splitting of S2 and the loud second component of S2 best heard at the 2nd left intercostal space are characteristic of ASD. This is because the ASD allows oxygenated blood to flow from the left atrium to the right atrium, increasing the volume of blood flowing through the right ventricle and pulmonary valve, which causes the pulmonary component of S2 to be loud.\n\nIncreased left ventricular preload is the most likely cause of this patient's cardiac findings because the ASD allows excess blood to flow into the right atrium and ventricle, which then flows into the lungs, increasing the preload on the left ventricle.",

He also stated that he used to have \u2018high blood sugars\u2019 when checked in the hospital 4 years ago, but he did not follow up regarding this issue. He works as a farmer and noticed that it became much harder for him to work in the last few days because of fatigue and syncope. He has a 24-pack-year history of smoking and consumes alcohol occasionally. The vital signs include: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and temperature 36.5\u2103 (97.7\u2109). On physical examination, the patient is pale and acrocyanotic. There is a visible jugular vein distention and bilateral lower leg pitting edema. The pulmonary auscultation is significant for occasional bilateral wheezes.

She says that the accumulation of things in her kitchen and dining room makes regular use of these spaces incredibly difficult. Her behavior started when she was in high school. She feels anxious when she tries to discard her possessions and her husband tries to clean and organize the home. This behavior frustrates her because most of the items she saves have little emotional or monetary value. She reports that there has been no improvement despite attending cognitive behavioral therapy sessions for the past 6 months. She now feels that her behavior is \u201ctaking over\u201d her life. She does not drink, smoke, or use illicit drugs. She takes no medications. Her temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 116/80 mm Hg. On mental status examination, she is calm, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. Her mood is depressed; her speech is organized, logical, and coherent; and there are no psychotic symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Atomoxetine\nB. Fluoxetine\nC. Lamotrigine\nD. Buspirone\nE.

SSRIs have been found to reduce symptoms of hoarding, including difficulty discarding items and clutter.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the treatment of hoarding disorder:\n\nA. Atomoxetine is a medication used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nC. Lamotrigine is a mood stabilizer used to treat bipolar disorder.\n\nD. Buspirone is an anxiolytic medication used to treat anxiety disorders.\n\nE. Methylphenidate is a stimulant medication used to treat ADHD.\n\nIt's worth noting that the patient's depression may also be addressed with fluoxetine, as it is also an antidepressant medication.",

She reports a 3-month history of gradually worsening pain in her shoulders and hips that is worse in her right hip. She has a history of hypertension and recurrent renal stones for which she takes lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. She was admitted to the hospital earlier in the year after falling in her front yard and sustaining a distal radius fracture and vertebral compression fracture. Her temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 20/min. On exam, she is well-appearing with mild tenderness to palpation in her shoulders and hips. She has mild pain with hip flexion and shoulder abduction. She has full range of motion in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Serum findings are notable for the following:\n\nSerum:\nNa+: 141 mEq/L\nCl-: 100 mEq/L\nK+: 4.8 mEq/L\nHCO3-: 22 mEq/L\nUrea nitrogen: 17 mg/dL\nGlucose: 110 mg/dL\nCreatinine: 1.12 mg/dL\nCa2+: 11.2 mg/dL\nPhosphate: 2.3 mg/dL\nMg2+: 1.9 mg/dL\nAlkaline phosphatase: 120 U/L\n\nA radiograph of this patient\u2019s right hip would most likely reveal which of the following?\nOptions:\nA. Expansile lytic lesion with thin sclerotic margins\nB. Irregular blastic lesion\nC. Medullary bone destruction with elevated periosteum from cortical bone\nD. Poorly marginated lesion extending into adjacent soft tissue\nE. Well-defined cystic lesion with peritrabecular fibrosis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Irregular blastic lesion.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of Paget's disease of bone. The elevated alkaline phosphatase level and normal calcium and phosphate levels are consistent with this diagnosis. Paget's disease is a chronic bone disorder characterized by excessive bone resorption and formation, leading to irregularly shaped bones.\n\nA radiograph of the right hip would likely reveal an irregular blastic lesion, which is a characteristic feature of Paget's disease. The other options are not consistent with Paget's disease:\n\nA. Expansile lytic lesion with thin sclerotic margins is more consistent with a benign bone tumor, such as an aneurysmal bone cyst.\n\nC. Medullary bone destruction with elevated periosteum from cortical bone is more consistent with a malignant bone tumor, such as osteosarcoma.\n\nD. Poorly marginated lesion extending into adjacent soft tissue is more consistent with a malignant bone tumor, such as a metastasis.\n\nE. Well-defined cystic lesion with peritrabecular fibrosis is more consistent with a benign bone lesion, such as a simple bone cyst.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 20-year-old woman is brought in for a psychiatric consultation by her mother who is concerned because of her daughter\u2019s recent bizarre behavior. The patient\u2019s father died from lung cancer 1 week ago. Though this has been stressful for the whole family, the daughter has been hearing voices and having intrusive thoughts ever since. These voices have conversations about her and how she should have been the one to die and they encourage her to kill herself. She has not been able to concentrate at work or at school. She has no other history of medical or psychiatric illness. She denies recent use of any medication. Today, her heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, and temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F). On physical exam, she appears gaunt and anxious. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. CMP, CBC, and TSH are normal. A urine toxicology test is negative. What is the patient\u2019s most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Brief psychotic disorder\nB. Schizophreniform\nC. Adjustment disorder\nD. Schizophrenia\nE. Bereavement\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Brief psychotic disorder.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including hearing voices and having intrusive thoughts, are consistent with a psychotic episode. The fact that these symptoms started suddenly after a stressful event (her father's death) and have lasted for less than a month suggests a diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder. This diagnosis is characterized by a sudden onset of psychotic symptoms that last for at least 1 day but less than 1 month, and are often triggered by a stressful event.\n\nAdjustment disorder (option C) is not the correct diagnosis because it does not typically involve psychotic symptoms. Schizophreniform disorder (option B) is a possibility, but it requires that the symptoms last for at least 1 month but less than 6 months. Schizophrenia (option D) is also a possibility, but it typically involves a more chronic course of symptoms. Bereavement (option E) is a normal response to the loss of a loved one and does not typically involve psychotic symptoms.",

She was in her aerobics class when the pain started but denies any trauma to the region. She has a history of recurrent ovarian cysts. Menses occur regularly at 28-day intervals. Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (99.3\u00b0F). Abdominal examination shows tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding. Pelvic ultrasound shows a large simple cyst on the right ovary. Right ovarian artery flow is detectable on Doppler, but there is no flow detected in the right ovarian vein. Which of the following ligaments is most likely to have been involved?\nOptions:\nA. Broad ligament\nB. Round ligament of the uterus\nC. Ovarian ligament\nD. Cardinal ligament\nE. Infundibulopelvic ligament\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Infundibulopelvic ligament.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings suggest ovarian torsion, which is a twisting of the ovary that can cut off blood flow to the ovary. The infundibulopelvic ligament is a ligament that suspends the ovary and contains the ovarian vessels. Torsion of the ovary typically occurs when the ovary twists around the infundibulopelvic ligament, which can cause occlusion of the ovarian vessels and lead to ischemia or infarction of the ovary.",

As a member of a research team working on the Hib vaccine, he asks his senior colleague why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers like tetanus toxoid during vaccine development. Which of the following is the best response to this question?\nOptions:\nA. Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgG2 dominant antibody responses\nB. Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgM dominant antibody responses\nC. Polysaccharides conjugated with proteins are T cell-independent antigens\nD. Conjugation with a protein carrier improves vaccine stability\nE. Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgG2 dominant antibody responses.\n\nCapsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers like tetanus toxoid during vaccine development because it converts a T-cell independent antigen into a T-cell dependent antigen. This allows for the activation of T-cells, which is important for the development of immunological memory and the production of IgG antibodies, particularly IgG2. This is especially important for infants, who are unable to mount an effective immune response to polysaccharide antigens alone. Conjugation with a protein carrier enables the development of a more robust and long-lasting immune response.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: An investigator is studying the pattern of glutamate release from presynaptic nerve terminals in human volunteers with Alzheimer disease. The concentration of glutamate in the CA1 region of the hippocampus is measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy after Schaffer collateral fibers are electrically stimulated. Which of the following events most likely occurs immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters?\nOptions:\nA. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors\nB. Synthesis of glutamine\nC. Accumulation of cAMP\nD. Opening of ligand-gated ion channels\nE. Influx of calcium\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Influx of calcium.\n\nHere's why:\n\nThe question describes an experiment where the investigator is studying the release of glutamate from presynaptic nerve terminals in response to electrical stimulation of Schaffer collateral fibers. This is a classic scenario for studying neurotransmitter release.\n\nThe correct answer is E. Influx of calcium because calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels is the event that immediately precedes the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic terminal. When an action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, voltage-gated calcium channels open, allowing calcium ions to flow into the terminal. This increase in intracellular calcium concentration triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, releasing the neurotransmitter (in this case, glutamate) into the synaptic cleft.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors is a postsynaptic event that occurs after neurotransmitter release.\n\nB. Synthesis of glutamine is not directly related to the release of glutamate from presynaptic terminals.\n\nC. Accumulation of cAMP is a second messenger pathway that can be involved in synaptic plasticity, but it is not directly involved in the release of neurotransmitters.\n\nD. Opening of ligand-gated ion channels is a postsynaptic event that occurs after neurotransmitter release and binding to receptors.",

She was told by her friend that she need to see a physician because she needs to be treated as well, even if she is not having symptoms yet. She currently denies any headaches, vision changes, nausea or vomiting, or neck stiffness. Her physical exam is within normal limits. Her vital signs are stable. She is prescribed rifampin for prophylaxis with specific instructions on when to follow up if symptoms develop. When asked about the possibility of pregnancy, she mentioned that she uses combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for contraception. The physician suggested that her husband should use condoms for contraception as she requires antibiotic therapy. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the need for additional contraception?\nOptions:\nA. Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens.\nB. Rifampin inhibits CYP3A4, which metabolizes progestins.\nC. Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of progestins.\nD. Rifampin directly interferes with intestinal absorption of estrogens.\nE. Rifampin directly interferes with intestinal absorption of progestins.\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens.\n\nRifampin, an antibiotic, can induce the metabolism of estrogen, leading to decreased levels of estrogen in the body. This is because rifampin increases the activity of certain enzymes in the liver that break down estrogen. Additionally, rifampin can alter the normal gastrointestinal flora, which can lead to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens. The enterohepatic circulation is a process by which estrogens are reabsorbed from the gut back into the bloodstream, allowing for a longer duration of action. By disrupting this process, rifampin can reduce the effectiveness of combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), which contain estrogen. Therefore, the physician recommends additional contraception, such as condoms, to prevent unintended pregnancy.",

Mortality was studied in relation to age, sex, diagnosis, care pattern, and registration interval. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, with the overall SMR being 1.63 (lower when compared with studies that looked at hospitalized individuals). Men and those in younger age groups showed higher mortality rates (SMRs of 2.24 and 8.82, respectively), and mortality was also higher in the first year following registration (SMR = 2.32). Higher mortality was also found in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol and drug dependence (SMR = 3.87).

If the screen remains negative, she should receive anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks to prevent sensitization during the remainder of the pregnancy. Additionally, she should receive anti-D immunoglobulin after delivery if the newborn is Rh-positive. This will prevent sensitization and reduce the risk of hemolytic disease in future pregnancies.",

Occasionally, he experiences palpitations, especially during strenuous activities. In addition to this, he has been experiencing difficulty in digestion and often experiences regurgitation and dysphagia. He reports that he emigrated from Mexico 20 years ago and visits his hometown twice a year. The vital signs include: blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg, respiratory rate 19/min, and pulse 100/min. The physical examination shows jugular vein distention along with pitting edema in the ankles. Bilateral basilar crackles and an S3 gallop are heard on auscultation of the chest.

Chagas disease can cause chronic heart failure, which would explain the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Alcohol abuse (A) may cause cardiomyopathy, but it would not explain the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms. Hypertensive changes (B) may cause heart failure, but the patient's blood pressure is normal. Myocardial infarction (D) would likely cause ECG changes, which are not present in this patient. Bacterial infection (E) would not explain the patient's chronic symptoms and physical examination findings.",

These episodes last for approximately 25 minutes and are accompanied by his neck rotating to the right. During the last episode, he was able to relieve the stiffness by lightly touching his jaw. He has received six doses of haloperidol for auditory hallucinations since his admission. He appears anxious. His temperature is 37.3\u00b0C (99.1\u00b0F), pulse is 108/min, and blood pressure is 128/86 mm Hg. Examination shows a flexed neck rotated to the right.

He is extremely lethargic and is unable to provide an adequate history to his physician. His wife noted that roughly 3 days ago, her husband mentioned that something bit him, but she cannot remember what exactly. The vital signs include blood pressure 85/67 mm Hg, pulse rate 107/min, and respiratory rate 35/min. Upon examination, the man is currently afebrile but is lethargic and pale. His spleen is surgically absent. There are some swollen bite marks on his right hand with red streaks extending to his elbow. Which of the following bites would be most concerning in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Cat bite\nB. Human bite\nC. Spider bite\nD. Fish bite\nE. Dog bite\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Spider bite.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and lethargy, are concerning for sepsis. The presence of swollen bite marks on his right hand with red streaks extending to his elbow suggests a necrotic lesion, which is consistent with a brown recluse spider bite. The fact that the patient has a history of sickle cell disease and is asplenic (surgically absent spleen) makes him more susceptible to severe infections, including those caused by spider bites. Brown recluse spider bites can cause necrotic lesions and can lead to severe systemic illness, including sepsis, in immunocompromised individuals.",

Her previous births have been via uncomplicated caesarean sections, but she wishes to attempt vaginal delivery this time. Her prenatal care is notable for gestational diabetes controlled with diet and exercise. The delivery is prolonged, but the patient's pain is controlled with epidural analgesia. She delivers a male infant with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Fundal massage is performed, but the placenta does not pass. The obstetrician manually removes the placenta, but a red mass protrudes through the vagina attached to the placenta. The patient loses 500 mL of blood over the next minute, during which her blood pressure decreases from 120/80 mmHg to 90/65 mmHg. What is the best next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Uterine artery ligation\nB. Hysterectomy\nC. Intravenous oxytocin\nD. Elevate posterior fornix\nE. Red blood cell transfusion\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Elevate posterior fornix.\n\nThe scenario describes a case of placenta accreta, a condition where the placenta abnormally adheres to the uterine wall. The red mass protruding through the vagina attached to the placenta is likely a portion of the placenta that has invaded the uterine wall. The patient is experiencing significant bleeding and hypotension.\n\nElevating the posterior fornix (the upper part of the vagina) can help to compress the bleeding vessels and temporarily control the hemorrhage. This is a temporary measure to stabilize the patient before further interventions.\n\nUterine artery ligation (A) may be considered in some cases of placenta accreta, but it is not the best next step in this scenario. Hysterectomy (B) may ultimately be necessary, but it is not the immediate next step. Intravenous oxytocin (C) is not indicated in this situation, as it can exacerbate bleeding. Red blood cell transfusion (E) may be necessary, but it is not the best next step in managing the bleeding.",

He recently moved to the area and has not been to a primary care physician for over 5 years. He has no history of serious illness, but has intermittent bilateral knee pain for which he takes 650 mg acetaminophen every other day. He is married with three children and is sexually active with his wife. During the past 10 years, he has unsuccessfully tried to lose weight. He has smoked one half pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. About 2\u20133 times per week he has 1\u20132 glasses of wine with dinner.

Autoimmune liver damage: The patient's antinuclear antibody titers are only 1:20, which is not strongly suggestive of autoimmune liver disease. The smooth muscle antibody and anti-LKM1 antibody titers are negative, making autoimmune liver disease less likely.\n\nB. Congestive hepatopathy: There is no evidence of congestive heart failure or liver congestion in the patient's history or physical examination.\n\nD. Acetaminophen use: The patient's acetaminophen use is intermittent and not excessive, making it unlikely to cause the liver abnormalities.\n\nE. Alcohol use: The patient's alcohol use is moderate (1-2 glasses of wine 2-3 times a week), which is not sufficient to cause the liver abnormalities.",

He adds that he is fatigued all the time and has generalized weakness. He has drenching night sweats and has had 2 episodes of non-bilious vomiting over the past few days. He traveled to the Netherlands for 4 days a month ago. His symptoms started a few days after he returned home. Laboratory testing revealed the following:\nHemoglobin 11.2 g/dL\nHematocrit 29%\nLeukocyte count 2,950/mm3\nNeutrophils  59%\nBands  3%\nEosinophils 1%\nBasophils  0%\nLymphocytes 31%\nMonocytes  4%\nPlatelet count  60,000/mm3\nUnconjugated bilirubin 12 mg/dL\nAlanine aminotransferase 200 IU/L\nAspartate aminotransferase 355 IU/L\nThe peripheral blood smear showed basophilic ring- and pear-shaped structures inside many red cells and extracellular basophilic rings on Wright-Giemsa staining. Further evaluation revealed parasitemia and a few schistocytes, poikilocytes, and merozoites in tetrad formation. The findings are most consistent with which diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Malaria\nB. Babesiosis\nC. Anaplasmosis\nD. Tuberculosis\nE. Lyme disease\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Babesiosis.\n\nThe symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with Babesiosis, a tick-borne parasitic infection caused by Babesia microti. The presence of basophilic ring- and pear-shaped structures inside many red cells and extracellular basophilic rings on Wright-Giemsa staining, as well as the presence of parasitemia, schistocytes, poikilocytes, and merozoites in tetrad formation, are characteristic of Babesiosis.\n\nMalaria (Option A) can also cause parasitemia and abnormal red blood cell morphology, but the presence of tetrad formation and the specific morphology of the parasites are more consistent with Babesiosis.\n\nAnaplasmosis (Option C) is a tick-borne disease that can cause fever, chills, and hematological abnormalities, but it does not typically cause parasitemia or the specific red blood cell morphology seen in this case.\n\nTuberculosis (Option D) is a bacterial infection that can cause fever, chills, and hematological abnormalities, but it is not typically associated with parasitemia or the specific red blood cell morphology seen in this case.\n\nLyme disease (Option E) is a tick-borne disease that can cause fever, chills, and hematological abnormalities, but it is not typically associated with parasitemia or the specific red blood cell morphology seen in this case.",

About 10 days ago, she had an episode of unexplained loss of consciousness. Past medical history is negative and family history is irrelevant. Clinical examination shows a diastolic murmur, which is prominent when she lies on her left side. Jugular venous distention is present, and chest examination reveals fine crackles that do not clear with coughing. Chest X-ray shows pulmonary congestion, and 2-dimensional echocardiogram shows a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Rheumatic fever\nB. Innocent murmur\nC. Subacute infective endocarditis\nD. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis\nE. Atrial myxoma\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Atrial myxoma.\n\nThe symptoms and physical examination findings, such as shortness of breath, diastolic murmur, jugular venous distention, and pulmonary congestion, are consistent with a cardiac condition. The 2-dimensional echocardiogram showing a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum is a key finding that points to atrial myxoma, a type of benign tumor that can occur in the heart. The fact that the symptoms worsen when the patient lies on her left side is also consistent with atrial myxoma, as the tumor can obstruct the mitral valve and cause symptoms when the patient is in a certain position.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the symptoms and physical examination findings. Rheumatic fever (A) is a condition that typically occurs in children and is characterized by a rash, arthritis, and carditis. Innocent murmur (B) is a benign heart murmur that is not associated with any symptoms or cardiac conditions. Subacute infective endocarditis (C) is a bacterial infection of the heart valves, which is not consistent with the echocardiogram findings. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (D) is a condition characterized by the formation of blood clots on the heart valves, which is not consistent with the symptoms and echocardiogram findings.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 67-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for urinary incontinence. She has been waking up every morning with her underwear soaked in urine. She notices that at work if she does not take regular bathroom breaks her underwear will have some urine in it. She urinates 5 to 11 times per day but she claims it is a small volume. Her current medications include lisinopril, metformin, insulin, aspirin, atorvastatin, sodium docusate, and loratadine. Her temperature is 98.2\u00b0F (36.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 167/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities and a systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Bethanechol and intermittent straight catheterization\nB. Bethanechol during the day and oxybutynin at night\nC. No recommendations needed\nD. Oxybutynin and scheduled bathroom breaks\nE. Reduce fluid intake and discontinue diuretics\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Bethanechol and intermittent straight catheterization.\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggest overflow incontinence, which is characterized by frequent urination of small volumes, nocturia, and incontinence. The physical exam findings of decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities suggest diabetic neuropathy, which can cause neurogenic bladder dysfunction. The patient's medications, including lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor), may also contribute to her incontinence.\n\nBethanechol is a cholinergic agonist that can help stimulate bladder contraction and improve urinary emptying. Intermittent straight catheterization can help drain the bladder and prevent overflow incontinence. This combination is the best treatment option for this patient.\n\nOption B is incorrect because oxybutynin is an anticholinergic medication that can worsen urinary retention and overflow incontinence. Option C is incorrect because the patient's symptoms require treatment. Option D is incorrect because oxybutynin is not the best medication for this patient, and scheduled bathroom breaks may not be sufficient to manage her symptoms. Option E is incorrect because reducing fluid intake may not address the underlying cause of her incontinence, and discontinuing diuretics may not be necessary or effective in this case.",

They are concerned that she becomes lethargic and irritated between meals. They found that feeding her often with small servings helps. She was born at 39 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is meeting all developmental milestones. Her mother has one brother that occasionally requires blood transfusions. Today, her blood pressure is 55/33 mm Hg, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, and temperature of 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical exam, the infant is irritated. She is slightly jaundiced. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her blood work shows normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin. Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies are also ruled out. A Coombs test is negative. Red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal. The physician determined that these findings are related to an enzyme deficiency. Which of the following allosterically inhibits this enzyme?\nOptions:\nA. Alanine\nB. Adenosine diphosphate\nC. Adenosine monophosphate\nD. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate\nE. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Adenosine monophosphate.\n\nThe symptoms described in the question, such as lethargy and irritability between meals, are consistent with hypoglycemia. The laboratory results, including normocytic anemia, elevated reticulocyte count, and decreased haptoglobin, suggest a diagnosis of pyruvate kinase deficiency, a rare genetic disorder that affects the enzyme pyruvate kinase.\n\nPyruvate kinase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is an allosteric inhibitor of pyruvate kinase, meaning that it binds to the enzyme and reduces its activity. This is a negative feedback mechanism that helps regulate glycolysis and prevent excessive glucose breakdown.",

The patient\u2019s parents say he was doing well until a few weeks ago at which time he started to complain of daily abdominal cramps and occasional muscle pains. His mother also noticed that he has been less active than usual. The parents deny any complaints of headaches or convulsions. The family lives together in a house built in 1950. The patient\u2019s temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg, pulse is 100/min and respirations are 20/min.

She has had intermittent myalgias, arthralgias, fatigue, and skin rashes over the past 10 years that have acutely worsened over the past year. She works as a school teacher but reports that she has had to miss several days of work due to her symptoms. She has been on hydroxychloroquine for several years but does not feel that it is adequately controlling her symptoms. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her temperature is 99.2\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, she is well-appearing and in no acute distress. She has erythematous, raised plaques with keratotic scaling and follicular plugging on her hands. The physician decides to trial the patient on low-dose prednisone to better control her symptoms. At 2 months of follow-up, she reports that her flares have subsided and she has been able to return to work full-time. If this patient continues this medication regimen, she will be at an elevated risk for developing which of the following?\nOptions:\nA. Femoral neck fracture\nB. Femoral shaft fracture\nC. Meniscal tear\nD. Osgood-Schlatter disease\nE. Proximal phalanx fracture\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Femoral neck fracture.\n\nThe patient is taking low-dose prednisone to control her symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Long-term use of corticosteroids like prednisone can lead to osteoporosis, which increases the risk of fractures, particularly in the spine, hip, and wrist. The femoral neck is a common site for osteoporotic fractures, making option A the correct answer.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the use of prednisone or osteoporosis:\n\n* B. Femoral shaft fracture is not typically associated with osteoporosis or corticosteroid use.\n* C. Meniscal tear is a type of knee injury, not related to prednisone use or osteoporosis.\n* D. Osgood-Schlatter disease is a condition that affects the knee in adolescents, not related to prednisone use or osteoporosis.\n* E. Proximal phalanx fracture is a type of hand fracture, not typically associated with osteoporosis or corticosteroid use.",

Ask the son to step out so you can speak with the patient alone.\n\nBefore proceeding with any further evaluation or discussion, it's essential to establish a rapport with the patient and assess her ability to provide her own history and make decisions. By asking the son to step out, the doctor can create a safe and non-intimidating environment for the patient to open up and share her concerns, feelings, and experiences. This will help the doctor to better understand the patient's perspective and make a more accurate assessment of her cognitive and emotional state.",

A healthy subject is asked to eat a meal at hour 0, and the pH of stomach contents and rate of stomach acid secretions are measured over the next 4 hours. Results of the study are shown. Which of the following mechanisms most likely contributes to the changes seen at point D in the graph?\nOptions:\nA. Increased vagal stimulation\nB. Increased activity of D cells\nC. Increased activation of H2 receptors\nD. Increased activity of enterochromaffin-like cells\nE. Increased activity of I cells\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Increased activity of D cells.\n\nAt point D in the graph, the pH of the stomach contents increases, and the rate of stomach acid secretion decreases. This suggests that there is an inhibition of gastric acid secretion.\n\nD cells produce somatostatin, a hormone that inhibits the release of gastrin and other gastrointestinal hormones, including histamine and acetylcholine, which stimulate gastric acid secretion. Therefore, increased activity of D cells would lead to a decrease in gastric acid secretion and an increase in pH, as seen at point D.\n\nThe other options do not fit with the changes seen at point D:\n\nA. Increased vagal stimulation would increase gastric acid secretion, not decrease it.\n\nC. Increased activation of H2 receptors would increase gastric acid secretion, not decrease it.\n\nD. Increased activity of enterochromaffin-like cells would increase histamine release, which would stimulate gastric acid secretion, not decrease it.\n\nE.

There is no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Thyroid functions tests are within the reference range. Ultrasound of the neck shows an irregular, hypoechogenic mass in the left lobe of the thyroid. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is inconclusive.

She has no complaints and her past medical history is notable for diabetes and hypertension. During this visit, the patient undergoes screening procedures per guidelines including a mammogram. On the screening mammogram a spiculated, irregular mass is found on the left breast. Further diagnostic mammography and biopsy reveal ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Which of the following is the most important factor in determining this patient\u2019s prognosis?\nOptions:\nA. Tumor grade\nB. Tumor stage\nC. Age\nD. History of diabetes\nE. Location of the tumor on the breast\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Tumor stage.\n\nThe prognosis of breast cancer is most closely related to the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis. The stage of breast cancer is determined by the size of the tumor, the involvement of lymph nodes, and the presence of distant metastases. The TNM staging system is commonly used to classify breast cancer into different stages, with stage I being the earliest and most treatable, and stage IV being the most advanced and having the poorest prognosis.\n\nWhile tumor grade (option A) is also an important factor in determining prognosis, it is not as important as tumor stage. Tumor grade refers to the degree of abnormality of the cancer cells and how quickly they are growing. A higher grade tumor tends to have a poorer prognosis, but it is not as strong a predictor of outcome as tumor stage.\n\nAge (option C) is also a factor in breast cancer prognosis, with older women tend to have a poorer prognosis than younger women. However, it is not as important as tumor stage.\n\nThe patient's history of diabetes (option D) is not directly related to her breast cancer prognosis.\n\nThe location of the tumor on the breast (option E) is also not a significant factor in determining prognosis. While tumors in certain locations, such as the upper outer quadrant, may be more easily detected and treated, the prognosis is ultimately determined by the stage and characteristics of the tumor itself.",

He states that ever since her uncomplicated delivery she has failed to gain weight, has had chronic diarrhea, and has had multiple bacterial and viral infections. During the course of the workup, an absent thymic shadow is noted and a lymph node biopsy demonstrates the absence of germinal centers.

The absence of a thymic shadow and the lack of germinal centers in the lymph node biopsy further support this diagnosis.\n\nAdenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is a type of SCID that is caused by a defect in the ADA gene. This enzyme is necessary for the breakdown of toxic metabolites in lymphocytes, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of these metabolites, which are toxic to lymphocytes. As a result, patients with ADA deficiency have a severe deficiency of both B and T cells, leading to recurrent infections and failure to thrive.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Defect in WASP gene: This would cause Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a condition characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections, but not SCID.\n\nB.

She has no specific complaints at this visit however, she has noticed that she is more tired than usual these days. At first, she ignored it and attributed it to stress but she feels weaker each week. She is sometimes out of breath while walking for long distances or when she is involved in strenuous physical activity. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 3 years ago and has since been on medication to assist with her pain and to slow down disease progression. Her temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), the respiratory rate is 15/min, the pulse is 107/min, and the blood pressure is 102/98 mm Hg. On examination, you notice thinning hair and mildly cool extremities with flattened nail beds. A complete blood count and iron studies are ordered. Which of the following is most likely to show up on her iron profile?\nOptions:\nA. Increased iron-binding capacity\nB. Low ferritin levels\nC. Increased iron levels\nD. Decreased iron-binding capacity\nE. Normal iron-binding capacity\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Increased iron-binding capacity.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath suggest anemia, which is a common complication of rheumatoid arthritis. The physical examination findings of thinning hair, cool extremities, and flattened nail beds also support this diagnosis.\n\nIn iron deficiency anemia, the iron profile would typically show:\n\n* Low ferritin levels (not an option in this case)\n* Increased iron-binding capacity (transferrin saturation), as the body tries to increase iron absorption to compensate for the deficiency\n* Decreased iron levels (not an option in this case)\n\nIncreased iron levels (option C) would not be expected in iron deficiency anemia. Decreased iron-binding capacity (option D) is also not a characteristic of iron deficiency anemia. Normal iron-binding capacity (option E) would not be consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.",

She had similar episodes in the past, which were often precipitated by food but resolved spontaneously. Her temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (101.0\u00b0F), heart rate is 96/min, blood pressure is 118/76 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 16/min. Physical examination reveals tenderness over the right upper quadrant that is severe enough to make her stop breathing when deeply palpated in the area. Lab results show:\nLeukocyte count 18,000/mm3 with 79% neutrophils\nAspartate aminotransferase 67 IU/L\nAlanine aminotransferase 71 IU/L\nSerum amylase 46 U/L\nSerum Lipase 55 U/L\nSerum calcium 8.9 mg/dL\nUltrasonography of the abdomen is shown below. During the ultrasound exam, the patient complains of tenderness when the probe presses down on her right upper quadrant. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her pain?\nOptions:\nA. Acute calculous cholecystitis\nB. Acute acalculous cholecystitis\nC. Biliary colic\nD. Acute pancreatitis\nE. Ascending cholangitis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Acute calculous cholecystitis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, physical examination, and lab results are consistent with acute calculous cholecystitis. The presence of right upper quadrant tenderness, especially when the probe presses down on the area during ultrasound examination (Murphy's sign), is a classic finding in acute cholecystitis. The ultrasound image shows a gallstone in the gallbladder, which is the likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The elevated white blood cell count and mild elevation of liver enzymes also support this diagnosis.\n\nAcute acalculous cholecystitis (option B) is a less common condition that occurs in the absence of gallstones, often in critically ill patients. Biliary colic (option C) is a condition characterized by intermittent pain due to gallstone movement, but it does not typically present with fever, leukocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes. Acute pancreatitis (option D) is unlikely given the normal serum amylase and lipase levels. Ascending cholangitis (option E) is a bacterial infection of the biliary tract that typically presents with Charcot's triad (jaundice, fever, and right upper quadrant pain), which is not seen in this patient.",

Muellerian agenesis.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The patient has normal breast development and pubic hair, indicating normal estrogen levels, which is supported by the normal estradiol level.\n* The FSH level is within the normal range, which suggests that the ovaries are functioning normally.\n* The presence of axillary hair and normal testosterone level rule out androgen insensitivity syndrome.\n* The patient's height is relatively short, but it's not a characteristic feature of Turner syndrome, which is typically associated with short stature, webbed neck, and other physical abnormalities.\n* The patient's symptoms of mild intermittent lower abdominal pain for the past year suggest a possible anatomical abnormality.\n* The patient's refusal to undergo a vaginal examination and the presence of normal hormone levels point towards a structural abnormality, such as Muellerian agenesis, which is a congenital absence of the uterus and vagina.\n\nPrimary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is unlikely given the normal FSH and estradiol levels. Hyperprolactinemia is also unlikely as it would typically cause galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and low estrogen levels, which are not present in this patient.",

He says that he has episodes where he feels his heart is \u2018racing and pounding\u2019, lasting 1\u20132 hours on average. Initially, he says the episodes would happen 1\u20132 times per week but now happen almost every day. This last episode has been constant for the past 2 days. He denies any seizure, loss of consciousness, dizziness, chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is significant for an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, status post intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with still some residual neurologic impairment, and long-standing gastroesophageal reflux secondary to a hiatal hernia, managed medically. The patient reports a 15-pack-year smoking history, but no alcohol or recreational drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. On physical examination, muscle strength in the lower extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right, along with sensory loss on the left, all of which is improved from his previous exam 3 weeks ago. There is a loss of the left half of the visual field bilaterally which is stable from the previous exam. Cardiac examination is significant for a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm. No rubs, thrills or murmurs. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan shows evidence of an area of infarction in the vicinity of the right anterior cerebral artery showing normal interval change with no evidence of new hemorrhage or expansion of the area of infarction. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed, which is shown in the exhibit (see image below). Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Begin aspirin therapy\nB. Begin clopidogrel\nC. Carotid endarterectomy\nD. Begin warfarin and heparin\nE. Begin warfarin\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Begin warfarin and heparin.\n\nThe patient's ECG shows atrial fibrillation (AFib) with a rapid ventricular response, which is the cause of his palpitations. Given his history of ischemic stroke, AFib is a significant risk factor for future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). The most appropriate intervention to prevent future CVAs in this patient is to start anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and heparin. Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant that takes several days to reach therapeutic levels, so heparin is used as a bridge to prevent thrombus formation until warfarin takes effect.\n\nAspirin (Option A) is not sufficient for stroke prevention in AFib, and clopidogrel (Option B) is an antiplatelet agent that is not effective for stroke prevention in AFib. Carotid endarterectomy (Option C) is not relevant to this patient's condition, as there is no evidence of carotid artery stenosis. Starting warfarin alone (Option E) would not provide immediate protection against thrombus formation, and heparin is necessary as a bridge until warfarin takes effect.",

To test this hypothesis, they reviewed a database of women who were known to be BRCA-mutation positive and divided the group into those with breast cancer and those without breast cancer. They used data in the registry and surveys about peoples\u2019 surgical history to compare the proportion of each population that had undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Based on this data, they reported that women undergoing the procedure had a lower chance of developing breast cancer later in life with an odds ratio of 0.46. This is an example of what type of study design?\nOptions:\nA. Retrospective cohort\nB. Meta-analysis\nC. Cross-sectional\nD. Case-control\nE. Genome-wide association study\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D.

Retrospective cohort: This type of study would follow a group of people over time to see if they develop a particular outcome. In this study, the outcome (breast cancer) has already occurred, and the researchers are looking back at the history of the individuals to see if they had undergone the procedure.\n\nB. Meta-analysis: This type of study combines the results of multiple studies to draw a conclusion. This study is a single study that analyzed a database of women with BRCA mutations.\n\nC.

Lamellated calcification\nB. \u2018Popcorn\u2019 pattern\nC. Subsolid component\nD. Extending fine striations\nE. Doubling time of < 1 month\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Doubling time of < 1 month.\n\nThe presence of a pulmonary nodule in a patient with prostate cancer raises concerns about potential metastasis. The decision to remove a pulmonary nodule depends on various factors, including its size, growth rate, and radiological features.\n\nA doubling time of < 1 month is a strong indicator of malignancy, as it suggests rapid growth.

He is worried that his health has suffered because of this, and he is also concerned that he will not be able to pay his bills if he were to get sick. He has no past medical or psychiatric condition and is not known to use any recreational drugs. The patient arrived for his appointment an hour early because he was afraid he might miss it. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals an irritable middle age man who is tense and somewhat inattentive during the interview. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?\n \nOptions:\nA. Generalized anxiety disorder\nB. Adjustment disorder\nC. Social anxiety \nD. Agoraphobia\nE. Normal worry\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Generalized anxiety disorder.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as insomnia, excessive worry about his health and finances, and anxiety about being late for his appointment, are consistent with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The patient's physical examination findings, such as being irritable, tense, and inattentive, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's long-standing history of insomnia and worry about his health suggests a chronic anxiety disorder, which is consistent with GAD.\n\nAdjustment disorder (option B) is not the most likely diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms are not in response to a specific stressor or event. Social anxiety disorder (option C) is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are not primarily related to social situations. Agoraphobia (option D) is not supported by the patient's symptoms, as there is no mention of fear or avoidance of specific situations or places. Normal worry (option E) is not a diagnosis, and the patient's symptoms are excessive and interfere with his daily life, indicating a pathological level of anxiety.",

The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A complete blood count is normal.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia\nB. Hemophilia B\nC. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura\nD. Von Willebrand disease\nE. Hemophilia A\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Hemophilia A.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of bruising and petechiae, along with the abnormal coagulation profile, suggest a bleeding disorder. The normal complete blood count rules out thrombocytopenia, making option C (immune thrombocytopenic purpura) less likely.\n\nThe prolonged aPTT (60 sec) suggests a defect in the intrinsic or common coagulation pathway. The normal PT (12 sec) suggests that the extrinsic pathway is intact.\n\nHemophilia A (classic hemophilia) is a deficiency of factor VIII, which is part of the intrinsic pathway. This would cause a prolonged aPTT, as seen in this patient. Hemophilia B (Christmas disease) is a deficiency of factor IX, which is also part of the intrinsic pathway, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and coagulation profile.\n\nVon Willebrand disease (option D) is a defect in von Willebrand factor, which affects platelet function and the intrinsic pathway. While it could cause a prolonged aPTT, it is less likely given the patient's normal platelet count and the severity of his symptoms.\n\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia (option A) is a type of cancer that can cause bleeding due to bone marrow suppression, but it is less likely given the patient's normal complete blood count and coagulation profile.",

Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by tunica vaginalis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a hydrocele, which is a fluid-filled sac surrounding the testicle. The fact that the mass transilluminates, is soft and cystic, and does not increase in size on coughing suggests that it is a hydrocele. The normal examination of the testis and the absence of bowel sounds in the mass also support this diagnosis.\n\nHydroceles are caused by an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis, a layer of tissue that surrounds the testicle. This imbalance can lead to the accumulation of fluid in the space between the tunica vaginalis and the testicle, resulting in a hydrocele.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a failure of the processus vaginalis to obliterate would result in a congenital inguinal hernia, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Option C is also incorrect because an extension of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal would result in an inguinal hernia, which would likely be tender and would have bowel sounds. Option D is incorrect because dilation and tortuosity of veins in the pampiniform plexus would result in a varicocele, which is a different condition.

The baby\u2019s oocytes are arrested in prophase.\n\nAt birth, a female infant's ovaries contain approximately 1-2 million oocytes, which are arrested in prophase I of meiosis. This means that the oocytes have begun the process of meiosis, but have not yet completed it. They will remain in this state of arrested development until puberty, when they will begin to mature and be released during ovulation.",

One year ago, a peripheral blood smear performed during workup of fatigue revealed erythrocytes without central pallor. His father had gallstones, for which he underwent a cholecystectomy at the age of 26 years. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes, mild scleral icterus, a swollen, red tongue, and several mouth ulcers. There is darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles. His spleen is enlarged and palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin.

Folic acid supplementation.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including a burning sensation in the mouth, mouth ulcers, and a swollen, red tongue, are consistent with a folate deficiency. The patient's medical history, including a peripheral blood smear showing erythrocytes without central pallor, suggests that the patient has a congenital disorder affecting hemoglobin synthesis, likely beta-thalassemia. The patient's father's history of gallstones at a young age also supports this diagnosis, as beta-thalassemia can lead to increased hemolysis and bilirubin production, causing gallstones.\n\nFolic acid supplementation would have helped to prevent the patient's oropharyngeal symptoms, which are related to the folate deficiency. The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or underlying condition.",

Sitagliptin.\n\nThe experimental drug described in the question prevents the degradation of incretins at the endothelium, which increases glucose-dependent insulin production. This is similar to the mechanism of action of sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. DPP-4 is an enzyme that breaks down incretins, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). By inhibiting DPP-4, sitagliptin increases the levels of active incretins, which in turn stimulate insulin secretion and improve glucose control.\n\nExenatide (A) is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, which works by mimicking the action of GLP-1, but it does not prevent its degradation.\n\nGlimepiride (C) is a sulfonylurea that stimulates insulin secretion by binding to the sulfonylurea receptor on pancreatic beta cells.\n\nCanagliflozin (D) is a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which works by increasing urinary glucose excretion.\n\nPioglitazone (E) is a thiazolidinedione that improves insulin sensitivity by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3).",

His asthmatic symptoms are usually well controlled with regular high-dose inhaled triamcinolone, but over the last week or so he has developed a nocturnal cough and mild wheezing despite good compliance with controller medications. A review of several spirometry reports suggest of bronchial asthma with a partial irreversible airway obstruction. Which of the following is most likely to be associated with the recent loss of asthma control in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Airway epithelial shedding\nB. Airway smooth muscle atrophy\nC. Airway remodeling\nD. Airway inflammation\nE. Airway hyperresponsiveness\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Airway remodeling.\n\nThe patient's history of severe persistent asthma since childhood, partial irreversible airway obstruction, and recent loss of asthma control despite good compliance with controller medications suggest that airway remodeling may be contributing to the recent exacerbation. Airway remodeling refers to the structural changes that occur in the airways over time, including fibrosis, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and epithelial thickening, which can lead to irreversible airflow obstruction. This is a common feature of severe asthma and can contribute to loss of asthma control.\n\nAirway epithelial shedding (A) is a feature of acute asthma exacerbations, but it is not the most likely explanation for the patient's recent loss of asthma control. Airway smooth muscle atrophy (B) is not a typical feature of asthma. Airway inflammation (D) is a key component of asthma, but it is not the most likely explanation for the patient's recent loss of asthma control, given that they have been taking high-dose inhaled corticosteroids. Airway hyperresponsiveness (E) is a hallmark of asthma, but it is not the most likely explanation for the patient's recent loss of asthma control.",

On physical examination, her left leg appears pink and slightly swollen. Homan\u2019s sign is positive. A Doppler ultrasound reveals a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. Her lab results are as follows:\nPlatelets 250,000/mm3\nProthrombin Time 14 sec\nPartial Thromboplastin Time 90 sec\nMixing study (PTT) 89 sec\nWhat is the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. Antibodies directed against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa\nB. Antibodies directed against phospholipids\nC. Antibodies directed against endothelial cells\nD. Vitamin K deficiency\nE. Disseminated intravascular coagulation\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Antibodies directed against phospholipids.\n\nThe patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus and spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks gestation suggests the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, which are a common feature of antiphospholipid syndrome. The laboratory results, particularly the prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) that does not correct with a mixing study, are consistent with the presence of a lupus anticoagulant, which is a type of antiphospholipid antibody. The patient's symptoms and Doppler ultrasound results are consistent with deep vein thrombosis, which is a common complication of antiphospholipid syndrome.\n\nAntibodies directed against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (Option A) are associated with immune thrombocytopenia, not thrombosis. Antibodies directed against endothelial cells (Option C) are not a well-defined entity and are not typically associated with thrombosis. Vitamin K deficiency (Option D) would cause a prolonged prothrombin time, not a prolonged PTT. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (Option E) would cause a more severe coagulopathy with evidence of consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, which is not seen in this patient.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 22-year-old woman with a history of asthma visits her physician for worsening shortness of breath. She states that she feels as though her \u201clungs are falling apart,\u201d noting that her lung function has been steadily deteriorating. She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from \u201crandom\u201d bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, \u201cYes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.\u201d She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/70 mm Hg, pulse 66/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base. There are also branched radiodensities that the radiologist notes as being \u201cglove-finger shadows\u201d (noted by the arrow in the image). Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are elevated. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Isoniazid\nB. Fluconazole\nC. Caspofungin\nD. Prednisone\nE. Surgical resection of the infiltrates\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Prednisone.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including worsening shortness of breath, coughing and wheezing episodes, fever, malaise, and expectoration of brown mucous plugs, are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). The chest radiograph showing atelectasis in the right lung base and \"glove-finger shadows\" (also known as \"tree-in-bud\" opacities) is also characteristic of CF. The elevated serum IgE levels support this diagnosis.\n\nPrednisone is a corticosteroid that is often used to treat CF exacerbations, as it can help reduce inflammation and improve lung function. While antibiotics may also be necessary to treat bacterial infections, prednisone is the most appropriate initial therapy to address the patient's respiratory symptoms and inflammation.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the treatment of CF:\n\nA. Isoniazid is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis.\n\nB. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections.\n\nC. Caspofungin is an antifungal medication used to treat invasive fungal infections.\n\nE. Surgical resection of the infiltrates is not a primary treatment for CF and may not be necessary in this case.",

There is no history of headaches, vomiting, or loss of consciousness. The past medical history is unobtainable due to a language barrier (the patient recently immigrated from abroad), but his wife says her husband had a motor vehicle accident when he was a teenager that required surgery. He is transferred to the ICU after a few hours in the ED because of dyspnea, cyanosis, and near-collapse. There are no signs of a meningeal infection. The Blood pressure was 70/30 mm Hg at the time of transfer. A chest X-ray at the time of admission showed interstitial infiltrates without homogeneous opacities. The initial laboratory results reveal metabolic acidosis, leukopenia with a count of 2,000/mm\u00b3, thrombocytopenia (15,000/mm\u00b3), and a coagulation profile suggestive of disseminated coagulation. A peripheral smear was performed and is shown below. Despite ventilatory support, administration of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressor agents, the patient died the next day. A gram stain from an autopsy specimen of the lungs revealed gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains. Which of the following organisms is most likely?\nOptions:\nA. Staphylococcus aureus\nB. Streptococcus pyogene\nC. Streptococcus pneumoniae\nD. Neisseria meningitidis\nE. Non-typeable H. influenzae\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nThe peripheral smear shows red blood cells with multiple small, ring-shaped structures, which are consistent with spherocytes.

His past medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipidemia. He is taking a number of drugs but does not remember what they are. A panel of metabolic and lipid tests are ordered and show worsening of his metabolic parameters. Based on these findings, his physician prescribes a drug that leads to a large decrease in triglycerides with a much smaller increase in high-density lipoproteins and decrease in low-density lipoproteins.

Decreased vitamin D absorption\nD. Hepatotoxicity\nE. Teratogenicity\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Cholelithiasis.\n\nThe patient's metabolic and lipid test results suggest that the prescribed drug is a fibrate, which is a class of medications that effectively lower triglycerides and increase HDL cholesterol, with a smaller effect on LDL cholesterol. Fibrates are commonly used to treat hypertriglyceridemia and are often prescribed for patients with diabetes and hyperlipidemia.\n\nOne of the known side effects of fibrates is an increased risk of cholelithiasis (gallstones). This is because fibrates can increase the concentration of cholesterol in bile, making it more likely to form gallstones.\n\nAcanthosis nigricans (A) is a skin condition associated with insulin resistance, not a side effect of fibrates. Decreased vitamin D absorption (C) is a side effect of some medications, but not typically associated with fibrates.

She recalls being instructed by prior physicians to follow a diet that avoids certain foods; however, she admits to not being complaint with these recommendations. Laboratory testing reveals a plasma phenylalanine level of 20.2 mg/dL (normal range <2 mg/dL). Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Even with appropriate treatment, your condition will prevent you from becoming pregnant\nB. Improved PKU treatment will decrease the risks of spontaneous abortion and intrauterine fetal death\nC. 3 months prior to conception, begin a restricted diet to lower phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL\nD. Begin a phenylalanine-restricted diet in your first trimester to reduce the risk of fetal morbidity\nE. Your current phenylalanine levels do not pose a risk to any future pregnancy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. 3 months prior to conception, begin a restricted diet to lower phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL.\n\nWomen with phenylketonuria (PKU) who become pregnant have a higher risk of having a child with intellectual disability, microcephaly, and congenital heart defects if their phenylalanine levels are not well controlled during pregnancy. To minimize these risks, it is recommended that women with PKU follow a phenylalanine-restricted diet before conception and throughout pregnancy. The goal is to lower phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL, which is considered safe for fetal development. This should be done at least 3 months prior to conception to ensure that the levels are under control before pregnancy.",

The pain lasts 10\u201315 minutes and resolves spontaneously. She is unable to identify any common preceding event to pain onset. The remainder of her history is unremarkable and she takes no regular medications. She works as an accountant. There is no history of smoking or drug use, however, she does consume 5 alcoholic drinks per week. Examination reveals: pulse 70/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg.

Over the past 2 days, he has also been feeling weak and tired. When standing up after sitting for a while, he feels dizzy. He says he has to go to the bathroom more often than usual, and that he is urinating \u201ca normal amount\u201d each time. He has not had diarrhea. He has hypertension, for which he has been taking hydrochlorothiazide for the past 6 months. He drinks 9 glasses of water per day and takes his medication regularly. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 90 kg (198 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. His temperature is 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), blood pressure is 106/54 mm Hg, and pulse is 92/min. Physical examination shows whitening of the tongue. Skin that is pinched on the back of the hand retracts after 5 seconds.

Diuretic overdose\nB. Osmotic diuresis\nC. Gastroinstestinal fluid loss\nD. Excess production of aldosterone\nE. Insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Gastrointestinal fluid loss.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and dizziness when standing up suggest dehydration.\n* The physical examination findings of whitening of the tongue and skin that takes 5 seconds to retract after pinching on the back of the hand are also consistent with dehydration.\n* The laboratory studies show a serum sodium level of 150 mEq/L, which is slightly low, and a serum osmolality of 354 mOsm/kg, which is also slightly low. This suggests that the patient has a hypotonic dehydration.\n* The urine osmolality of 400 mOsm/kg is relatively high, which suggests that the kidneys are trying to conserve water.\n* The patient's medication, hydrochlorothiazide, can cause dehydration, but it would not typically cause a hypotonic dehydration.\n* Osmotic diuresis (option B) would cause a high serum osmolality, not a low one.\n* Diuretic overdose (option A) would cause a high urine output, but the patient's urine osmolality is high, suggesting that the kidneys are conserving water.\n* Excess production of aldosterone (option D) would cause hypertension and hypokalemia, but the patient's blood pressure is low, and his potassium level is normal.\n* Insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone (option E) would cause diabetes insipidus, which would result in a high serum osmolality and a low urine osmolality, the opposite of what is seen in this patient.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation for these findings is gastrointestinal fluid loss due to the patient's nausea and vomiting, leading to dehydration.",

The woman's fasting blood glucose level is 120 mg/dL and two-hour post 75g glucose load blood glucose level is 190 mg/dL. The physician informs the patient that she is \"pre-diabetic\" or at risk of developing diabetes and recommends lifestyle modification with follow-up in 6 months. Which of the following endogenous signaling molecules or receptors will increase insulin sensitivity in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Catecholamines\nB. Glucagon\nC. Glucocorticoids\nD. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma\nE. TNF-alpha\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.\n\nPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) is a nuclear receptor that plays a key role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. Activation of PPAR\u03b3 increases insulin sensitivity, which is beneficial for individuals with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes.

Catecholamines (such as epinephrine and norepinephrine) decrease insulin sensitivity and increase glucose release from storage sites.\n\nB. Glucagon raises blood glucose levels by stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, and decreases insulin sensitivity.\n\nC. Glucocorticoids (such as cortisol) decrease insulin sensitivity and increase glucose release from storage sites.\n\nE. TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor-alpha) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that decreases insulin sensitivity and contributes to insulin resistance.",

He is found to be delayed in reaching normal childhood cognitive and social milestones, which is consistent with observations at previous check-ups. Physically, he is also found to be significantly overweight with hypogonadism. Notably, the boy was limp when he was born and did not have a normal motor response to stimuli. Elevated levels of a gastrointestinal hormone are associated with the cause of this patient's weight gain. The hormone that is most responsible for causing the weight gain is produced in which of the following cell types?\nOptions:\nA. D cells\nB. G cells\nC. I cells\nD. P/D1 cells\nE. L cells\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. L cells.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including delayed cognitive and social milestones, hypogonadism, and significant overweight, are consistent with Prader-Willi syndrome. This syndrome is associated with elevated levels of ghrelin, a gastrointestinal hormone produced by L cells in the gastrointestinal tract. Ghrelin stimulates appetite and food intake, leading to weight gain.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: Accurate and rapid identification of individuals with tuberculosis (TB) is crucial to accomplishing the goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to eliminate this disease. One of the key strategies for the detection of TB is the use of tuberculin skin testing as a globally pertinent screening method, due to its low cost and technical simplicity. A study from Brazil demonstrated 76.7% accuracy, 67.9% sensitivity, 84.4% specificity, 79.1% positive predictive value, and 75% negative predictive value when using 5-mm skin elevation as a threshold, or cut-off, point for the screening test (following intradermal injection). Lowering the cut-off point to 4 mm would also result in an increase in which test property?\nOptions:\nA. Convergent validity\nB. Discriminant validity\nC. Positive predictive value\nD. Negative predictive value\nE. Test specificity\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Negative predictive value.\n\nLowering the cut-off point from 5 mm to 4 mm would increase the number of true negatives (people who do not have TB and test negative) and decrease the number of false negatives (people who have TB but test negative). This would result in an increase in the negative predictive value, which is the proportion of people who test negative and do not have the disease.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. Convergent validity refers to the extent to which different measures of the same concept are correlated. It is not directly related to the cut-off point of a test.\n\nB. Discriminant validity refers to the ability of a test to distinguish between people with and without a disease. While lowering the cut-off point may affect the test's ability to discriminate between people with and without TB, it would not directly increase discriminant validity.\n\nC. Positive predictive value is the proportion of people who test positive and actually have the disease. Lowering the cut-off point would likely decrease the positive predictive value, as more people without TB would test positive.\n\nE. Test specificity is the proportion of people without TB who test negative. Lowering the cut-off point would likely decrease test specificity, as more people without TB would test positive.",

She reports that the child cries several times per day and sleeps 7-8 hours at night, uninterrupted. She has been breastfeeding exclusively and feels that he has been feeding well. Which of the following is the best treatment for this condition?\nOptions:\nA. Phototherapy\nB. Phenobarbital administration\nC. Plasma exchange\nD. Switch from breast milk to formula\nE. Continue normal breast feeding\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Continue normal breast feeding.\n\nThe symptoms described, such as jaundice (yellow skin) in a one-week-old full-term infant who is breastfeeding well and has a normal sleep pattern, are consistent with physiologic jaundice, a common and benign condition in newborns. Physiologic jaundice is caused by the breakdown of fetal hemoglobin and is usually treated with continued breastfeeding and monitoring. In this case, the infant is feeding well and has a normal sleep pattern, which suggests that the jaundice is not causing any significant distress.\n\nThe other options are not appropriate treatments for physiologic jaundice:\n\nA. Phototherapy is used to treat pathologic jaundice, which is a more severe condition that requires medical intervention.\n\nB. Phenobarbital administration is not a treatment for jaundice in newborns.\n\nC. Plasma exchange is a treatment for severe cases of jaundice, but it is not necessary for physiologic jaundice.\n\nD. Switching from breast milk to formula is not necessary and may even exacerbate the condition, as breast milk helps to promote the excretion of bilirubin, the pigment responsible for jaundice.",

At first, she would notice leakage only during athletic exercise, but now the incontinence occurs even when she laughs or coughs. The patient states that she goes to the bathroom more frequently to try to prevent \u201cwetting myself.\u201d She wakes up once a night to urinate. She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she \u201cneeds to focus.\u201d The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use. Pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable. When that patient is asked to Valsalva, leakage of urine is observed. A urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Diabetic polyuria\nB. Overactive detrusor muscle\nC. Primary polydipsia\nD. Urethral hypermobility\nE. Vescicovaginal fistula\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Urethral hypermobility.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of urinary leakage that progresses from occurring only during athletic exercise to occurring with laughing or coughing, and the observation of urine leakage during Valsalva maneuver, suggest stress urinary incontinence (SUI). SUI is often caused by urethral hypermobility, which is a weakening of the pelvic floor muscles and connective tissue that support the urethra. This can occur due to childbirth, surgery, or other factors.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and examination:\n\nA. Diabetic polyuria would cause frequent urination and polyuria, but not specifically stress incontinence.\n\nB. Overactive detrusor muscle would cause urinary frequency, urgency, and possibly incontinence, but not specifically stress incontinence.\n\nC. Primary polydipsia would cause excessive thirst and urination, but not specifically stress incontinence.\n\nE. Vescicovaginal fistula would cause continuous urinary incontinence, not stress incontinence triggered by specific activities.",

She was at a party when she suddenly fell to the floor. Her friends state that she was not responsive and was acting oddly. After the episode, the patient seemed confused and had no memory of the event. The patient has a past medical history of substance abuse, depression, and anxiety. Her temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), blood pressure is 117/69 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals a girl who seems confused and responds to questions slowly. Her gait is stable, and she demonstrates 5/5 strength in her upper and lower extremities. Laboratory values and a urine dipstick test are performed as seen below:\n\nToxicology:\nBenzodiazepines: Positive\nMarijuana: Positive\nCocaine: Negative\nPhencyclidine: Negative\n\nUrine Dipstick:\nAppearance: Dark\nRed blood cells: Positive\nGlucose: Negative\n\nWhich of the following is the best next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Diazepam\nB. Electroencelphalography\nC. IV fluids and mannitol\nD. Phenytoin\nE. Supportive therapy and observation\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. IV fluids and mannitol.\n\nThe patient's presentation, including altered mental status, confusion, and a positive urine dipstick for red blood cells, suggests a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, which is a condition characterized by muscle breakdown and release of muscle enzymes into the bloodstream. The dark appearance of the urine also supports this diagnosis.\n\nThe presence of benzodiazepines and marijuana in the toxicology screen may have contributed to the patient's altered mental status, but they do not explain the red blood cells in the urine.\n\nThe best next step in management is to administer IV fluids and mannitol to help flush out the muscle enzymes and prevent kidney damage. Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that can help increase urine production and reduce the risk of kidney injury.\n\nDiazepam (A) may be used to treat seizures or anxiety, but it is not the best next step in this scenario. Electroencephalography (B) may be useful in evaluating the patient's altered mental status, but it is not the most urgent priority. Phenytoin (D) is an anticonvulsant that may be used to treat seizures, but it is not indicated in this scenario. Supportive therapy and observation (E) may be necessary, but they are not the most important next step in managing the patient's rhabdomyolysis.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 29-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain for 2 hours. Her current pregnancy was achieved by means of in vitro fertilization due to azoospermia in her partner. Prenatal course has been uncomplicated with regular prenatal visits. After a period of having avoided sexual intercourse during her early pregnancy, she resumed sexual activity with her partner at week 22 of gestation. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate; her other child was delivered vaginally. She has had abnormal Pap smears due to HPV in the past. Her pulse is 82/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, the uterus is consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is in a cephalic presentation. There are traces of blood on the vulva and the introitus. Speculum examination shows a tender, bruised cervix, with a closed cervical os. Fetal heart rate is 166/min and CTG shows a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall. What is the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding?\nOptions:\nA. Pedunculated cervical growth\nB. Inflammation of the cervix\nC. Cervical trauma\nD. Fetal vessels overlying cervical os\nE. Premature separation of the placenta\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Cervical trauma.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain, along with the physical examination findings of a tender, bruised cervix, suggest that the bleeding is likely due to cervical trauma. The fact that she resumed sexual activity at 22 weeks' gestation and has a closed cervical os makes cervical trauma a more likely cause than other options.",

His parents say that the boy was doing well until two days ago when he told them that he was feeling unwell. He has diabetes and takes insulin but stopped taking it when he began to feel poorly two days ago. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), respirations are shallow and rapid with a rate of 33/min, pulse is 107/min, and blood pressure is 101/68 mm Hg. He appears severely dehydrated, showing signs of fatigue, and poor skin turgor. His breath has a fruity smell to it. His blood glucose level is 691 mg/dL. Blood is drawn for labs and the results are given below:\nSerum:  \n  pH: 7.21\n  pCO2: 32 mm HG\n  HCO 3-: 15.2 mEq/L\nSodium: 122 mEq/L\nPotassium: 5.8 mEq/L\nUrinalysis is positive for ketone bodies.

Administer IV fluids with oral antidiabetic medications\nD. Administer IV bicarbonate\nE. Administer potassium and magnesium\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Administer IV fluids and insulin.\n\nThe patient is presenting with symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of diabetes. The diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of stopping insulin, high blood glucose level, and presence of ketone bodies in the urine. The patient's lab results also show a metabolic acidosis with a low pH, low bicarbonate level, and high anion gap.\n\nThe immediate management of DKA involves administering IV fluids to correct dehydration and insulin to lower blood glucose levels. IV fluids help to replenish lost fluids, electrolytes, and reduce blood glucose levels. Insulin administration helps to reduce glucose production in the liver and increase glucose uptake in the peripheral tissues.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nB. IV antibiotics are not indicated in the management of DKA.\n\nC. Oral antidiabetic medications are not effective in the management of DKA, and IV fluids are necessary to correct dehydration.\n\nD. IV bicarbonate is not recommended in the management of DKA unless the patient's pH is very low (<6.9).\n\nE. While potassium and magnesium levels may need to be monitored and replaced, they are not the most immediate step in the management of DKA.",

He reports that one hour ago he was climbing the stairs in his home when he suddenly developed excruciating chest pain. He describes the pain as ripping and radiating to the back. The patient\u2019s past medical history is significant for a heart murmur that is being followed by his outpatient cardiologist. He takes no medications. The patient works as a carpenter and reports being monogamous with his wife. He denies any history of intravenous drug use or recent travel. In the emergency department, the patient\u2019s temperature is 99.4\u00b0F (37.4\u00b0C), blood pressure is 94/56 mmHg, pulse is 121/min, and respirations are 14/min. On physical exam, the patient appears to be in moderate distress and is clutching his chest. He is tall and has joint hypermobility. His breath sounds are equal and full bilaterally and has weak distal pulses.\n\nWhich of the following is most likely to be found in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Holosystolic, high-pitched blowing murmur at the lower left sternal border\nB. Late systolic crescendo murmur at the apex with mid-systolic click\nC. Mid-diastolic murmur at the apex with opening snap\nD. Mid-diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border\nE. Systolic ejection murmur at the right second intercostal space\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Holosystolic, high-pitched blowing murmur at the lower left sternal border.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with an aortic dissection, which is a tear in the lining of the aorta. The patient's history of a heart murmur, tall stature, and joint hypermobility suggest that he may have Marfan syndrome, a genetic disorder that can increase the risk of aortic dissection.\n\nThe murmur described in option A is consistent with a murmur that may be heard in patients with aortic regurgitation, which can occur as a result of an aortic dissection. The other options do not match the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings.",

They try to ask her what is wrong, but she does not respond and persists crying for approximately 20 minutes, after which she goes back to sleeping comfortably. Upon awaking the following morning, she has no recollection of the night's events. Which of the following is true about these episodes?\nOptions:\nA. They will be persistent into adulthood\nB. They occur only during non-REM sleep\nC. They can occur any time during the sleep cycle\nD. They are associated with child abuse\nE. They are associated with later development of a mood disorder\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. They occur only during non-REM sleep.\n\nThe symptoms described in the question are consistent with night terrors, also known as sleep terrors. Night terrors are a type of parasomnia that occurs during deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, usually in the first third of the night. They are characterized by sudden episodes of screaming, crying, and thrashing, often accompanied by a sense of fear or panic. The child is usually unresponsive to attempts to comfort them and may not remember the episode in the morning.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\nA. Night terrors are generally outgrown by adolescence and are not persistent into adulthood.\n\nC. Night terrors occur specifically during deep NREM sleep, not any time during the sleep cycle.\n\nD.

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: Two hours after admission to the hospital for dialysis, a 63-year-old woman has severe pain in her lower back. The pain is 8 out of 10 in intensity and radiates down the legs. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 4 years ago. She has hypertension, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and major depressive disorder. She lives with her daughter and reports frequent fights with her at home. Her current medications include sertraline, insulin, enalapril, sodium bicarbonate, and sevelamer. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 37.3\u00b0C (99.1\u00b0F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 132/94 mm Hg. There is severe tenderness on palpation over the L2 vertebra; range of motion is limited. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 10.1 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 8,700/mm3\nPlatelet count 130,000/mm3\nSerum\nNa+ 136 mEq/L\nCl- 101 mEq/L\nK+ 5.1 mEq/L\nCalcium 8.2 mg/dL\nUrea nitrogen 33 mg/dL\nGlucose 190 mg/dL\nCreatinine 3.8 mg/dL\nAn x-ray of the spine shows a wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?\"\nOptions:\nA. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism\nB. Secondary hyperparathyroidism\nC. Elder abuse\nD. Pseudohypoparathyroidism\nE. Primary hyperparathyroidism\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Secondary hyperparathyroidism.\n\nThe patient's laboratory results show an elevated potassium level (5.1 mEq/L) and a high creatinine level (3.8 mg/dL), indicating chronic kidney disease. The wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra is likely due to osteoporosis, which is a common complication of chronic kidney disease. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a common complication of chronic kidney disease, where the parathyroid glands overproduce parathyroid hormone in response to low calcium levels and high phosphate levels. This can lead to bone resorption and osteoporosis, resulting in compression fractures.\n\nTertiary hyperparathyroidism (A) is a rare condition that occurs when a parathyroid gland becomes autonomous and continues to produce excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone even after the underlying cause has been treated. While it is possible, it is less likely than secondary hyperparathyroidism in this scenario.\n\nElder abuse (C) is not supported by the patient's history or physical examination.\n\nPseudohypoparathyroidism (D) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the response to parathyroid hormone, leading to hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. It is not consistent with the patient's laboratory results or clinical presentation.\n\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism (E) is a condition where one or more parathyroid glands become overactive and produce excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone, leading to hypercalcemia. It is not consistent with the patient's laboratory results, which show a normal calcium level.",

Carbonic anhydrase\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Lactic acid dehydrogenase.\n\nBisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme that converts 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate in the glycolytic pathway. It is present in high concentrations in red blood cells, where it helps to regulate the levels of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, a key allosteric effector of hemoglobin.\n\nIn cells with elevated bisphosphoglycerate mutase, it is likely that the glycolytic pathway is favored, and the cells are producing more ATP through anaerobic glycolysis. As a result, the cells are less likely to produce lactic acid, which is the end product of anaerobic glycolysis. Therefore, lactic acid dehydrogenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, is likely to be absent or present at low levels in these cells.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the presence of bisphosphoglycerate mutase and are therefore less likely to be absent in these cells.",

Cerebral aqueduct\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Interventricular foramen.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and the MRI finding of isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle suggest a blockage of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the lateral ventricle. The interventricular foramen (also known as the foramen of Monro) connects the lateral ventricle to the third ventricle and allows CSF to flow from the lateral ventricle to the third ventricle. A blockage of this foramen would cause the lateral ventricle to dilate.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Arachnoid villi are small projections of the arachnoid membrane that allow CSF to be absorbed into the bloodstream. Blockage of arachnoid villi would not cause isolated dilation of the lateral ventricle.\n\nC. The median aperture (also known as the foramen of Magendie) is a opening in the roof of the fourth ventricle that allows CSF to flow out of the ventricular system. Blockage of this aperture would affect the entire ventricular system, not just the lateral ventricle.\n\nD. Lateral apertures (also known as the foramina of Luschka) are openings in the lateral walls of the fourth ventricle that allow CSF to flow out of the ventricular system. Blockage of these apertures would affect the entire ventricular system, not just the lateral ventricle.\n\nE. The cerebral aqueduct connects the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle and allows CSF to flow from the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle. Blockage of the cerebral aqueduct would affect the entire ventricular system, not just the lateral ventricle.",

Vitamin K deficiency\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Vitamin K deficiency.\n\nThe symptoms described, such as lethargy, easy bruising, and petechiae, are consistent with a bleeding disorder. The fact that the child was born at home with minimal prenatal or postnatal care suggests that the child may not have received vitamin K prophylaxis at birth, which is a routine practice in many countries to prevent bleeding disorders in newborns. Vitamin K deficiency is a common cause of bleeding disorders in newborns, especially in those who did not receive prophylaxis at birth.",

Which of the following factors about this patient most strongly indicates a poor prognosis?\nOptions:\nA. Age\nB. Cytogenetics\nC. Fever and neutropenia\nD. Initial presentation\nE. Immunological subtype\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Cytogenetics.\n\nThe presence of the Philadelphia chromosome (t(9;22)) in a patient with acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a poor prognostic factor. This chromosomal abnormality is typically associated with a worse outcome in ALL.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Age: While age can be a prognostic factor in ALL, 9 years old is not typically considered a high-risk age group.\n\nC. Fever and neutropenia: While fever and neutropenia are serious complications of chemotherapy, they are not necessarily indicative of a poor prognosis in this patient.\n\nD. Initial presentation: The patient's initial presentation with fatigue and pancytopenia is not unusual for ALL, and does not necessarily indicate a poor prognosis.\n\nE. Immunological subtype: While T-ALL can have a worse prognosis than B-ALL, the immunological subtype itself is not the strongest indicator of a poor prognosis in this patient.",

He also reports headaches and numbness in both hands. Over the past 4 months, he has had intermittent lower back pain after waking up. The back pain improves with movement. He also has recurrent episodes of gout in the metatarsophalangeal joint of his right big toe. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years and drinks four beers daily. The patient is a known user of intravenous heroin. He appears acutely ill. His temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg. There are several track marks on both forearms. Examination of the neck shows warmth, erythema, and limited range of motion. Gentle palpation over the midcervical spinal processes causes severe pain.

Over the past week, she has been projectile vomiting after most feedings. Initially, the vomiting would occur just once or twice a day, but now it occurs after every feed. However, her appetite hasn\u2019t decreased, and she seeks milk right after each episode of vomiting. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is breastfed exclusively. On physical exam, the vital signs include: temperature 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), blood pressure 85/55 mm Hg, respiratory rate 28/min, and heart rate 150/min. On examination, she appears to be mildly dehydrated, listless, and irritable. Her abdomen is soft and nontender with a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region. Which of the following acid-base disturbances is most likely associated with this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. Respiratory alkalosis\nB. Metabolic acidosis\nC. Metabolic alkalosis\nD. Respiratory acidosis\nE. Mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Metabolic alkalosis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as projectile vomiting, dehydration, and irritability, are consistent with pyloric stenosis, a condition that causes narrowing of the pylorus, which connects the stomach to the small intestine. The palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region is also a characteristic finding in pyloric stenosis.\n\nThe vomiting leads to loss of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and potassium ions, which can cause metabolic alkalosis. The body tries to compensate by increasing respiratory rate to expel more carbon dioxide, which can lead to respiratory alkalosis as well. However, in this case, the metabolic alkalosis is the primary acid-base disturbance.\n\nMetabolic acidosis (option B) is unlikely because the patient is losing acidic gastric contents, which would increase the pH of the blood. Respiratory alkalosis (option A) may occur as a compensatory response to metabolic alkalosis, but it is not the primary acid-base disturbance. Respiratory acidosis (option D) and mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis (option E) are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.",

Ineffective CD8 cytotoxicity\nB. gag gene mutation\nC. env gene mutation\nD. pol gene mutation\nE. Decreased viral replication\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. pol gene mutation.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a failure of HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) treatment, which is likely due to the development of resistance to the antiretroviral medications. The pol gene codes for the HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme, which is the target of many antiretroviral medications. Mutations in the pol gene can lead to resistance to these medications, making them less effective in suppressing viral replication.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the lack of responsiveness to HAART therapy:\n\nA. Ineffective CD8 cytotoxicity refers to the immune system's inability to kill infected cells, which is not directly related to the failure of HAART.\n\nB. gag gene mutation is not typically associated with resistance to HAART.\n\nC. env gene mutation is related to the virus's ability to infect cells, but it is not directly related to the failure of HAART.\n\nE.

Spinal metastasis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including back pain, bilateral lower limb weakness, and difficulty controlling bowel movements, suggest a compressive lesion in the spinal cord. The presence of a hard nodular mass on rectal examination and a weak rectal sphincter tone further support this diagnosis. Spinal metastasis is a common cause of spinal cord compression in adults, and it is likely that the patient's cancer has metastasized to the spine, causing his symptoms.\n\nSyringomyelia (A) is a condition characterized by a fluid-filled cavity in the spinal cord, which can cause weakness, numbness, and loss of reflexes, but it is less likely to cause a hard nodular mass on rectal examination.\n\nA herniated disc (C) can cause back pain and weakness, but it is typically unilateral and would not cause a hard nodular mass on rectal examination.\n\nAn epidural abscess (D) is a bacterial infection that can cause spinal cord compression, but it would typically present with fever, chills, and rapid progression of symptoms, which are not mentioned in this scenario.\n\nA spinal hematoma (E) is a bleeding disorder that can cause spinal cord compression, but it is rare and would typically present with sudden onset of symptoms, which is not the case here.",

He first noticed the daytime sleepiness about a year ago but reports that it significantly worsened once he started college. He reports that he goes to bed around 9 p.m. and wakes up for class at 8 a.m.. He naps between classes for a total of 4 hours during the day. Despite this, he wakes up feeling exhausted. He easily falls asleep during class and while studying. This has started to affect both his academics and his social life. On weekends, he can sleep up to 20 hours a day. He reports 2 recent episodes of sudden generalized body weakness along with ptosis and difficulty speaking that occurred after he became angry. Each episode lasted about 10 seconds, but he says he felt back to normal within 15 minutes without any persistent deficits. His Epworth Sleepiness Scale score is 17. Which of the following is the best next step in therapy?\nOptions:\nA. Clomipramine\nB. Dextroamphetamine\nC. Methylpenidate\nD. Modafinil\nE. Sleep deprivation\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Modafinil.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with narcolepsy, a chronic neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness), and disrupted nighttime sleep. The patient's Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 17 also supports this diagnosis.\n\nModafinil is a wake-promoting medication that is commonly used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy.

She developed worsening malaise and diaphoresis over the past 48 hours. Her maximum temperature was 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C) taken the night before presentation. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder, obesity, fibromyalgia, and severe tension headaches. She previously took paroxetine for a 2-month trial but switched to citalopram 6 months ago as she did not feel like paroxetine was adequately helping her symptoms. Her mood has been stable on her current dose of citalopram. She takes ibuprofen for her headaches but previously borrowed a friend\u2019s headache medication when her headaches became very severe. Of note, she has been trying to lose weight and recently started taking an amino acid supplement at the suggestion of her nephew who is a nutritionist. She is also trying out a new low-carbohydrate diet. She works as a nurse at a local primary care clinic.

Rocker bottom feet\nE. Duodenal atresia\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Rocker bottom feet.\n\nThe symptoms described in the question, including pulmonary hypoplasia, low-set ears, retrognathia, and abnormal extremity development, are consistent with Potter sequence, a rare congenital disorder caused by oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid) due to bilateral renal agenesis (absence of kidneys). Rocker bottom feet are a characteristic feature of Potter sequence.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the symptoms described:\n\nA. Hepatosplenomegaly is associated with various conditions, including liver disease, but not with pulmonary hypoplasia or the other symptoms described.\n\nB. Macroorchidism is a feature of Fragile X syndrome, which is not related to the symptoms described.\n\nC. Posterior urethral valves are a congenital anomaly that can cause urinary tract obstruction, but they are not typically associated with pulmonary hypoplasia or the other symptoms described.\n\nE. Duodenal atresia is a congenital intestinal obstruction, but it is not directly related to the symptoms described.",

During these episodes, she has had nausea and vomiting. She has no diarrhea, dysuria, or hematuria and is asymptomatic between episodes. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Seven years ago, she underwent resection of the terminal ileum because of severe Crohn's disease. She is 155 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (175 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. Her temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.5\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/95 mm Hg. There is mild scleral icterus. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The stool is brown, and test for occult blood is negative.

D-dimer.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and right-sided chest pain, especially with inspiration, are concerning for a pulmonary embolism (PE). The fact that she recently traveled from New York to the west coast also increases her risk for a PE. Given her pregnancy, a D-dimer assay is a reasonable next step in the evaluation. A D-dimer is a sensitive test for PE, and a negative result can help rule out the diagnosis.

Collagen vascular disease\nE. Group D streptococci\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Viridans streptococci.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest endocarditis, which is supported by the presence of a new-onset high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur, conjunctival hemorrhages, and petechiae on his lower extremities. The \"head bobbing with each heartbeat\" is also consistent with endocarditis.\n\nThe most likely explanation for the cardiac findings is infective endocarditis caused by Viridans streptococci, which is a common cause of endocarditis in patients with underlying cardiac conditions or in those with a history of dental procedures. The patient's history of colon cancer and the presence of a neoplastic growth in the descending colon may have led to bacteremia, which then seeded the heart valves, causing endocarditis.\n\nOption B, Treponema pallidum, is unlikely as the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of syphilis. Option C, Malignant colonic neoplasm, is related to the patient's underlying cancer, but it is not the direct cause of the cardiac findings. Option D, Collagen vascular disease, is not supported by the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings. Option E, Group D streptococci, is a less common cause of endocarditis, and the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with Viridans streptococci.",

Neurologic examination shows psychomotor agitation. Attention and concentration are impaired; she makes multiple errors while performing the serial sevens test. Her speech is disorganized. Her fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 122 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Perform lumbar puncture\nB. Check serum TSH level\nC. Check serum electrolytes\nD. Perform CT scan of the head\nE. Perform chest x-ray\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Check serum electrolytes.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as confusion, unusual behavior, and psychomotor agitation, are consistent with delirium. The fact that she has not been eating or drinking much for the past 6 days suggests that she may be dehydrated and have electrolyte imbalances, which can contribute to delirium. Hydrochlorothiazide, her medication for hypertension, can also cause electrolyte imbalances. Therefore, checking serum electrolytes is the most appropriate next step in management.\n\nWhile a lumbar puncture (A) may be necessary to rule out meningitis or encephalitis, it is not the most immediate concern given the patient's symptoms and physical examination. Checking serum TSH level (B) may be necessary to rule out hypothyroidism, but it is not the most urgent step. A CT scan of the head (D) may be necessary to rule out structural brain lesions, but it is not the most immediate concern. A chest x-ray (E) may be necessary to rule out pneumonia or other respiratory infections, but it is not the most urgent step.",

Add a sulfonylurea.\n\nThe patient's HbA1C is 8.5%, which indicates that his blood sugar control is not optimal, and his serum glucose is 240 mg/dL, which is above the target range. The patient is already on metformin, which is a first-line medication for type 2 diabetes, but it is not sufficient to control his blood sugar levels. Adding a sulfonylurea, which stimulates the release of insulin from the pancreas, is a reasonable next step to improve blood sugar control.\n\nStarting basal-bolus insulin (Option A) may be premature at this stage, as the patient's blood sugar levels are not severely uncontrolled. Continuing metformin monotherapy (Option B) is unlikely to improve the patient's blood sugar control.

CT studies of the brain were normal. The duty physician suspects the patient may be vitamin deficient. Which of the following reactions does the deficient vitamin mediate?\nOptions:\nA. Alpha-Ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA <=> Succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH\nB. Acetyl-CoA + Oxaloacetate + H2O <=> Citrate + CoA + H+\nC. Succinate + FAD (enzyme bound) <=> Fumarate + FADH2\nD.

Isocitrate + NAD+ <=> Alpha-Ketoglutarate + CO2 + NADH.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including severe retrograde memory loss, confusion, and confabulation, are consistent with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is caused by a deficiency of thiamine (Vitamin B1). Thiamine is a coenzyme for several enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, including transketolase and pyruvate dehydrogenase.\n\nThe reaction mediated by thiamine is the conversion of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate, which is catalyzed by the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase. This reaction is part of the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) and is essential for the production of energy in the form of ATP.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to thiamine deficiency:\n\nA. Alpha-Ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA <=> Succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH is the reaction catalyzed by alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, which requires coenzyme A and NAD+.\n\nB.

Approx. 1 month ago, he had a radical prostatectomy, pelvic radiation, and several rounds of chemotherapy for aggressive prostate cancer in Nicaragua and was discharged from the hospital with a suprapelvic catheter and a plan for more chemotherapy. He was coming to the United States to spend time with some extended family. According to the grand-daughter his mental status was altered upon arrival and his health began to decline. She is not aware of his past medical status or medications. At the hospital, his blood pressure is 98/60 mm Hg, the pulse id 110/min, the respiratory rate is 21/min, and the temperature is 35.6\u00b0C (96.1\u00b0F). On physical exam, the patient appears cachectic, drowsy, and only responds to questions by nodding his head. His heart rate is tachycardic with a regular rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The cystotomy incision for his suprapelvic catheter is red and swollen. The patient admitted to the hospital and stabilized and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The catheter tube produces no urine over 24 hours and only thick green-white puss can be expressed.

They range in age from 7 to 11, and most of them had no abnormal activities prior to developing the paralysis. These patients concern her because she has not seen this type of paralytic illness in over 20 years of practice. Based on this experience, she decides to write up the initial presentation and clinical course of these patients and publish them in a journal. Which of the following is most likely true about this study?\nOptions:\nA. Different interventions with 2 or more variables can be studied\nB. Hypothesis testing cannot be performed\nC. It should be reported in terms of odds ratio\nD. It should be reported in terms of relative risk\nE. Participants act as their own controls\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Hypothesis testing cannot be performed.\n\nThis study is a case series, which is a descriptive study that reports on a series of patients with a particular condition or outcome. The pediatrician is simply reporting on the characteristics and outcomes of the 9 patients who developed paralysis after a flu-like illness. There is no control group, and no intervention is being tested. Therefore, hypothesis testing, which requires a comparison between groups, cannot be performed.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. This study is not an experiment, so different interventions with 2 or more variables cannot be studied.\n\nC. Odds ratio is a measure of association used in case-control studies, which is not the design of this study.\n\nD. Relative risk is a measure of association used in cohort studies, which is also not the design of this study.\n\nE. Participants do not act as their own controls in a case series study, as there is no control group or comparison being made.",

He is unconscious upon arrival and is found to have severe internal bleeding due to trauma. He is taken for emergency surgery and severely damaged tissues are removed. After surgery, the boy is taken into the PICU for recovery. Over the subsequent week, serial labs are drawn showing target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. He is started on a prophylactic regimen that is continued upon discharge. Which of the following is consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed in this case?\nOptions:\nA. 30S ribosome inhibitor\nB. 50S ribosome inhibitor\nC. Cell wall cross-linking inhibitor\nD. DNA gyrase inhibitor\nE. Folate metabolism inhibitor\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Folate metabolism inhibitor.\n\nThe patient's lab results, including target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis, are consistent with a diagnosis of hypercoagulability due to trauma and tissue damage. The prophylactic regimen started in this case is likely to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is a common complication in trauma patients.\n\nThe most likely drug prescribed in this case is a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), which is a common prophylactic agent for VTE. However, the mechanism of action described in the options is not consistent with LMWH.\n\nThe correct answer is E. Folate metabolism inhibitor, which is the mechanism of action of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). TMP-SMX is often prescribed prophylactically in trauma patients to prevent pneumocystis pneumonia, which is a common complication in immunocompromised patients. The mechanism of action of TMP-SMX involves inhibiting folate metabolism, which is necessary for bacterial growth and proliferation.",

The symptoms include:\n\n* Frequent headaches and fatigue (suggesting a mass effect on the pituitary gland)\n* Weight gain despite a healthy diet (suggesting hypothyroidism)\n* Frequent urination (suggesting diabetes insipidus)\n* Nonpitting edema and decreased reflexes (suggesting hypothyroidism)\n* Papilledema and bitemporal hemianopsia (suggesting increased intracranial pressure)\n\nThe laboratory findings support this diagnosis, including:\n\n* Low sodium and potassium levels (suggesting adrenal insufficiency)\n* Low glucose level (suggesting hypoglycemia)\n* Low bicarbonate level (suggesting metabolic acidosis)\n* Low TSH and free T4 levels (suggesting hypothyroidism)\n\nSurgical resection of the pituitary tumor is the necessary treatment to relieve the compression on the pituitary gland and restore normal hormone production. Hormone replacement therapy may be necessary after surgery to replace deficient hormones.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1\u00df, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?\nOptions:\nA. A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1\u03b1, compared to a hypoxic control cell.\nB. A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1\u03b1, compared to a normoxic control cell.\nC. A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1\u03b1, compared to a hypoxic control cell.\nD. A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1\u03b1, compared to a normoxic control cell.\nE. A Western blot will show increased HIF-1\u03b1 compared to a normoxic control.\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. A Western blot will show increased HIF-1\u03b1 compared to a normoxic control.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* Northern blot detects RNA, and HIF-1\u03b1 is a protein, so options A and B are not relevant.\n* Southern blot detects DNA, and HIF-1\u03b1 is a protein, so options C and D are not relevant.\n* Western blot detects proteins, and since RCC inhibits HIF-1\u03b1 hydroxylation, allowing it to escape degradation, the researcher is likely to detect increased HIF-1\u03b1 protein in RCC under normoxic conditions compared to a normoxic control cell.",

If the drug is administered twice per day, which of the following dosages should be administered at each dosing interval to maintain a steady state?\nOptions:\nA. 270 mg\nB. 480 mg\nC. 135 mg\nD. 240 mg\nE. 540 mg\n\"\n\nResponse: To solve this problem, we can use the following formula:\n\nDose = (Target concentration x Clearance) / (Bioavailability x Frequency)\n\nGiven values:\nTarget concentration = 2 mg/L = 2,000 \u03bcg/L (since 1 mg = 1,000 \u03bcg)\nClearance = 15.0 L/h\nBioavailability = 75% = 0.75\nFrequency = 2 times per day\n\nFirst, we need to convert the clearance from L/h to L/dosing interval. Since the frequency is 2 times per day, the dosing interval is 12 hours. We can convert the clearance as follows:\n\nClearance (L/dosing interval) = 15.0 L/h x 12 h / 2 = 90 L/dosing interval\n\nNow, we can plug in the values:\n\nDose = (2,000 \u03bcg/L x 90 L/dosing interval) / (0.75 x 2)\nDose = 240,000 \u03bcg / 1.5\nDose = 160,000 \u03bcg\n\nSince the options are in milligrams, we need to convert the dose from micrograms to milligrams:\n\nDose (mg) = 160,000 \u03bcg / 1,000 \u03bcg/mg = 160 mg\n\nThe closest option to 160 mg is:\n\nD. 240 mg",

Prior to the onset of symptoms, he was seen playing with his mother\u2019s purse containing a bottle of vitamin supplements, which she takes for chronic microcytic anemia. Which of the following medications is the treatment for this patient's intoxication?\nOptions:\nA. Dimercaprol\nB. Penicillamine\nC. Deferoxamine\nD. Protamine\nE. Succimer\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Deferoxamine.\n\nThe symptoms described, including sudden abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and dark, almost black-colored stool, are consistent with iron poisoning. The fact that the child was playing with the mother's purse containing vitamin supplements, which she takes for chronic microcytic anemia, suggests that the child ingested iron supplements.\n\nDeferoxamine is a specific chelating agent used to treat iron poisoning. It binds to iron in the bloodstream, allowing it to be excreted in the urine, and is the treatment of choice for severe iron intoxication.",

He states that it started yesterday and has been progressively worsening. Initially, he noticed blurry vision and some trouble speaking and swallowing but thought he was just coming down with a cold. He then noticed weakness of his facial muscles and shortness of breath. The patient works as a farmer and harvests and cans his own foods. He has had diarrhea recently and a cough prior to these symptoms of weakness. His temperature is 97.9\u00b0F (36.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 144/94 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air.

Paramedics report extensive blood loss at the scene where he was found. Due to his Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, an endotracheal airway and large-bore access are secured prior to arrival. He is aggressively resuscitated with a massive transfusion protocol as the operating room is prepared for an exploratory laparotomy. An arterial line and central access are obtained. His temperature is 95\u00b0F (35\u00b0C), blood pressure is 50/40 mmHg, and pulse is 80/min, and respirations are controlled at 20/min on lung-protective volume control. After a 6:6:1 ratio of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets and the use of continuous phenylephrine infusion, the patient's vital signs remain the same.

Cervical spinal cord transection.\n\nThe patient's presentation is consistent with neurogenic shock, which is caused by a spinal cord injury. The clues that point to this diagnosis are:\n\n* The patient's Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, which indicates severe neurological impairment\n* The lack of tachycardia despite hypotension, which is unusual in the setting of hemorrhagic shock\n* The presence of cold extremities despite aggressive resuscitation and a warm ambient temperature\n* The low ScvO2 (central venous oxygen saturation) of 39%, which suggests inadequate tissue perfusion\n* The absence of active bleeding or other obvious causes of shock\n\nCervical spinal cord transection can cause neurogenic shock, which is characterized by hypotension, bradycardia, and decreased peripheral resistance. This is due to the disruption of sympathetic nervous system output, leading to unopposed parasympathetic activity. The patient's stab wounds may have caused a cervical spinal cord injury, leading to this presentation.",

Anti parvovirus B19 antibodies\nD. Bone marrow biopsy\nE. Liver function tests\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Eosin-5-maleimide binding test.\n\nThe patient's laboratory results and physical examination suggest a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis, a genetic disorder characterized by the production of abnormal red blood cells that are spherical in shape rather than the normal biconcave disk shape. The eosin-5-maleimide binding test is a diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis, which detects the presence of abnormal band 3 protein on the surface of red blood cells.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis:\n\nB. Flow cytometry for CD55/CD59 is used to diagnose paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a different hematological disorder.\n\nC. Anti-parvovirus B19 antibodies are used to diagnose parvovirus B19 infection, which can cause anemia and reticulocytosis, but is not related to hereditary spherocytosis.\n\nD. Bone marrow biopsy is not necessary for the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis and would not provide specific information about the disorder.\n\nE. Liver function tests may be abnormal due to the patient's underlying cholelithiasis, but are not related to the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis.",

The high serum IgM concentration (6.3 g/dL) is also characteristic of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.\n\nIgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a possible precursor to Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, but it is not typically associated with symptoms or anemia. Multiple myeloma is a possibility, but it is more commonly associated with bone lesions and lytic bone disease, which are not mentioned in this case. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are also possibilities, but they are less likely given the specific laboratory findings and symptoms described.",

She reports that the lump seemed to enlarge and became tender just preceding her last 2 menses. It is otherwise painless, and the patient denies any discharge or skin changes. She has no past medical history but her grandmother, age 72, was just diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The patient is an avid softball player at her high school and denies alcohol, smoking, or illicit drug use. On exam, the breasts appear symmetric and normal. A 3-cm round, mobile mass is palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There is slight tenderness to deep palpation of the mass. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy on either side. Which of the following is the most likely outcome of this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. This mass will likely require excision\nB.

The patient's symptoms, including right hand and leg weakness, disorientation, and positive Babinski reflex, are also consistent with a left middle cerebral artery stroke.\n\nLiquefactive necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in the brain, particularly in response to ischemia or infarction. It is characterized by the breakdown of brain tissue, leading to the formation of a liquid-filled cavity. This type of necrosis is commonly seen in cerebral infarctions, such as the one shown in the CT scan.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the pathology of a cerebral infarction:\n\nA. Gangrenous necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in response to ischemia, but it is typically seen in peripheral tissues, such as the limbs.\n\nC. Caseous necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in response to infection, particularly tuberculosis.\n\nD. Fibrinoid necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in response to immune-mediated injury, such as in autoimmune disorders.\n\nE. Coagulative necrosis is a type of necrosis that occurs in response to ischemia, but it is typically seen in solid organs, such as the liver or kidneys.",

The patient successfully underwent combined spinal-epidural anesthesia 1 hour ago. Her pregnancy was uncomplicated with the exception of a positive vaginal swab for group B streptococci 3 weeks ago, for which she received one dose of intravenous penicillin. Her temperature is 37.6\u00b0C (99.8\u00b0F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 70/30 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 82%. Physical examination shows labored breathing and thready pulses. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. The abdomen is nontender. Speculum examination shows pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 7.6 mg/dL and an undetectable fibrinogen concentration. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient\u2019s current condition?\nOptions:\nA. Apical ballooning of the left ventricle\nB.

Impaired tubal ciliary function will prevent natural fertilization\nD. The majority of patients become pregnant without medical assistance\nE. Functional gametes and the absence of a uterus make surrogacy necessary\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Pregnancy success rate with donor oocytes is similar to patients with primary ovarian failure.\n\nThe patient's physical characteristics, such as a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, a low posterior hairline, forearms angled away from the body, and shortened fourth metacarpals, are consistent with Turner syndrome. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females and is characterized by short stature, ovarian dysgenesis, and infertility.\n\nWomen with Turner syndrome are typically infertile due to ovarian failure, and their chances of conceiving naturally are very low. However, with the use of donor oocytes (eggs from a donor), they can achieve pregnancy through in vitro fertilization (IVF). The pregnancy success rate with donor oocytes is similar to that of patients with primary ovarian failure, which is around 50-60% per cycle.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n\nB. Administration of gonadotropins will not increase the chances of conceiving in a patient with Turner syndrome, as the ovaries are not functional.\n\nC. Impaired tubal ciliary function is not a characteristic of Turner syndrome, and it would not prevent natural fertilization in any case.\n\nD. The majority of patients with Turner syndrome do not become pregnant without medical assistance due to their infertility.\n\nE. Functional gametes (sperm or eggs) are not present in patients with Turner syndrome, and the absence of a uterus is not a characteristic of the syndrome.

Images and tissue samples are collected from 4 athletes with cartilaginous injury and 4 athletes with bone fractures. After 8 weeks, the athletes with bone fractures show almost complete resolution, while the athletes with cartilaginous injuries show only minimal signs of healing. The investigator hypothesizes that this is due to the absence of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration.

Following an extensive workup, you diagnose her with a duodenal ulcer secondary to H. pylori infection. You prescribe triple therapy of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of omeprazole?\nOptions:\nA. SST2 receptor agonist\nB. Parasympathetic inhibition\nC. Reversible block of H2 receptors\nD. Inhibition of primary active transport\nE. Inhibition of 50S ribosomal subunit\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Inhibition of primary active transport.\n\nOmeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), which works by inhibiting the primary active transport of hydrogen ions (H+) from the parietal cells of the stomach into the gastric lumen. This reduces the production of gastric acid, which helps to heal the duodenal ulcer and alleviate heartburn symptoms.\n\nHere's why the other options are incorrect:\n\nA. SST2 receptor agonist: Omeprazole is not an SST2 receptor agonist. SST2 receptors are involved in the regulation of gastric acid secretion, but omeprazole does not act on these receptors.\n\nB. Parasympathetic inhibition: Omeprazole does not inhibit parasympathetic activity. Parasympathetic stimulation can increase gastric acid secretion, but omeprazole's mechanism of action is independent of parasympathetic activity.\n\nC. Reversible block of H2 receptors: Omeprazole is not an H2 receptor antagonist. H2 receptor antagonists, such as ranitidine, work by blocking the action of histamine on parietal cells, reducing gastric acid secretion. Omeprazole, on the other hand, inhibits the proton pump directly.\n\nE. Inhibition of 50S ribosomal subunit: This is the mechanism of action of macrolide antibiotics, such as clarithromycin, which is part of the triple therapy regimen. Omeprazole does not inhibit the 50S ribosomal subunit.",

This patient's symptoms were most likely due to the effect of chemotherapy on which of the following structures?\nOptions:\nA. Vestibular nerve\nB. Intestinal smooth muscle\nC. Vagus nerve\nD. Cerebral cortex\nE. Area postrema\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Area postrema.\n\nEtoposide, a chemotherapeutic agent, can cause nausea and vomiting by stimulating the area postrema, also known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). The CTZ is a region in the brain that is sensitive to chemicals in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and it plays a key role in inducing vomiting in response to toxins. The CTZ is located in the floor of the fourth ventricle and is outside the blood-brain barrier, making it accessible to circulating toxins.\n\nMetoclopramide, an antiemetic medication, works by blocking the dopamine receptors in the CTZ, which helps to reduce nausea and vomiting.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the mechanism of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting:\n\nA. Vestibular nerve: involved in balance and equilibrium, not nausea and vomiting.\n\nB. Intestinal smooth muscle: involved in gut motility, not nausea and vomiting.\n\nC.

High BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, low potassium\nC. High BNP, high ADH, low sodium, low potassium\nD. Low BNP, high ADH, low sodium, low potassium\nE. Low BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, normal potassium\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. High BNP, high ADH, low sodium, low potassium.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* High BNP (Brain Natriuretic Peptide): The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings (shortness of breath, bilateral crackles, and bilateral pitting edema) suggest heart failure, which would increase BNP levels.\n* High ADH (Antidiuretic Hormone): The patient's symptoms and physical exam findings also suggest volume overload, which would stimulate the release of ADH to retain water and dilute sodium levels.\n* Low sodium: The patient's volume overload and heart failure would lead to dilutional hyponatremia (low sodium levels).\n* Low potassium: The patient's heart failure and diuretic use (although not mentioned, it's likely given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings) would lead to potassium depletion.\n\nThe other options do not fit the patient's presentation:\n\n* A: High potassium is unlikely in heart failure patients, especially with diuretic use.\n* B: Low ADH is unlikely in heart failure patients with volume overload.\n* D: Low BNP is unlikely in heart failure patients with symptoms and physical exam findings consistent with heart failure.\n* E: Low BNP and normal sodium and potassium levels do not fit the patient's presentation of heart failure and volume overload.",

He mentions that he has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain at the same location over the last 3 months and that these episodes usually occur after a heavy meal and subside within 1 or 2 hours. On physical examination, his temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. On examination of the abdomen, tenderness is present over the right upper quadrant; palpation over the area produces an inspiratory pause. An urgent bedside ultrasonogram shows a dilated common bile duct stone, but no stone in the common bile duct or in the gallbladder. Laboratory results show the following:\nHemoglobin 15.4 g/dL (9.56 mmol/L)\nTotal leukocyte count 14,000/mm3 (17.4 x 10*9/L)\nSegmented neutrophils 70%\nLymphocytes 25%\nMonocytes 4%\nEosinophils 1%\nBasophils 0%\nPlatelet count 32,0000/mm3 (320 x 10*9/L)\nSerum bilirubin (total) 1.8 mg/dL (30.78 \u03bcmol/L)\nSerum bilirubin (direct) 1.1 mg/dL (18.81 \u03bcmol/L)\nSerum alanine aminotransferase 96 U/L\nSerum aspartate aminotransferase 88 U/L\nSerum alkaline phosphatase\n350 U/L (5.83 \u03bckat/L)\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA.

Urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).\n\nThe patient presents with symptoms of cholangitis, including fever, right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice. The ultrasound shows a dilated common bile duct, suggesting a bile duct stone. The laboratory results show elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels, consistent with biliary obstruction.\n\nGiven the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform an urgent ERCP to remove the bile duct stone and relieve the biliary obstruction. This is a high-priority procedure to prevent further complications, such as sepsis and liver damage.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not indicated in this scenario, as the primary problem is a bile duct stone, not a gallbladder issue.\n\nB. and C. Medical management followed by elective cholecystectomy may be appropriate for patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis, but it is not the best option for this patient with cholangitis and a bile duct stone.\n\nE. Cholecystotomy is a surgical procedure that involves draining the gallbladder, but it is not the best option for this patient, as it does not address the bile duct stone and may not relieve the biliary obstruction.",

The patient refuses to answer any questions as he suspects that his care team is spying on him. The patient recently started college and has presented to the emergency department once before for polysubstance intoxication. The patient attempts to assault a nurse, is restrained, and given diphenhydramine and haloperidol. When the patient is able to be examined, he is somnolent and non-responsive. His temperature is 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C), blood pressure is 147/98 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. He does not comply with any commands, and it is not possible to freely manipulate his extremities due to rigidity. His mucous membranes are dry. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Catatonic schizophrenia\nB. Heat stroke\nC. Malignant hyperthermia\nD. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome\nE. Oversedation\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Heat stroke.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as undressing in hot weather, altered mental status, high body temperature (104\u00b0F), and dry mucous membranes, are consistent with heat stroke. The patient's rigidity and non-compliance with commands may be related to the heat stroke, rather than a primary neurological or psychiatric condition.\n\nWhile the patient has a history of substance abuse and may have been experiencing psychotic symptoms (paranoia, aggression), the primary diagnosis is likely heat stroke, which can cause altered mental status, rigidity, and autonomic instability.\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (D) is a possible complication of antipsychotic medication, but it is less likely in this scenario, given the patient's recent exposure to heat and lack of prior antipsychotic use. Malignant hyperthermia (C) is a rare genetic disorder that is typically triggered by certain medications or medical conditions, and is not a likely diagnosis in this case. Oversedation (E) is possible, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with heat stroke than oversedation. Catatonic schizophrenia (A) is a psychiatric condition that may present with rigidity and altered mental status, but it is less likely in this scenario, given the patient's recent exposure to heat and lack of prior psychiatric history.",

The patient complains of a headache and chest pain, and he has been vomiting for the last several hours. Physical exam demonstrates papilledema and a depressed level of consciousness. To treat this patient's hypertensive emergency, he is started on an IV medication commonly used in this situation. The agent exerts its effect by releasing nitric oxide as a metabolite, which subsequently activates guanylate cyclase and increases production of cGMP in vascular smooth muscle. Which of the following clinical effects would be expected from administration of this medication?\nOptions:\nA. Decreased cardiac contractility\nB. Increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure\nC. Decreased stroke volume\nD. Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure\nE. Increased systemic vascular resistance\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.\n\nThe medication being described is sodium nitroprusside, which is commonly used to treat hypertensive emergencies. It works by releasing nitric oxide, which activates guanylate cyclase and increases cGMP production in vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation.\n\nAs a result of vasodilation, sodium nitroprusside would be expected to decrease pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, which is a measure of left ventricular preload.

The peripheral blood smear shows spherocytes, which are characteristic of this condition. Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic disorder that affects the red blood cell membrane, leading to the production of abnormally shaped red blood cells that are prone to hemolysis.\n\nSplenic sequestration crisis is a complication of hereditary spherocytosis, particularly in children. It occurs when the spleen suddenly enlarges and traps large numbers of red blood cells, leading to a rapid drop in hemoglobin levels and potentially life-threatening anemia. This complication is more common in children under the age of 5 and can be triggered by viral infections, such as the upper respiratory tract infection the patient had a week prior to presentation.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:\n\nA. Malaria is a parasitic infection that can cause hemolytic anemia, but it is not a complication of hereditary spherocytosis.\n\nB. Acute myelogenous leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow, but it is not related to the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.\n\nC. Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, which is not a complication of hereditary spherocytosis.\n\nD. Renal papillary necrosis is a complication of sickle cell disease, not hereditary spherocytosis.",

She has been doing well in school and has no complaints. The patient has a past medical history of asthma which is controlled with albuterol. She is currently sexually active but states that she uses birth control. She has many friends and states that her mood is typically positive. The patient's last pap smear was 1 year ago. Her father died of colon cancer at the age of 68, and her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 65. Her temperature is 98.7\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 147/108 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's BMI is 19 kg/m^2. Physical exam demonstrates a normal S1 and S2, normal breath sounds, and an abdominal exam that is within normal limits. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Colonoscopy\nB. Discontinue birth control and place an intrauterine device\nC. Pap smear\nD. Pregnancy test\nE. Recommend weight loss\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Pregnancy test.\n\nThe patient's blood pressure reading of 147/108 mmHg is elevated, which is a concern. Before attributing it to any underlying medical condition, it's essential to rule out pregnancy, which can cause blood pressure changes. A pregnancy test is a necessary step to determine if the patient is pregnant, which could be contributing to her elevated blood pressure.",

She has also had watery diarrhea for several days with no blood or pus in the stools. She is taking an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication, which she cannot remember the name of, and drinking oral rehydration solution, which has helped a little. Her past medical history shows she was hospitalized 10 years ago for an appendectomy and 4 years ago for a fractured ulna following a motor vehicle accident. Vital signs are pulse is 104/min, blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 14/min with shallow breathing, and temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F). On physical examination, pupils are constricted. Extremities are pale and cold. The abdomen is soft but mildly, diffusely tender to palpation with a palpable bladder. No rebound or guarding. Fingerstick blood glucose is 124 mg/dL. Laboratory tests are pending. A urinary catheter is placed, and intravenous fluids are started. Abdominal imaging shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Administer naloxone\nB. Administer opioid analgesics\nC. Scopolamine patch\nD. Start dextrose infusion\nE. Perform a gastric lavage\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Administer naloxone.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as constricted pupils, pale and cold extremities, and shallow breathing, suggest opioid toxicity. The fact that she is taking an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication that she cannot remember the name of, and has a history of recent diarrhea, suggests that she may have taken loperamide, an opioid-based anti-diarrheal medication. Loperamide can cause opioid toxicity in large doses. Administering naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is the next best step in management to reverse the opioid toxicity.",

Surgery is performed under general anesthesia for which the patient is intubated with an endotracheal tube. Directly following the procedure, his temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. He is extubated as soon as he showed signs of alertness. Five minutes later, he becomes unresponsive. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. He underwent stenting of the right coronary artery 10 years ago. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 2 weeks ago for surgery. He drinks one to two beers daily. His current medications include metformin, enalapril, aspirin, atorvastatin, and a multivitamin. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 73%.

The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.32, indicating respiratory acidosis, and a PO2 of 73 mm Hg, indicating hypoxemia. These findings suggest that the patient is not getting enough oxygen and is at risk of respiratory failure.\n\nReintubation is the best next step in management to secure the airway and provide mechanical ventilation to improve oxygenation and ventilation. This will help to correct the respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Performing a tracheostomy is not indicated at this time, as the patient's airway is not compromised, and reintubation is a more immediate solution.\n\nB. Continuing to use the non-rebreather mask is not sufficient, as the patient is still hypoxemic and unresponsive.\n\nD. Close observation only is not appropriate, as the patient's condition is critical and requires immediate intervention.\n\nE. Starting BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) may be considered in some cases of respiratory failure, but it is not the best option in this scenario, as the patient is unresponsive and requires more aggressive management.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: An 11-month-old male infant is brought to his pediatrician by his mother. She is concerned about his leg and his inability to stand. He was born vaginally to a 33-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) from an uncomplicated pregnancy at 39 weeks. He has met all developmental milestones and is up to date on all vaccinations. His mother explains that he can normally stand without help and can walk briefly on his own. However, he hit his right leg against a chair 2 days ago. The area became edematous and bruised overtime and the infant became unable to stand or crawl and cries when he puts weight on it. The mother denies any child abuse from her family or child care. The patient\u2019s vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 137/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 36.7\u00b0C (97.0\u00b0F). His length and weight are both between the 15th and 25th percentile. On physical examination, blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae are noted. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits for his age. There is joint hypermobility and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities. The patient\u2019s right calf appears slightly deformed, edematous, and warm to the tough. The patient begins to cry loudly when the physician palpates his leg. The patient\u2019s X-ray shows an incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis. What is the most likely cause of the patient\u2019s symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Child abuse\nB. Insufficient production of procollagen type 1\nC. Mutation in the gene encoding fibrillin-1\nD. Defective collagen type 3\nE. Dysfunctional structure of laminins\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Insufficient production of procollagen type 1.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae, joint hypermobility, and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities, are consistent with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones and other connective tissue abnormalities. The incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis is also consistent with OI.\n\nOI is caused by mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, which code for procollagen type 1, a critical component of bone collagen. The insufficient production of procollagen type 1 leads to brittle bones that are prone to fracture.\n\nChild abuse (option A) is unlikely given the mother's denial and the presence of other symptoms consistent with OI. Marfan syndrome (option C) is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue, but it is not typically associated with brittle bones or osteogenesis imperfecta. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (option D) is a group of disorders that affect connective tissue, but it is not typically associated with brittle bones or osteogenesis imperfecta. Laminins (option E) are a type of protein that play a role in the structure of basement membranes, but they are not directly related to osteogenesis imperfecta.",

He appears very distressed. He is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 92 kg (203 lb); BMI is 30.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a tender and mildly swollen left lower leg; dorsiflexion of the left foot causes severe pain in the calf. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 184,000/mm3, a prothrombin time of 11 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 26 seconds, and positive fibrin split products. Ultrasonography of the left leg shows incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow.

Antiphospholipid syndrome\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Factor V Leiden.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including severe pain and swelling in the left lower leg, are consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The ultrasonography findings of incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow also support this diagnosis.\n\nThe patient's family history of pulmonary embolism and his personal history of smoking increase his risk for thrombosis. The laboratory results, including a normal platelet count, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time, suggest that the patient does not have a bleeding disorder or a severe coagulopathy.\n\nThe presence of fibrin split products indicates that the patient has an ongoing thrombotic process. The patient's response to unfractionated heparin, as evidenced by the prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, suggests that the thrombosis is likely due to a genetic or acquired thrombophilia.\n\nFactor V Leiden is a common genetic mutation that increases the risk of thrombosis. It is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms, given his age, family history, and response to heparin.",

On physical examination, a mild conjunctival pallor is evident, and the rectum is erythematous, indurated, and tender. Colonoscopy demonstrates continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon. What is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Ulcerative colitis\nB. Celiac disease\nC. Irritable bowel syndrome\nD. Crohn\u2019s disease\nE. Laxative abuse\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Ulcerative colitis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, cramping, grossly bloody stool, and an urge to defecate, are consistent with inflammatory bowel disease. The presence of continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon on colonoscopy also supports this diagnosis. Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that typically affects the rectum and colon, causing inflammation and ulceration of the mucosa.\n\nWhile the patient's history of bulimia and laxative abuse may have contributed to their symptoms, it is not the primary cause of their current condition. Crohn's disease (option D) is also a type of inflammatory bowel disease, but it typically affects the entire gastrointestinal tract, not just the colon and rectum. Celiac disease (option B) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the small intestine, and irritable bowel syndrome (option C) is a functional disorder that does not typically cause bloody stools or mucosal lesions. Laxative abuse (option E) may have contributed to the patient's symptoms, but it is not the primary diagnosis.",

He has been evaluated by several practitioners, who have all prescribed antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, with no improvement and leading to emotional distress and sleep disturbances. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for a mildly tender prostate, without masses or nodules. There are no testicular masses, hernias, or hemorrhoids. Additionally to this health issue, you have also been following him for recurrent abdominal pain, periods of constipation and diarrhea, and fatigability, with all test results within the normal range thus far. A summary of recent tests is shown in the following table:\nUrine test\nSample White cells Culture\nMid-stream urine Negative Negative\nExpressed prostatic secretion Positive Negative\nWhat is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Benign prostatic hyperplasia\nB. Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis\nC. Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis\nD. Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli\nE. Interstitial cystitis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including pelvic pain, irritative voiding symptoms, and painful ejaculation, are consistent with prostatitis. The presence of white cells in the expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) suggests inflammation, but the negative culture results rule out bacterial infection. The lack of response to antimicrobial therapy and the absence of any other identifiable cause of the symptoms support the diagnosis of chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis.\n\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (A) is unlikely to cause the patient's symptoms, particularly the painful ejaculation and hematospermia. Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis (C) is possible, but the patient's symptoms have been present for 2 years, making acute infection less likely. Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli (D) is also unlikely, given the negative culture results. Interstitial cystitis (E) may cause similar symptoms, but the presence of white cells in the EPS and the patient's other symptoms make prostatitis a more likely diagnosis.",

He states that 2 weeks ago, he had a fever, chills, and a cough, which his primary doctor treated with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and rest. Since then, the patient\u2019s symptoms have resolved with the exception of a chronic cough and a small amount of clear sputum that is occasionally laced with blood. The patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, or chills. The patient is otherwise healthy and is currently taking metformin and albuterol. His temperature is 98.3\u00b0F (36.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 129/75 mmHg, pulse is 84/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for bilateral clear breath sounds, absence of lymphadenopathy on HEENT exam, and a normal oropharynx. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Chest radiograph\nB. CT angiogram\nC. D-dimer\nD. Sputum culture\nE. Supportive care\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Chest radiograph.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of a chronic cough with occasional blood-tinged sputum after a recent respiratory illness suggest the possibility of a pulmonary process, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. A chest radiograph is a non-invasive and relatively inexpensive test that can help evaluate the lungs and identify any abnormalities, such as infiltrates, nodules, or effusions. It is a reasonable next step in management to further evaluate the patient's symptoms and guide further testing or treatment.\n\nCT angiogram (Option B) is not necessary at this point, as it is a more advanced imaging study that is typically reserved for evaluating more complex or severe pulmonary conditions, such as pulmonary embolism.\n\nD-dimer (Option C) is a test that is used to evaluate for pulmonary embolism, but it is not indicated in this patient who does not have symptoms or signs of pulmonary embolism.\n\nSputum culture (Option D) may be useful in identifying the cause of the patient's cough, but it is not the best next step in management. The patient's symptoms are not severe, and the sputum is clear, which makes it less likely that the patient has a bacterial infection that would require antibiotic treatment.\n\nSupportive care (Option E) may be necessary, but it is not the best next step in management. The patient's symptoms need to be further evaluated to determine the underlying cause, and a chest radiograph is a reasonable test to start with.",

Menses had previously occurred at irregular 15\u201345 day intervals with moderate to heavy flow. Menarche was at the age of 14 years. She started having sexual intercourse with her boyfriend about 3 months ago. Six months ago she had a manic episode, which was treated with risperidone. Her mother has PCOS and her father has diabetes mellitus. She is very conscious of her weight and appearance. She is 171 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (174 lb); BMI is 27.02 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 60/min, and blood pressure is 116/70 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Pelvic examination shows a normal vagina and cervix. Serum hormone studies show:\nProlactin 16 ng/mL\nThyroid-stimulating hormone 3.8 \u03bcU/mL\nFollicle-stimulating hormone 6 mIU/mL\nLuteinizing hormone 5.1 mIU/mL\nProgesterone 0.8 ng/mL (follicular N <3; luteal N >3\u20135)\nTestosterone 2.2 nmol/L (N <3.5)\nA urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms?\"\nOptions:\nA. Uterine fibroids\nB. Congenital defect of the Mullerian ducts\nC. Purging behavior\nD. Polycystic ovaries\nE. Anovulation\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Anovulation.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of irregular menses, moderate to heavy flow, and recent amenorrhea (no menstrual bleeding for 3 months) suggest anovulation, which is a common cause of menstrual irregularities in adolescents. The hormone studies support this diagnosis, as the FSH and LH levels are within normal ranges, but the progesterone level is low, indicating that ovulation is not occurring.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and hormone studies:\n\nA. Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that can cause heavy menstrual bleeding, but they are not typically associated with amenorrhea.\n\nB. Congenital defects of the Mullerian ducts would likely cause more severe menstrual irregularities and may be associated with other genital tract abnormalities, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.\n\nC. Purging behavior, such as in eating disorders, can cause menstrual irregularities, but the patient's BMI is 27, which suggests that she may be overweight, but not underweight, which is more commonly associated with eating disorders.\n\nD. Polycystic ovaries (PCOS) are a possibility, given the patient's family history and symptoms, but the hormone studies do not support this diagnosis, as the testosterone level is within normal range, and the LH:FSH ratio is not elevated, which is typically seen in PCOS.",

She is a student who exercises and eats a well-balanced diet every day. There is no family history of hypertension or other metabolic syndromes. On examination, her blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg, respirations are 19/min, pulse is 64/min, and temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98.0\u00b0F). An echocardiogram is ordered for investigation. This patient is likely affected by a condition which is associated with which of the following options?\nOptions:\nA. Fibromuscular dysplasia\nB. Marfan syndrome\nC. Turner syndrome\nD. Pheochromocytoma\nE. Takayasu's arteritis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Pheochromocytoma.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as sudden onset of high blood pressure, facial flushing, and cold intolerance (using blankets to cover her feet despite warm temperatures), are consistent with a pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that produces excess catecholamines, leading to hypertension and other symptoms. The echocardiogram is likely ordered to rule out any cardiac complications of hypertension.",

Bleomycin is a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used to treat testicular cancer, and it is known to cause pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial lung disease. The fine inspiratory crackles, clubbing, and CT scan findings are all consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nThe pulmonary function tests (PFTs) showing a reduced FVC and a normal FEV1/FVC ratio also support this diagnosis, as bleomycin-induced lung toxicity typically causes a restrictive pattern of lung disease.\n\nThe other options are not typically associated with this type of lung toxicity:\n\n* Carboplatin and cisplatin are platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents that can cause nephrotoxicity and other side effects, but they are not typically associated with pulmonary fibrosis.\n* Ifosfamide is an alkylating agent that can cause pulmonary edema and other side effects, but it is not typically associated with interstitial lung disease.\n* Methotrexate is an antimetabolite that can cause pulmonary toxicity, but it is more commonly associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) rather than interstitial lung disease.",

On admission, a complete blood count showed a hemoglobin concentration of 15.5 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 14,000/mm3. Urinalysis showed 2+ proteinuria, and serum studies showed a blood glucose of 145 mg/dL and a creatinine concentration of 1.2 mg/dL. A CT scan of the abdomen confirmed the diagnosis. Therapy with intravenous ketoprofen, piperacillin, and tazobactam was begun, and the patient was placed on bowel rest. He has a history of hypertension, chronic constipation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin, metoprolol, and losartan. Today, his temperature is 37.7\u00b0C (99.9\u00b0F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 135/87 mm Hg.

Dehydration.\n\nThe patient's history of bowel rest, lack of oral intake, and use of ketoprofen (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) suggest that dehydration is the most likely cause of the patient's acute kidney injury. The patient's creatinine level increased from 1.2 mg/dL to 2.9 mg/dL over a short period of time, which is consistent with prerenal azotemia. Additionally, the patient's physical examination findings, such as a soft abdomen and tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant, do not suggest a postrenal cause of kidney injury.",

She drinks alcohol moderately. Her mother had a fracture of the wrist when she was in her late 60s. The physical examination shows no abnormal findings. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA scan) shows a T-score of -3.2 standard deviations (SDs) in the hip. The patient is educated regarding her risk of falls. Exercise regimen and smoking cessation assistance are provided. Appropriate diet is indicated, as well as supplements with calcium and vitamin D. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy?\nOptions:\nA. Alendronate\nB. Calcitonin\nC. Estrogen\nD. Tamoxifen\nE. No pharmacotherapy at this time\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Alendronate.\n\nThe patient has a T-score of -3.2 standard deviations (SDs) in the hip, which indicates severe osteoporosis. Given her history of Colles' fracture, sedentary lifestyle, and smoking, she is at high risk for future fractures. The most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy would be to initiate bisphosphonate therapy, specifically alendronate, to reduce her risk of fractures. Alendronate is a commonly used medication for the treatment of osteoporosis, and it has been shown to reduce the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 33-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 26 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department because of frequent contractions. The contractions last 40 seconds, occur every 2 minutes, and are increasing in intensity. She has a history of recurrent painful ulcers on her vulva, but she currently does not have them. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a non-reassuring fetal heart rate. Her current medications include acyclovir, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), heart rate is 88/min, and blood pressure is 126/76 mm Hg. Contractions are felt on the abdomen. The cervix is dilated to 5 cm, 70% effaced, and the station of the head is -2. A fetal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Allow vaginal delivery\nB. Initiate misoprostol therapy\nC. Initiate nifedipine therapy\nD. Perform cesarean delivery\nE. Perform dilation and evacuation\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Allow vaginal delivery.\n\nThe patient is presenting with frequent contractions and is already 5 cm dilated, which indicates that labor is progressing. Given her history of a previous cesarean section, a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) is a viable option. The patient's current condition and fetal ultrasound results do not indicate any complications that would require a cesarean delivery. Therefore, allowing vaginal delivery is the most appropriate next step in management.\n\nMisoprostol therapy (Option B) is not indicated in this scenario, as it is typically used to induce labor, which is already progressing. Nifedipine therapy (Option C) is used to tocolyze (stop) contractions, which is not necessary in this case. Performing a cesarean delivery (Option D) is not necessary at this point, as the patient is a good candidate for VBAC. Dilation and evacuation (Option E) is not relevant in this scenario, as it is a procedure typically used for pregnancy termination, not for managing labor.",

He reports using extra pillows at night to sleep and two nighttime awakenings to catch his breath in the last month. The patient lives in a homeless shelter and has not seen a doctor in the last 20 years. He has been drinking 5-8 drinks of alcohol per day for the last 20 years. Family history is non-significant, and the patient does not take any medications. His temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F), blood pressure is 135/115 mm Hg, pulse is 85/min, and respiratory rate is 24/min. Physical examination reveals 2+ bilateral pitting edema. Chest auscultation reveals bibasilar crackles. Which of the following is associated with this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)\nB. Decreased vascular smooth muscle tone\nC. Decreased extracellular fluid (ECF) volume\nD. Increased renal blood flow\nE. Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest heart failure, likely due to long-standing hypertension and alcohol abuse. The presence of bibasilar crackles, bilateral pitting edema, and exertional dyspnea are all consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nIn heart failure, the body's response to decreased cardiac output is to increase sodium retention, which leads to increased extracellular fluid volume and edema. This is achieved through the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which stimulates the kidneys to reabsorb more sodium and water. Therefore, option E, increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption, is associated with this patient's condition.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to this patient's condition:\n\nA. Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) may occur in heart failure, but it is not a primary mechanism driving the patient's symptoms.\n\nB. Decreased vascular smooth muscle tone is not typically associated with heart failure.\n\nC. Decreased extracellular fluid (ECF) volume is the opposite of what is seen in heart failure, where ECF volume is increased due to sodium retention.\n\nD. Increased renal blood flow is not a characteristic of heart failure, and may even be decreased in some cases due to decreased cardiac output.",

The patient has no past medical history and takes no prescription medications. He does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. The patient\u2019s vitals are currently within normal limits. On examination, the physician notices 2 clean puncture wounds with localized cellulitis. Capillary refill is 2 seconds. Sensorimotor evaluation of the hand is without deficits. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment choice for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Amoxicillin\nB. Amoxicillin-clavulanate\nC. Clindamycin\nD. Doxycycline\nE. Azithromycin\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Amoxicillin-clavulanate.\n\nThe patient has been bitten by a stray dog and has localized cellulitis, which suggests a bacterial infection. The most common bacteria that cause dog bite infections are Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus species. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers these bacteria and is the recommended treatment for dog bite wounds. It is also effective against anaerobic bacteria that may be present in the wound.\n\nAmoxicillin alone (Option A) may not be effective against P. multocida, which is a common cause of dog bite infections. Clindamycin (Option C) is not a good choice because it does not cover P. multocida and may not be effective against Streptococcus species. Doxycycline (Option D) is not typically used for dog bite infections, and azithromycin (Option E) may not be effective against anaerobic bacteria.",

Scurvy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Kwashiorkor.\n\nThe symptoms described, such as pitting edema, abdominal swelling, ascites, and hepatomegaly, are consistent with kwashiorkor, a form of protein-energy malnutrition. The presence of edema, particularly in the ankles and feet, is a hallmark of kwashiorkor. The patient's irritability and difficulty arousing are also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nMarasmus (option B) is another form of protein-energy malnutrition, but it typically presents with wasting and emaciation, rather than edema.\n\nBeriberi (option C) is a condition caused by thiamine deficiency, and it can cause edema, but it is typically seen in the context of a diet heavily reliant on polished rice.\n\nRickets (option D) is a condition caused by vitamin D deficiency, and it typically presents with skeletal deformities, rather than edema and abdominal swelling.\n\nScurvy (option E) is a condition caused by vitamin C deficiency, and it typically presents with bleeding gums, joint pain, and poor wound healing, rather than edema and abdominal swelling.\n\nThe patient's history of displacement, inadequate nutrition, and housing also support the diagnosis of kwashiorkor.",

Since his 18-month visit, the parents have become concerned that his speech does not seem to be developing appropriately. The parents report that the patient\u2019s vocabulary is still limited to fewer than 10 words, and he is still only using single words to describe things. The parents say that his motor milestones do not seem to be affected, as the patient is very physically active and can run and kick a ball. At times the patient seems hyperactive and can be difficult to redirect. On exam, his temperature is 98.4\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 14/min. The rest of the exam is unremarkable, except that the patient\u2019s face appears to be abnormally long and narrow.

Autosomal dominant.\n\nThe symptoms described, including delayed speech development, hyperactivity, and a long and narrow face, are consistent with Fragile X syndrome, a trinucleotide repeat disorder. Fragile X syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is enough to cause the condition.",

She has no complaints and offers very little information voluntarily. She answers each question with soft, short sentences and avoids eye contact. She appears timid, anxious and admits that this is one of the very few times she has left the house in the last several years. Medical history is significant for essential hypertension. She takes hydrochlorothiazide and a daily vitamin. She has worked from home as a web graphic designer for 20 years. Questions about her social life reveal that she is very shy with few friends, and she often makes excuses to avoid parties and social gatherings.

The boy had seemingly opened several different pill bottles that were in a cabinet in his parent\u2019s bathroom. The mother has brought the empty bottles to the emergency room, and they include aspirin, metoprolol, acetaminophen, levothyroxine, and lorazepam.

Acetaminophen overdose can cause a metabolic acidosis, which is characterized by a low pH and a low bicarbonate level.\n\nOption B is the only choice that reflects a metabolic acidosis, with a pH of 7.35 (slightly acidic) and a bicarbonate level of 15 mEq/L (low). The PCO2 of 29 mmHg is consistent with a respiratory compensation for the metabolic acidosis.\n\nThe other options do not reflect a metabolic acidosis and are therefore less likely to be correct.",

She is 13 weeks pregnant based on the date of her last menstrual period. She is dizzy and weak, and is unable to move around the house and perform her daily tasks. Initially, she had only light spotting, but later on in the day the bleeding increased. Thus far, she has used six sanitary pads. The blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, the temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), the pulse is 125/min, and the respiratory rate is 14/min. A saline infusion is started, and blood and urine specimens are sent for analysis. On pelvic examination, the vagina contains blood and the cervical os is open. She also complains of cervical motion and adnexal tenderness on examination. An ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac low in the uterine cavity. No fetal movement or cardiac activity are observed. She is advised to rest for a couple of hours, after which the scan is repeated. Slight downward migration of the gestational sac is observed with no change in the fetal status. Which of the following is the next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Antibiotics\nB. Bed rest and analgesics\nC. Magnesium sulfate\nD. Methotrexate\nE. Dilation and curettage\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Dilation and curettage.\n\nThe patient is experiencing profuse bleeding and is hemodynamically unstable, with a low blood pressure and tachycardia. The ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac low in the uterine cavity, but no fetal movement or cardiac activity, suggesting a non-viable pregnancy. The downward migration of the gestational sac on repeat scan suggests that the pregnancy is likely to be an incomplete abortion.\n\nGiven the patient's unstable condition and the likelihood of an incomplete abortion, the next step in management is to perform a dilation and curettage (D&C) to evacuate the uterus and control the bleeding. This is a surgical procedure that involves dilating the cervix and using a curette to remove the pregnancy tissue from the uterus.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Antibiotics are not indicated in this scenario, as there is no evidence of infection.\n\nB. Bed rest and analgesics may be used to manage the patient's symptoms, but they do not address the underlying issue of the incomplete abortion.\n\nC. Magnesium sulfate is not indicated in this scenario, as it is typically used to prevent seizures in patients with preeclampsia.\n\nD. Methotrexate is a medication used to terminate an ectopic pregnancy, but it is not indicated in this scenario, as the pregnancy is intrauterine and non-viable.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.\nMethods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.\nResults: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.\nConclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.\nIf the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?\nOptions:\nA. Measurement bias\nB. Recall bias\nC. Lead-time bias\nD. Selection bias\nE. Length-time bias\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Lead-time bias.\n\nLead-time bias occurs when a screening test or diagnostic method appears to improve outcomes because it detects a condition earlier, but the earlier detection does not actually change the natural course of the disease. In this case, if the conclusion that initial ultrasonography is associated with better outcomes is due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point-of-care ultrasound, it would be an example of lead-time bias. The earlier detection of nephrolithiasis may not actually change the outcome, but it would make it seem like the ultrasonography group has better outcomes because the condition was detected earlier.",

The pain is recurrent and occurs when she exerts herself or when she is outside during cold weather. She also experiences shortness of breath and palpitations during these episodes. The symptoms resolve spontaneously when she stops or sits down for a while. Over the past few days, the episodes have increased in frequency. She has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. Her left leg was amputated below the knee after a motorcycle accident 25 years ago. She is currently waiting for a new prosthesis and walks with crutches. Current medications include captopril, glyburide, and ibuprofen. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her pulse is 88/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 144/90 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm without any signs of ischemia. Serum cardiac markers are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress\nB. Upper endoscopy\nC. Coronary angiography\nD. Echocardiography at rest\nE. Repeat ECG under treadmill stress\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with angina pectoris, which is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen-rich blood. The pain is triggered by exertion and relieved by rest, which is a classic pattern of angina. The patient's risk factors, such as hypertension and diabetes, also support this diagnosis.\n\nA myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress is a non-invasive test that can help diagnose coronary artery disease, which is the underlying cause of angina. The test involves injecting a small amount of radioactive material into the bloodstream, which allows areas of the heart with reduced blood flow to be identified. Pharmacological stress, such as with dipyridamole or adenosine, is used to mimic the effects of exercise on the heart.\n\nOption B, upper endoscopy, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms and would not be a useful diagnostic test in this case. Option C, coronary angiography, is an invasive test that may be necessary if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, but it is not the next step in diagnosis. Option D, echocardiography at rest, may be useful in evaluating the patient's cardiac function, but it would not provide information about coronary artery disease or myocardial perfusion. Option E, repeat ECG under treadmill stress, may be useful in diagnosing coronary artery disease, but it is not as sensitive or specific as a myocardial perfusion scan.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 30-year-old female presents to her primary care provider complaining of 4 days of fever, malaise, dyspnea, and productive cough and has recently developed pleuritic chest pain. Her past medical history is notable for asthma and takes albuterol as needed. She does not smoke but drinks alcohol socially. Her family history is notable for cystic fibrosis in her paternal uncle and interstitial lung disease in her paternal grandfather. Her temperature is 101\u00b0F (38.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 21/min. Rales are noted in the right lower lung, and a chest radiograph demonstrates focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe. After initiating the appropriate treatment, she agrees to take part in a study assessing the immune response to lung infections. A protein is identified in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition. An amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated and a fluorescent marker is added to the sequence. This labeled sequence is subsequently added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient\u2019s own neutrophils and macrophages and subsequently labeled with another fluorescent marker. The sequence binds strongly to this protein as evidenced by increased fluorescence in the gel. What process does this sequence typically undergo in immunocompetent individuals?\nOptions:\nA. Affinity maturation\nB. Random assortment\nC. Random nucleotide addition\nD. VDJ recombination\nE. Isotype switching\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. VDJ recombination.\n\nThe protein identified in the patient's serum is likely an antibody, and the amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus is likely the antigen-binding region. The fact that it binds strongly to a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient's own neutrophils and macrophages suggests that it is an antibody that recognizes a specific antigen.\n\nVDJ recombination is the process by which the immune system generates diversity in the antigen-binding regions of antibodies. It involves the random rearrangement of gene segments (V, D, and J) to create a unique antigen-binding region. This process occurs in immunocompetent individuals and is essential for generating a diverse repertoire of antibodies that can recognize and respond to a wide range of antigens.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the process described:\n\nA. Affinity maturation is the process by which antibodies increase their binding affinity for an antigen over time, but it is not directly related to the generation of antibody diversity.\n\nB. Random assortment is not a recognized immunological process.\n\nC. Random nucleotide addition is not a process that occurs in antibody generation.\n\nE. Isotype switching is the process by which an antibody changes its isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG), but it is not directly related to the generation of antibody diversity.",

Effect of low temperature on muscle proteins\nD. Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling\nE. Depletion of intracellular calcium\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling.\n\nRigidity, also known as rigor mortis, is a post-mortem phenomenon characterized by stiffness of the muscles. It occurs due to the depletion of ATP in the muscles, which leads to the inhibition of cross-bridge cycling between actin and myosin filaments. As a result, the muscles become locked in a rigid state.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the development of rigor mortis:\n\nA. Neurotoxins can cause muscle weakness or paralysis, but they do not directly contribute to rigor mortis.\n\nB.

The pain is worse after standing a lot at work and when she climbs stairs. There is no history of trauma. She has hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. Her mother died of metastatic breast cancer 15 years ago, at the age of 65 years. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Current medications include atorvastatin, labetalol, and aspirin. Over the past 2 months, she has been taking over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed for the joint pain. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 84 kg (185 lb); BMI is 31.8 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 114/68 mm Hg.

Joint effusion and pannus on ultrasound\nE. Fluid-filled pouch on ultrasound\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA) of the left knee. The presence of tenderness on palpation of the anteromedial joint line, crepitus, and pain with full flexion and extension are all characteristic of OA. The patient's age, BMI, and lack of trauma history also support this diagnosis.\n\nOsteophytes (bone spurs) and joint-space narrowing are common radiographic findings in OA, which is why option A is the most likely finding on imaging of the left knee.\n\nOption B is more consistent with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (CPPD), which is a different type of arthritis.\n\nOption C is more consistent with a bone tumor or metastatic disease, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.\n\nOption D is more consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.\n\nOption E is more consistent with a Baker's cyst, which is a fluid-filled pouch that can occur in the context of OA, but is not the most likely finding in this case.",

Four months ago, he had an episode of severe joint pain involving his left knee that lasted several days and resolved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has a history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide and nephrolithiasis. Examination shows erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the right metatarsophalangeal joint; range of movement is limited by pain. His serum uric acid is 12 mg/dL. Arthrocentesis yields cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 18,500/mm3 (80% segmented neutrophils). Polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid is shown.

Inhibition of phospholipase A\nC. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase\nD. Increased renal excretion of urate\nE. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of gout, a type of inflammatory arthritis caused by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints. The polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid shows negatively birefringent crystals, which is characteristic of uric acid crystals.\n\nThe most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for gout is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, such as allopurinol. Xanthine oxidase is an enzyme that converts hypoxanthine to xanthine and then to uric acid. By inhibiting xanthine oxidase, allopurinol reduces the production of uric acid and helps to prevent the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. Increased conversion of uric acid to allantoin is the mechanism of action of rasburicase, a uricolytic agent used to treat tumor lysis syndrome, not gout.\n\nB. Inhibition of phospholipase A is the mechanism of action of certain anti-inflammatory drugs, but it is not relevant to the treatment of gout.\n\nD. Increased renal excretion of urate is the mechanism of action of uricosuric agents, such as probenecid, which are used to treat gout, but they are not the most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient.\n\nE. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase is the mechanism of action of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are used to treat the acute symptoms of gout, but they are not a long-term treatment for the condition.",

Since the initiation of therapy, the growth of the cancerous tissue has slowed. This medication is known to be excreted by the kidneys at the current dose that he is taking. The patient has no significant complaints, except for excessive sweating at times. On physical examination, a small area of tissue around his nipples is enlarged bilaterally. No other abnormal findings are present. Which of the following drugs most likely belongs to be the same class as drug X?\nOptions:\nA. Leuprolide\nB. Finasteride\nC. Flutamide\nD. Terazosin\nE. Anastrozole\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Flutamide.\n\nThe description of the medication (drug X) suggests that it is an androgen receptor antagonist, which blocks the action of testosterone. Flutamide is a non-steroidal antiandrogen that works by binding to androgen receptors, thereby blocking the action of testosterone. It is used to treat prostate cancer, which is consistent with the patient's diagnosis.\n\nLeuprolide (A) is a GnRH agonist that reduces testosterone levels by suppressing the production of luteinizing hormone.\n\nFinasteride (B) is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor that reduces the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, but it does not directly block androgen receptors.\n\nTerazosin (D) is an alpha-1 blocker used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and hypertension, but it is not an androgen receptor antagonist.\n\nAnastrozole (E) is an aromatase inhibitor that reduces estrogen levels, but it is not an androgen receptor antagonist.",

He reports pain with climbing stairs and with extended walks of greater than 100 yards. The pain worsens with activity throughout the day and is alleviated by periods of rest. He states that he has minimal morning stiffness, lasting approximately 5-10 minutes after waking up most days. Physical examination reveals tenderness to palpation of the bony structures on the medial aspect of the bilateral knees as well as crepitus and a decreased range of motion, limited at the extremes of flexion and extension. Both knee joints are cool to touch and exhibit bony enlargement upon palpation of the medial joint line. Which of the following studies would be indicated for further work-up of this patient's presenting condition?\nOptions:\nA. Complete blood count (CBC)\nB. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)\nC. Rheumatoid factor (RF)\nD. MRI of the knee\nE. No further work-up needed\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. No further work-up needed.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knees. The presence of bilateral knee pain, worsened by activity and relieved by rest, is typical of OA. The physical examination findings of tenderness to palpation of the bony structures, crepitus, and decreased range of motion are also consistent with OA. The absence of morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes and the lack of warmth or redness in the joints make it unlikely that the patient has an inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nGiven the classic presentation of OA, no further work-up is needed to establish the diagnosis. Imaging studies such as X-rays or MRI may be useful in confirming the diagnosis and assessing the severity of the disease, but they are not necessary in this case. Laboratory tests such as a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and rheumatoid factor (RF) are not indicated, as they would not change the management of the patient's condition.",

Increased complement component 3\nD. Increased prothrombin time\nE. Decreased gamma globulin\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Increased platelet count.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The rash on the cheeks that spares the nasolabial folds is a classic finding in SLE, known as a \"butterfly rash.\" The oral ulcers are also a common feature of SLE.\n\nIn SLE, the immune system is overactive, leading to inflammation and tissue damage.

Increased complement component 3 is not a characteristic finding in SLE. In fact, complement levels are often decreased in SLE due to consumption of complement proteins in the inflammatory process.\n* D. Increased prothrombin time is not a typical finding in SLE, and would suggest a bleeding disorder rather than an autoimmune disease.\n* E. Decreased gamma globulin is not a characteristic finding in SLE. In fact, many patients with SLE have elevated levels of gamma globulin due to the production of autoantibodies.",

Increase in capillary pressure\nB. Decrease in plasma proteins\nC. Increase in capillary permeability\nD. Increase in colloid osmotic pressure\nE. Increase in interstitial fluid pressure\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Increase in capillary pressure.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as dyspnea on exertion, elevated JVP, and bilateral lower extremity edema, are consistent with heart failure. In heart failure, the heart is unable to pump effectively, leading to increased pressure in the veins and capillaries. This increased pressure pushes fluid out of the capillaries and into the interstitial space, causing edema.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:\n\nB. Decrease in plasma proteins would lead to a decrease in colloid osmotic pressure, which would also cause edema, but it is not the most likely explanation in this case.\n\nC. Increase in capillary permeability would allow more fluid to leak out of the capillaries, but it is not the primary cause of edema in this patient.\n\nD. Increase in colloid osmotic pressure would actually decrease edema, as it would pull fluid back into the capillaries.\n\nE. Increase in interstitial fluid pressure is a result of edema, not a cause of it.",

Rasburicase.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle cramps, are likely due to hyperuricemia (elevated uric acid levels) and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), a complication of cancer treatment. The laboratory results show elevated uric acid levels (11.2 mg/dL) and other electrolyte abnormalities consistent with TLS.\n\nRasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase that converts uric acid to allantoin, a more soluble and easily excreted compound. It is commonly used to prevent and treat TLS in patients with high-risk malignancies, such as acute myelogenous leukemia. Administering rasburicase prior to chemotherapy would have been the most effective way to prevent the patient's current symptoms.\n\nUrine alkalinization (A) may help increase uric acid excretion, but it is not as effective as rasburicase in preventing TLS. Corticosteroids (B) are not typically used to prevent TLS. Allopurinol (D) is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that can reduce uric acid production, but it takes several days to be effective and may not prevent TLS. Intravenous hydration (E) is important in preventing TLS, but it is not as effective as rasburicase in preventing the symptoms.",

She feels well but asks for advice about smoking cessation. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 7 years. She has tried to quit several times without success. During the previous attempts, she has been extremely nervous and also gained weight. She has also tried nicotine lozenges but stopped taking them because of severe headaches and insomnia. She has bulimia nervosa. She takes no medications. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Diazepam\nB. Nicotine patch\nC. Varenicline\nD. Motivational interviewing\nE. Fluoxetine\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Motivational interviewing.\n\nThe patient has a history of smoking and has tried to quit several times without success. She has also experienced side effects from nicotine lozenges and has bulimia nervosa. Given her complex medical and psychological history, the most appropriate next step would be to start with motivational interviewing to assess her readiness to quit smoking and to identify the barriers that have prevented her from quitting in the past. This approach would help to build her motivation and confidence to quit smoking, and then other evidence-based treatments such as nicotine replacement therapy or prescription medications like varenicline could be considered.\n\nDiazepam (A) is not an appropriate choice for smoking cessation, and it may even be contraindicated in a patient with bulimia nervosa due to the risk of dependence and abuse. Nicotine patch (B) may be a useful treatment for smoking cessation, but it would not be the first step in this patient's management given her history of side effects from nicotine lozenges. Varenicline (C) is a prescription medication that can be effective for smoking cessation, but it may not be the best choice for this patient given her history of bulimia nervosa and the potential for psychiatric side effects. Fluoxetine (E) is an antidepressant that may be used to treat bulimia nervosa, but it is not a treatment for smoking cessation.",

His personal history is significant for a myocardial infarction 6 years ago that required revascularization and hypertension. His medication consists of simvastatin and lisinopril.  In the ED, he has a blood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, a pulse of 88/min, a respiratory rate of 28/min, and a temperature of 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F). On physical examination, he has jugular vein distention, displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), an S4-gallop, a holosystolic murmur, and 2+ pitting edema up to the mid calf.  He is started on furosemide, carvedilol, and oxygen therapy. After 6-hours of continued therapy, his blood pressure remains low, and his serum creatinine is found to be 1.9 mg/dL. Which of the following test would be more useful to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease?\nOptions:\nA. Sulfosalicylic acid test\nB. Urine sodium content\nC. Fractional excretion of sodium Na+ (FENa+)\nD. Fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea)\nE. Nitrates in urine\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea).\n\nThe patient's presentation is consistent with heart failure, and the low blood pressure and elevated serum creatinine suggest possible acute kidney injury (AKI). The differential diagnosis includes prerenal AKI (due to decreased perfusion of the kidneys) versus intrinsic AKI (due to kidney damage).\n\nThe fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) is a useful test to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic AKI. FEUrea is calculated as the ratio of urea clearance to creatinine clearance. In prerenal AKI, the FEUrea is typically low (<35-40%), indicating that the kidneys are conserving urea in response to decreased perfusion. In intrinsic AKI, the FEUrea is typically high (>50-60%), indicating that the kidneys are not able to conserve urea due to damage.\n\nThe other options are not as useful in differentiating between prerenal and intrinsic AKI:\n\nA. Sulfosalicylic acid test is used to detect proteinuria, which is not specific to AKI.\n\nB. Urine sodium content can be low in both prerenal and intrinsic AKI.\n\nC. Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa+) can be low in prerenal AKI, but it can also be low in some cases of intrinsic AKI, such as acute tubular necrosis.\n\nE.

Normally, glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal renal tubules through secondary active transport, a process that involves the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2). However, when blood glucose levels are high, the capacity of SGLT2 to reabsorb glucose is exceeded, resulting in glucosuria.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. Yeast metabolism does not contribute to glucosuria.\n\nB. Primary active transport is not directly involved in glucose reabsorption in the renal tubules.\n\nD. Passive transport is not the primary mechanism of glucose reabsorption in the renal tubules.\n\nE. An increased glomerular filtration rate would not directly cause glucosuria.",

The patient reports that about 4 weeks ago he developed a \u201cnagging\u201d headache. He thought he had a cold, so he tried over the counter ibuprofen that provided only mild and temporary relief. Recently, he also started feeling dizzy and nauseous, which only resolves when he steps outside to shovel the snow. The patient\u2019s medical history is significant for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and asthma. His medications include amlodipine, metformin, glimepiride, and a fluticasone/salmeterol inhaler. The patient has been living at his upstate cabin for the past 5 weeks but denies other recent travel. He denies smoking tobacco or illicit drug use. The patient\u2019s temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/78 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 16/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is currently asymptomatic while sitting in the office, and physical examination is unremarkable. Labs are drawn, as shown below:\n\nHemoglobin: 20 g/dL\nHematocrit: 60%\nLeukocyte count: 10,050 cells/mm^3 with normal differential\nPlatelet count: 350,000/mm^3\n\nWhich of the following underlies the patient\u2019s most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Medication side effect\nB. Myeloproliferative neoplasm\nC. Neuronal hyperexcitability\nD. Toxic exposure\nE. Viral infection\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Toxic exposure.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of headache and dizziness, which resolve when he steps outside, suggest carbon monoxide poisoning. The laboratory results showing elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are also consistent with this diagnosis, as carbon monoxide can cause an increase in red blood cell production. The patient's history of living in a cabin for 5 weeks and using a furnace or other fuel-burning appliances increases the likelihood of carbon monoxide exposure.",

At that time, she was acutely severely manic and was brought to the emergency department by her concerned boyfriend. She was started on lithium, and after subsequent improvement, she was discharged. A week after discharge, the patient forgot to take her medication for a few days and quickly began to manifest manic symptoms again which required brought her to the emergency department again. Since then, she has been compliant with her medications and currently has no significant complaints. Which of the following recommendations would be most helpful in minimizing the risk to the fetus in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Adjust dosage of medication throughout the pregnancy\nB. Supplement all patients with 5mg of daily folic acid\nC. Low-dose polytherapy is preferred over monotherapy\nD. Discontinue the medication when conception is confirmed\nE. Switch to valproate as it has safest pregnancy profile\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Supplement all patients with 5mg of daily folic acid.\n\nThe patient is a 20-year-old woman with bipolar I disorder, and the question is asking about minimizing the risk to the fetus. This implies that the patient is planning to become pregnant or is already pregnant. Lithium, the medication she is taking, is known to have potential teratogenic effects, particularly in the first trimester.\n\nSupplementing with folic acid is a standard recommendation for all women of childbearing age, especially those taking medications that may increase the risk of birth defects. Folic acid has been shown to reduce the risk of neural tube defects, which are a concern with certain medications used to treat bipolar disorder.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. Adjusting the dosage of medication throughout pregnancy may be necessary, but it is not the most important recommendation for minimizing the risk to the fetus.\n\nC. Low-dose polytherapy is not necessarily preferred over monotherapy in pregnancy, and the safest approach would depend on the individual patient's needs and medication regimen.\n\nD. Discontinuing the medication when conception is confirmed is not a recommended approach, as it may lead to a relapse of symptoms and potentially harm the mother and fetus.\n\nE. Valproate is not considered to have the safest pregnancy profile, and it is actually known to have a higher risk of birth defects compared to other mood stabilizers.",

She states that her symptoms have progressed and she now feels feverish as well. She also notes an episode of nonbloody diarrhea 2 days ago and has been increasingly nauseous. While being evaluated in the emergency room, she vomits three times. The patient has no significant past medical history but was recently treated with ciprofloxacin for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection. She also notes irregular periods, with a last menstrual period 6 weeks ago. She is a college student who has had 3 sexual partners in the last year with inconsistent use of barrier protection. Her temperature is 100.5\u00b0C (38.1\u00b0F), blood pressure is 102/68 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, and respirations are 14/min. On exam, the patient is noticeably uncomfortable. There is marked tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic region and right lower quadrant, with voluntary guarding but no rebound. Pelvic exam shows moderate purulent discharge in the vaginal vault, cervical motion tenderness, and a tender adnexal mass on the right side. Which of the following is the best next step in treating this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline with outpatient follow-up\nB. Intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline with inpatient admission\nC. Oral vancomycin with outpatient follow-up\nD. Methotrexate with outpatient follow-up\nE. Exploratory laparotomy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline with inpatient admission.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is a serious infection of the female reproductive organs. The patient's recent treatment with ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection may have contributed to the development of PID by altering the normal vaginal flora.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including fever, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, suggest a more severe infection that requires inpatient admission and intravenous antibiotics. The presence of a tender adnexal mass on the right side also suggests a tubo-ovarian abscess, which is a complication of PID that requires more aggressive treatment.\n\nIntravenous cefotetan and doxycycline are appropriate antibiotics for the treatment of PID, and inpatient admission is necessary to monitor the patient's response to treatment and to provide supportive care.\n\nOption A is incorrect because outpatient treatment with oral antibiotics is not sufficient for a patient with severe symptoms and a tubo-ovarian abscess. Option C is incorrect because vancomycin is not typically used to treat PID. Option D is incorrect because methotrexate is not an antibiotic and is not used to treat PID. Option E is incorrect because exploratory laparotomy is not necessary at this point, and antibiotic treatment should be tried first.",

She complains of vomiting and complete hearing loss in her left ear. The patient believes she had an ear infection in the same ear but never sought out treatment. She has a past medical history of uterine fibroids. She takes mifepristone daily to reduce the size of the fibroids. Her blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg, the heart rate is 68/min, the respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F). The patient appears pale and in mild distress. Otoscopy reveals a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane is observed to be immobile as confirmed by the pneumatoscope. Pure-tone audiometry testing reveals hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear. Heart auscultation is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Nystagmus is positive to the right. MRI of the brain does not reveal a tumor or abscess. Her physician orders a complete blood count with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel, which show:\nHemoglobin 14.5 gm/dL\nHematocrit 43.2 %\nWhite blood cells 14,500 /mm3\nPlatelets 312,000/mm3\nNeutrophil 81.6%\nLymphocyte 15.2%\nMonocyte 1.4%\nEosinophil 1.2%\nBasophil 0.6%\nSerum Na+ 138 mEq/L\nK+ 4.3 mEq/L\nCl- 108 mmol/L\nBUN 12 mg/dL\nCreatinine 0.8 mg/dL\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Ofloxacin\nB. Cefepime\nC. Cefotaxime\nD. Amoxicillin\nE. Cephalexin\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Cefotaxime.\n\nThe patient presents with symptoms of vertigo, vomiting, and complete hearing loss in the left ear, which suggests a diagnosis of labyrinthitis or otitis media with labyrinthine involvement. The otoscopy findings of a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane and immobility of the tympanic membrane confirm the diagnosis of otitis media.\n\nGiven the patient's history of uterine fibroids and daily use of mifepristone, it is likely that she has a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, which is a common pathogen in otitis media. Cefotaxime is a third-generation cephalosporin that has good coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, making it the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient.\n\nOfloxacin (A) is a fluoroquinolone that is not typically used as a first-line agent for otitis media, and it may not have adequate coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefepime (B) is a fourth-generation cephalosporin that has good coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it is typically reserved for more severe infections or those that are resistant to other antibiotics. Amoxicillin (D) is a penicillin antibiotic that is not effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cephalexin (E) is a first-generation cephalosporin that is not effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",

Upon initial presentation to the hospital\u2019s emergency department, he was diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and treated with alteplase. He has been under close observation since then. The patient now describes discomfort in his chest and left shoulder, somewhat similar in nature to what initially brought him into the hospital. A pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and a blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg are observed. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings.

The analgesic spray she used did not provide adequate relief. There is no family history of serious illness. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive pill. Her immunizations are up-to-date. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37.1\u00b0C (99\u00b0F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg. Examination shows a swollen and tender left wrist; range of motion is limited.

The tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox and decreased grip strength support this diagnosis. Although the initial X-rays do not show any abnormalities, scaphoid fractures can be difficult to diagnose on initial radiographs.\n\nThe most appropriate next step is to immobilize the wrist in a thumb spica cast and repeat the X-rays in 2 weeks. This allows for further evaluation and potential diagnosis of a scaphoid fracture, which may become more apparent on follow-up radiographs.\n\nOpen reduction and internal fixation (A) and percutaneous pinning (E) are not indicated at this stage, as the diagnosis is not yet confirmed. Corticosteroid injections (B) are not typically used for acute fractures. Rest, ice, and repeat X-rays in 2 weeks (D) may not provide adequate immobilization and may delay diagnosis and treatment.",

This finding is often referred to as \"onion skin\" fibrosis due to the concentric layers of fibrosis surrounding the bile ducts.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nB. Periportal lymphocytic infiltration and piecemeal necrosis are more characteristic of chronic hepatitis, such as autoimmune hepatitis.\n\nC. Diffuse fibrosis with PAS-staining globules is more characteristic of glycogen storage diseases, such as von Gierke disease.\n\nD. Irregular ductal glands lined by atypical and pleomorphic cells are more characteristic of cholangiocarcinoma, a malignant tumor of the bile ducts.\n\nE. Ductopenia and fibrotic degeneration of periportal hepatocytes are more characteristic of vanishing bile duct syndrome, a rare condition characterized by the loss of intrahepatic bile ducts.",

She first noticed the lesion 3 days ago. The patient describes the lesion as painful and swollen. She denies vaginal discharge. Her past medical history is notable for mild intermittent asthma, gout, and obesity. She uses an albuterol inhaler as needed and takes allopurinol. She has had 5 sexual partners in the past year and uses the pull-out method for contraception. She has a 10-pack-year smoking history and drinks 10-12 alcoholic beverages per week. On exam, she has an ulcerated, tender, and purulent ulcer on the left labia majora. The patient has mild unilateral painful inguinal lymphadenopathy.

He mentions that lately, he has been feeling increasingly restless and is unable to control feelings of nervousness pertaining to all his daily tasks. He noticed that these feelings were more prominent in the last 2 months but have been present on and off for the last year. On many occasions, his mind will be racing with thoughts that keep him up at night. During these moments, he finds his heart racing and feels light-headed and dizzy to the point of blacking out. He has also been experiencing back and neck pain with increased muscle tension in these areas. The patient reports no smoking or alcohol use but mentions that he had tried cocaine and heroin in his 20s and 30s. Which of the following would be the best course of treatment for this patient\u2019s symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Diazepam\nB. Zolpidem\nC. Ramelteon\nD. Buspirone\nE. Alprazolam\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Buspirone.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including feelings of nervousness and anxiety, restlessness, racing thoughts, and physical symptoms such as heart racing, lightheadedness, and muscle tension, are consistent with a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).\n\nBuspirone is a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic that is commonly used to treat GAD. It has a slower onset of action compared to benzodiazepines, but it is less likely to cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms.\n\nDiazepam (A) and alprazolam (E) are benzodiazepines that can be effective for anxiety, but they have a higher risk of dependence and withdrawal symptoms, especially in older adults.\n\nZolpidem (B) is a sedative-hypnotic that is used to treat insomnia, but it is not typically used to treat anxiety.\n\nRamelteon (C) is a melatonin receptor agonist that is used to treat insomnia, but it is not typically used to treat anxiety.\n\nIt's worth noting that the patient's history of substance abuse in the past may make benzodiazepines a less desirable option, as they can be habit-forming. Buspirone is a safer choice in this case.",

Dilatation and evacuation (D&E).\n\nThe patient is 5 weeks pregnant, and the most appropriate method for elective termination of pregnancy at this gestational age is dilatation and evacuation (D&E). D&E is a surgical procedure that involves dilating the cervix and using suction or forceps to remove the pregnancy tissue from the uterus. It is a safe and effective method for terminating pregnancies up to 12-14 weeks of gestation.\n\nManual uterine aspiration (option C) is also a possible option, but it is typically used for earlier pregnancies (up to 6-7 weeks). Dilatation and curettage (D&C) after vacuum evacuation (option D) is not necessary in this case, as D&E is a more straightforward and effective procedure.

He reports that over the past month he has become more easily \u201cwinded\" to the point that he now sleeps in his living room because he can\u2019t make it up the stairs. A review of systems is notable for headaches and fatigue. On physical exam you note decreased breath sounds and a dullness to percussion on the right. A chest radiograph is obtained, which shows a right-sided pleural effusion. Thoracocentesis is performed and the fluid is analyzed, with results shown below:\n\nVolume: 30 cc of fluid\nPleural fluid protein: 5.8 g/dL\nSerum protein ratio: 7.0 g/dL\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 258 U/L\n\nWhich of the following conditions may have led to the findings in this patient\u2019s pleural cavity?\nOptions:\nA. Congestive heart failure\nB. Hypoalbuminemia\nC. Liver cirrhosis\nD. Lymphoma\nE. Nephrotic syndrome\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Congestive heart failure.\n\nThe pleural fluid analysis results are consistent with a transudative effusion, which is typically caused by increased hydrostatic pressure or decreased oncotic pressure. The key findings are:\n\n* Pleural fluid protein: 5.8 g/dL (normal < 3.0 g/dL)\n* Serum protein ratio: 7.0 g/dL (normal > 0.5)\n* LDH: 258 U/L (normal < 200 U/L)\n\nThese results suggest that the effusion is caused by increased hydrostatic pressure, which is consistent with congestive heart failure. The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and orthopnea (sleeping in the living room due to difficulty climbing stairs) also support this diagnosis.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the pleural fluid analysis results:\n\n* B. Hypoalbuminemia would cause a low serum protein level, but the pleural fluid protein level would be low as well.\n* C. Liver cirrhosis would cause a high pleural fluid protein level and a low serum protein level.\n* D. Lymphoma would typically cause an exudative effusion with a high LDH level and a high pleural fluid protein level.\n* E. Nephrotic syndrome would cause a low serum protein level, but the pleural fluid protein level would be low as well.",

Hysterosalpingogram.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, including a firm, asymmetric uterus, suggest a possible uterine anomaly or fibroids, which could be contributing to her recurrent pregnancy losses. A hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is a diagnostic test that uses X-ray and contrast dye to visualize the uterus and fallopian tubes, and is often used to evaluate uterine abnormalities and tubal patency. It is the most likely test to elucidate the cause of this patient's pregnancy losses.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings:\n\nA. Anti-cardiolipin antibodies are associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, which can cause recurrent pregnancy loss, but there is no indication of this in the patient's history or lab results.\n\nB. Karyotyping is used to evaluate chromosomal abnormalities, but there is no indication of this in the patient's history or lab results.\n\nD.

She has suffered from seasonal allergies for the past 2 years and takes diphenhydramine as needed when her symptoms worsen. She has not yet seen a physician for her allergies. She reports that diphenhydramine has been helpful in controlling her symptoms, but she does not like feeling drowsy from the medication. Her past medical history is also notable for well-controlled asthma. She uses an albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis. She smokes marijuana daily. Her temperature is 99.2\u00b0F (37.3\u00b0C), blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 16/min. She has a prominent nasal crease. Her nasal turbinates are boggy and bluish-gray. She has copious thin and watery nasal mucus. The physician suggests replacing diphenhydramine with fexofenadine to improve her drowsiness. What characteristic of fexodenadine allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine?\nOptions:\nA. Alpha-adrenergic antagonism\nB. Beta-adrenergic antagonism\nC. Muscarinic antagonism\nD. Relative lipophobicity\nE. Serotonergic antagonism\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Relative lipophobicity.\n\nFexofenadine is a non-sedating antihistamine, which means it is less likely to cause drowsiness compared to diphenhydramine. This is due to its relative lipophobicity, which refers to its low ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. As a result, fexofenadine has a lower affinity for the central nervous system and is less likely to cause sedation.\n\nDiphenhydramine, on the other hand, is a lipophilic antihistamine, which means it can easily cross the blood-brain barrier and cause sedation.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. Alpha-adrenergic antagonism is not related to sedation.\n\nB. Beta-adrenergic antagonism is not related to sedation.\n\nC. Muscarinic antagonism is not related to sedation.\n\nE. Serotonergic antagonism is not related to sedation.",

Sublingual atropine drops.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including incomprehensible speech, drooling, and excessive tearing, are consistent with organophosphate poisoning, which is a common hazard in agricultural settings.

A type 1 error has been made.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The researcher rejects the null hypothesis with a p-value of 0.049, which is just below the significance level of 0.05. This means that there is a 4.9% chance of observing the result (or a more extreme result) assuming that the null hypothesis is true.\n* Since the p-value is close to the significance level, there is a possibility that the researcher has made a type 1 error, which is the error of rejecting a true null hypothesis.\n* The other options are not correct:\n\t+ A. The confidence interval of 95% is appropriate for this study, and changing it to 90% would not affect the conclusion.\n\t+ B. A type 2 error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis) is still possible in this case, even though the null hypothesis was rejected.\n\t+ C. The null hypothesis was rejected based on the p-value, so it should be rejected.\n\t+ D. There is no evidence to suggest that a type 2 error has been made, as the null hypothesis was rejected.",

The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but the patient often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. CT scan of the abdomen\nB. Transabdominal ultrasonography\nC. Barium enema\nD. Anorectal manometry\nE. Rectal suction biopsy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Rectal suction biopsy.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Hirschsprung's disease, a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon. The explosive release of stool from the rectum during the rectal exam is a classic finding in Hirschsprung's disease.\n\nA rectal suction biopsy is the most definitive diagnostic test for Hirschsprung's disease, as it allows for the examination of the rectal mucosa and submucosa for the presence or absence of ganglion cells. The biopsy can be performed at the bedside and is a relatively simple and safe procedure.\n\nThe other options are not as specific or diagnostic for Hirschsprung's disease:\n\nA. CT scan of the abdomen: May show nonspecific findings such as bowel dilation, but is not diagnostic for Hirschsprung's disease.\n\nB. Transabdominal ultrasonography: May show bowel dilation, but is not specific for Hirschsprung's disease.\n\nC. Barium enema: May show a transition zone between the dilated and non-dilated colon, but is not as sensitive or specific as a rectal suction biopsy.\n\nD.

The pain radiates to his left shoulder and is associated with sweating. The past medical history is significant for hypercholesterolemia, for which he takes lovastatin. He smoked as a youth but quit at 40 years of age. On arrival at the emergency department, the vital signs were as follows: pulse 58/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and blood pressure 90/56 mm Hg. He is sweating profusely. The jugular venous pulse is visible 2.5 cm above the sternal angle. Auscultation reveals soft S1 and S2 heart sounds with an added S4 and bilateral inspiratory crackles at the lung bases. The electrocardiogram shows ST-elevations in leads V1 and V2. A diagnosis of an anteroseptal infarction is made. The patient was given aspirin on the way to the hospital. He is started on dopamine, morphine, nitroglycerin, and streptokinase. Which of the following would be the most concerning development over the next 24h this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Hemoptysis\nB. Easy fatigability\nC. Persistent ST-segment elevation\nD. Persistent inspiratory crackles\nE. Shortness of breath\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Persistent ST-segment elevation.\n\nThe patient has been diagnosed with an anteroseptal infarction and has been started on streptokinase, a thrombolytic agent. The goal of thrombolytic therapy is to restore blood flow to the affected area of the heart and reduce the size of the infarct. Persistent ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram would indicate that the thrombolytic therapy has not been effective in restoring blood flow, and the infarct is continuing to evolve. This would be a concerning development, as it would suggest that the patient is at higher risk for further complications, such as cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even death.\n\nThe other options are not as concerning:\n\nA. Hemoptysis (coughing up blood) is a possible side effect of thrombolytic therapy, but it is not a specific complication of anteroseptal infarction.\n\nB. Easy fatigability is a common symptom in patients with heart failure, but it is not a specific complication of anteroseptal infarction.\n\nD. Persistent inspiratory crackles may indicate pulmonary edema, which is a possible complication of anteroseptal infarction, but it is not as concerning as persistent ST-segment elevation.\n\nE. Shortness of breath is a common symptom in patients with heart failure, but it is not a specific complication of anteroseptal infarction.",

The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol consumption, or illicit drug use. No significant family history. His vital signs include: blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg without postural changes, pulse 92/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0\u2103 (98.6\u2109). Physical examination reveals a poorly groomed, disheveled, thin man. He is irritable, paranoid, and delusional but denies any hallucinations. An unstable, wide-based ataxic gait is noted.

The laboratory results, including a low hemoglobin level, high MCV, and hypersegmented neutrophils on the peripheral blood smear, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's behavioral changes, such as irritability, paranoia, and delusions, are common neuropsychiatric manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\nWhile folate deficiency (option B) can also cause similar hematological abnormalities, it is less likely to cause the neuropsychiatric symptoms and ataxic gait seen in this patient. Pernicious anemia (option E) is a type of vitamin B12 deficiency caused by a lack of intrinsic factor, but the absence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies makes this diagnosis less likely. Hypothyroidism (option A) and parvovirus infection (option D) are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.",

He has recently migrated from Sweden and has not had any checkups in the last 3 years. He first started having back pain 3 years ago, but his pain has begun to be excruciating in the mornings. He is no longer able to get relief with over the counter medications. He also feels stiff every morning and this usually lasts between 30 minutes and an hour. Both of his knees are also very painful, particularly upon standing up from a seated position. His pain improves when he moves around, so he tries to be somewhat physically active. He also reports that he cannot use his hands for long periods of time due to joint pain and stiffness. His father and sister also have joint issues, and his mother was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis. He has been a smoker for 13 years. Upon physical examination, his wrist and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are warm and swollen. Which of the following is the next best step in management?\nOptions:\nA.

Synovial fluid aspiration\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Testing for serum ESR and autoantibodies.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as morning stiffness, joint pain and swelling, and improvement with physical activity, are consistent with inflammatory arthritis, particularly rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The presence of a family history of joint issues and osteoporosis also supports this diagnosis. The next step in management would be to order laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (anti-CCP).\n\nOption A is incorrect because while calcium and PTH levels may be relevant in the context of osteoporosis, they are not directly related to the patient's current symptoms.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while calcium and vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial for the patient's overall bone health, it is not the next best step in managing his current symptoms.\n\nOption D is incorrect because ferritin levels are not directly related to the patient's symptoms, and testing for ferritin would not be a priority at this stage.\n\nOption E is incorrect because while synovial fluid aspiration may be useful in diagnosing certain conditions, such as septic arthritis, it is not the next best step in managing this patient's symptoms.",

She has recently avoided drinking alcohol and eating spicy food because it worsens her diarrhea and causes episodes of heart palpitations and reddening of the face and neck. She takes lisinopril for hypertension. Her temperature is 36.5\u00b0C (97.7\u00b0F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 149/90 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft, and there is mild tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. Laboratory studies show an increased urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration. Further evaluation of this patient will most likely show which of the following?\nOptions:\nA. Proximal muscle wasting\nB. Achlorhydria\nC. Adrenal medullary mass\nD. Multiple peptic ulcers\nE. Pulmonic valve stenosis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Achlorhydria.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and flushing, are consistent with carcinoid syndrome, which is caused by a neuroendocrine tumor that secretes serotonin and other vasoactive substances. The increased urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentration supports this diagnosis, as 5-HIAA is a metabolite of serotonin.\n\nAchlorhydria, or the absence of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, is a common finding in patients with carcinoid syndrome, as the tumor can cause atrophic gastritis and reduce gastric acid production.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to carcinoid syndrome:\n\nA. Proximal muscle wasting is more commonly associated with muscular dystrophy or other neuromuscular disorders.\n\nC. Adrenal medullary mass is more commonly associated with pheochromocytoma, a different type of neuroendocrine tumor.\n\nD. Multiple peptic ulcers are more commonly associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, a condition caused by a gastrin-secreting tumor.\n\nE.

His cough has been increasing in frequency and severity over the course of 3 days, and his sputum production has increased in volume. The color of his sputum is yellow-green. He denies any chest pain or palpitations but has experienced worsening shortness of breath with exertion and at rest, which is above his baseline. He has not noticed any changes in his weight or edema in his lower extremities. He denies any recent history of long travel. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been hospitalized four times for similar symptoms within the last year. He has smoked approximately 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 45 years. His temperature is 102\u00b0F (38.9\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/94 mmHg, pulse is 101/min, and respirations are 26/min with an oxygen saturation of 85% on room air. On physical exam, the patient has difficulty speaking, and there is asynchronous motion between the chest and abdomen with respiration. Wheezing is appreciated on pulmonary auscultation. An ECG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm. A chest radiograph is obtained, and he is administered supplemental oxygen. He is started on ipratropium, albuterol, and methylprednisolone. Which of the following should be added to this patient's treatment regimen?\nOptions:\nA. Amoxicillin\nB. Cefazolin\nC. Ceftriaxone\nD. Levofloxacin\nE. Penicillin\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Levofloxacin.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are consistent with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The yellow-green color of his sputum suggests a bacterial infection, and the patient's history of frequent hospitalizations for similar symptoms suggests that he may have a more resistant bacterial infection.\n\nLevofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is commonly used to treat bacterial exacerbations of COPD, particularly those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common pathogen in patients with COPD. It has good coverage against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, making it a good choice for this patient.\n\nAmoxicillin (Option A) is a penicillin-type antibiotic that may not have adequate coverage against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefazolin (Option B) is a first-generation cephalosporin that is not typically used to treat COPD exacerbations. Ceftriaxone (Option C) is a third-generation cephalosporin that may be used to treat COPD exacerbations, but it is typically reserved for more severe infections or those that are resistant to other antibiotics. Penicillin (Option E) is not typically used to treat COPD exacerbations, as it has limited coverage against Gram-negative bacteria.",

Exophthalmos.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, and tachycardia, are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The presence of thyroglobulin-stimulating immunoglobulins suggests Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism. The edema and waxy discoloration in the legs are likely due to pretibial myxedema, a skin condition that can occur in Graves' disease.\n\nExophthalmos, or bulging eyes, is a common feature of Graves' disease, particularly in patients with thyroglobulin-stimulating immunoglobulins.

His mother is breastfeeding and has started to produce milk. The patient has been feeding well every two hours and is urinating over eight times per day. The patient was born at 35 weeks gestation to a 27-year-old gravida 4. The patient is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and the patient\u2019s parents denied all prenatal genetic testing. The pregnancy was uncomplicated until the patient\u2019s mother had spontaneous rupture of membranes at 35 weeks gestation. The patient\u2019s three older siblings are all healthy. In the hospital nursery, the patient\u2019s temperature is 98.2\u00b0F (36.8\u00b0C), blood pressure is 48/32 mmHg, pulse is 164/min, and respirations are 48/min. On physical exam, he appears to be in moderate distress. He has no dysmorphic features, and his abdomen is distended and non-tender. Bowel sounds are absent.\n\nWhich of the following is the best next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Abdominal CT\nB. Abdominal radiograph\nC. Contrast enema\nD. Upper gastrointestinal series\nE. Sweat testing\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Abdominal radiograph.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension, and absent bowel sounds, suggest a possible intestinal obstruction. An abdominal radiograph is a non-invasive and quick test that can help identify signs of bowel obstruction, such as dilated loops of bowel or air-fluid levels. It is a good initial test to evaluate the patient's symptoms and guide further management.\n\nAn abdominal CT (Option A) may be too invasive and not necessary at this point, especially in a newborn. A contrast enema (Option C) may be useful in diagnosing specific conditions such as Hirschsprung's disease, but it is not the best initial test. An upper gastrointestinal series (Option D) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms.

She has no complaints during this visit but her daughter states that she is having difficulty locating objects such as the television remote, car keys, and her purse. Her medical history is significant for Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis and centrilobular emphysema. The patient takes memantine, atorvastatin, metformin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, aspirin, albuterol, and ipratropium. The patient\u2019s vitals are within normal limits today. Physical exam reveals an elderly female in no acute distress, oriented to person, place and year, but not to month or day of the week. She has a 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border along with an S3 gallop. There are mild crackles at the lung bases. The remainder of the exam is normal. A previous urine culture reports growth of > 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter. Urinalysis findings are offered below:\nLeukocyte esterase  positive\nWBCs 50-100 cell/HPF\nNitrites positive\nRBCs 2 cell/HPF\nEpithelial cells 2 cell/HPF\nUrine pH 5.7\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step?\nOptions:\nA. TMP-SMX\nB. Nitrofurantoin\nC. Levofloxacin\nD. Cephalexin\nE. No treatment is necessary\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Nitrofurantoin.\n\nThe patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) as evidenced by the positive leukocyte esterase, presence of WBCs, and positive nitrites on urinalysis. The urine culture previously grew > 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter, which is a common cause of UTIs.\n\nNitrofurantoin is a suitable choice for treating UTIs, especially in elderly patients, because it is less likely to cause Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea and has a lower risk of promoting antibiotic resistance. Additionally, nitrofurantoin is effective against Enterobacter.\n\nTMP-SMX (A) is not a good choice because it can exacerbate the patient's underlying dementia due to its anticholinergic effects. Levofloxacin (C) is a fluoroquinolone that can increase the risk of tendon rupture and C. difficile-associated diarrhea. Cephalexin (D) is a cephalosporin that may not be effective against Enterobacter. No treatment (E) is not necessary because the patient has a symptomatic UTI that requires antibiotic treatment.",

The patient was on 2 antihypertensive medications and a statin, but she was not receiving any antiplatelet drugs. She has a blood pressure of 136/94, heart rate of 84/min, and respiratory rate of 15/min. Initial examination shows global aphasia, right homonymous hemianopia, and hemisensory loss. An acute ischemic stroke caused by distal left internal carotid artery occlusion with salvageable penumbral tissue is diagnosed based on a non-contrast CT scan, brain MRI, and catheter cerebral angiogram. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is given as treatment within 3 hours of presentation. Which of the following cellular processes is typical of the section of reversible injury noted in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Mitochondrial permeability\nB. Caspase activation\nC. Lysosomal rupture\nD. Severe membrane damage\nE. Decreased ATP\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Decreased ATP.\n\nThe patient has an acute ischemic stroke, and the section of reversible injury is referred to as the \"penumbra\". The penumbra is an area of brain tissue that is ischemic but not yet infarcted, and it is characterized by a decrease in ATP production due to reduced blood flow. This decrease in ATP leads to a failure of ion pumps, causing an influx of calcium and sodium ions, and an efflux of potassium ions, which can lead to cellular injury. However, this process is reversible with timely reperfusion, which is why the patient was treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Mitochondrial permeability is a feature of cellular necrosis, not reversible injury.\n\nB. Caspase activation is a hallmark of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, which is not reversible.\n\nC. Lysosomal rupture is a feature of cellular necrosis, not reversible injury.\n\nD. Severe membrane damage is a feature of cellular necrosis, not reversible injury.",

He is found with a blood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, a heart rate of 84/min, an elevated respiratory rate, and a holosystolic heart murmur III/VI. His palms and soles show non-tender erythematous lesions. His personal medical history is relevant for frequent visits to the ER for lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the last month with a recent colonoscopy that reported an ulcerative lesion suggestive of colorectal cancer. He has not been subjected to dental procedures recently, and he denies the use of psychoactive drugs. A chest plain film shows clear lungs and mild cardiomegaly, and echocardiography reports the presence of vegetations involving the mitral valve. Which of the following organisms is the most likely causative agent?\nOptions:\nA. Kingella kingae\nB. Staphylococcus aureus\nC. Escherichia coli\nD. Haemophilus aphrophilus\nE. Streptococcus bovis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Streptococcus bovis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including fever, chills, night sweats, and a holosystolic heart murmur, are consistent with infective endocarditis. The presence of non-tender erythematous lesions on the palms and soles, known as Janeway lesions, is also a characteristic feature of infective endocarditis.\n\nThe patient's recent history of gastrointestinal bleeding and colonoscopy findings suggestive of colorectal cancer are important clues. Streptococcus bovis is a bacterium that is commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract and is associated with colorectal cancer. It is also a known cause of infective endocarditis, particularly in patients with underlying gastrointestinal malignancies.\n\nWhile the other options are also possible causes of infective endocarditis, the patient's history and physical examination findings make Streptococcus bovis the most likely causative agent.",

Upon further questioning, it is found that although his sleeping hours are adequate, he does not feel refreshed in the morning. His wife complains that he snores loudly all night. After ruling out common medical disorders and possible drug abuse, he is advised an overnight polysomnogram that records 12 episodes of apnea and 30 episodes of hypopnea during a 7-hour sleep. Which of the following statements best describes this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. This patient's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is more than 5.\nB. Episodes of apnea and hypopnea are more likely to occur during deeper stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep.\nC. Mouth opening during sleep breaks the seal between the tongue and the teeth and relieves airway obstruction.\nD. The most common site of a collapse of pharyngeal airway during sleep apnea is at the level of the base of the tongue.\nE.

The most common site of a collapse of pharyngeal airway during sleep apnea is at the level of the base of the tongue.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Option A is correct, but it's not the best description of the patient's condition. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is a measure of the severity of sleep apnea, and an AHI of 12 (apnea) + 30 (hypopnea) = 42, which is significantly higher than 5.\n* Option B is incorrect. Apnea and hypopnea episodes are more likely to occur during lighter stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep, not deeper stages.\n* Option C is incorrect. Mouth opening during sleep does not relieve airway obstruction in sleep apnea.\n* Option D is correct. The most common site of pharyngeal airway collapse during sleep apnea is at the level of the base of the tongue, which can lead to obstruction of the airway.\n* Option E is incorrect.

He was born at 38 weeks' gestation to a 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, after an uncomplicated labor and delivery. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother did not receive prenatal care. She takes codeine syrup frequently for dry cough. The infant's temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100\u00b0F), pulse is 165/min, and blood pressure is 83/50 mm Hg. Examination shows hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. The baby is swaddled to prevent excoriations, and fluid resuscitation is initiated. Complete blood count and serum levels of glucose, bilirubin, and calcium are within normal limits. What is the most appropriate next step in treatment of this newborn?\nOptions:\nA. Oral morphine therapy\nB. Oral clonidine therapy\nC. Intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin combination therapy\nD. Oral methimazole therapy\nE. Dextrose infusion\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Oral clonidine therapy.\n\nThe symptoms described in the question, such as high-pitched cry, diaphoresis, hyperreflexia, tremors, and excessive startle response, are consistent with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS occurs in newborns exposed to opioids in utero, and the mother's frequent use of codeine syrup for a dry cough suggests that the infant was exposed to opioids during pregnancy.\n\nClonidine is a medication that is sometimes used to treat NAS, as it can help reduce the severity of withdrawal symptoms. The other options are not directly related to the treatment of NAS:\n\nA. Oral morphine therapy would not be used to treat NAS, as it would further expose the infant to opioids.\n\nC. Intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin combination therapy is an antibiotic regimen, which is not relevant to the treatment of NAS.\n\nD. Oral methimazole therapy is used to treat hyperthyroidism, which is not mentioned in the question.\n\nE. Dextrose infusion may be used to treat hypoglycemia, but it is not specifically related to the treatment of NAS.",

Urine porphyrin levels.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including the presence of blisters on the hands, hyperpigmentation, and increased hair growth on the malar cheeks, are consistent with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). PCT is a type of porphyria that is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, which leads to the accumulation of porphyrins in the skin and urine.\n\nThe laboratory results, including the presence of an anti-nuclear antibody titer of 1:320, suggest that the patient may have an underlying autoimmune disorder, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. However, this does not confirm the diagnosis of PCT.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Anti-dsDNA titers are typically elevated in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, but they do not confirm the diagnosis of PCT.\n\nB. C-reactive protein is a nonspecific marker of inflammation and is not specific to PCT.\n\nC. Anti-hemidesmosome titers are not typically associated with PCT.\n\nE. Tzanck smear is a diagnostic test for herpes simplex virus infection, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.\n\nUrine porphyrin levels would confirm the diagnosis of PCT by demonstrating elevated levels of uroporphyrins and heptacarboxyporphyrins in the urine.",

His wife divorced him about 6 months ago and took the kids and moved out of state. Since then he has had difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time. He takes some comfort in food and has gained about 9.1 kg (20 lb). He eats out several times a week and sometimes consumes 2 whole meals in one sitting. Other than this new obsession with eating large quantities of food and excess sleeping he no longer enjoys doing things he liked doing in the past. Besides eating and sleeping he is always excited to see his children and looks forward to their visits. He says it's the one thing keeping him going. Additionally, he does not feel like he has the same drive or focuses at work. He reports that he has no interest in hurting himself or others.

She says that she has been generally healthy but has noticed difficulty concentrating, becoming increasingly fatigued, and a 15-pound weight increase over the course of a few months. She also reports mild constipation and joint pain. Approximately 6-months ago, she experienced palpitations, increased stool frequency, and a hand tremor. Her past medical history is significant for asthma. Her father is not living and had Parkinson disease, and her mother has poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. She is currently sexually active in a monogamous relationship and uses contraception consistently. She denies cigarette smoking and occasionally drinks wine. She experimented once with lysergic acid diethylamide 6 years ago. Her temperature is 99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 127/98 mmHg, pulse is 55/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, the patient has slow speech and movement. She has tenderness to palpation of her wrist and ankle joints. She has delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following will most likely be found in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Elevated TSH\nB. High Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score\nC. Improved symptoms with carbidopa/levodopa administration\nD. Positive anti-CCP antibodies\nE. Positive urine toxicology\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Elevated TSH.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including difficulty concentrating, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, joint pain, and slow speech and movement, are consistent with hypothyroidism. The physical exam findings of delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes also support this diagnosis. Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. The patient's history of palpitations, increased stool frequency, and hand tremor 6 months prior to the visit may indicate a period of hyperthyroidism, which can precede hypothyroidism in some cases. An elevated TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level would confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism.",

He says that symptoms had an acute onset while he was in the ICU for a COPD exacerbation due to a recent upper respiratory infection, which was treated with nebulized albuterol and ipratropium bromide, continuous oxygen, IV methylprednisolone, and levofloxacin. He says he has been hospitalized 3 other times this year for COPD exacerbations. The medical history is significant for a left main coronary artery myocardial infarction after a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 2 months ago, mild cognitive impairment, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications are metformin, aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, atorvastatin, galantamine, and enalapril. He reports a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. His temperature is 39.0\u00b0C (102.5\u00b0F); blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg; pulse is 122/min; respiratory rate is 20/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. The physical examination is significant for the cutaneous finding shown in the picture. The involved area is severely tender to palpation and there are warmth and crepitus. A foul-smelling discharge is also noted. Pain seems out of proportion to the exam findings. Which of the following is the next best step in management?\nOptions:\nA. High-dose IV dexamethasone\nB.

Immediate debridement of the affected area is necessary to remove dead tissue and reduce the bacterial load. Empiric IV antibiotics should also be started to cover for the likely causative organisms, which may include Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and anaerobes.\n\nOption A, high-dose IV dexamethasone, is not indicated for the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis. Option D, biopsy of the wound, may be useful for diagnostic purposes, but it is not the next best step in management. Option E, contrast CT of the chest and abdomen, may be useful for evaluating the extent of the infection, but it is not as urgent as immediate debridement and antibiotic therapy.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 32-year-old male presents to the ED with acute-onset chest pain. His blood pressure is 157/90 mmHg and his his pulse is 116/min. He appears anxious and agitated and a careful exam reveals dilated pupils and a perforated nasal septum. An EKG reveals ST segment elevation so he is urgently taken for cardiac intervention. Upon review, this patient reveals that he has not had care from a physician since he graduated from college. In the interim he has been largely unemployed and admits that he has recently been homeless. When asked directly, the patient admits to alcohol and marijuana use but denies illicit drug use. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the agent most likely responsible for this patient's presentation?\nOptions:\nA. Blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine\nB. Inhibiting breakdown of biogenic amines\nC. Antagonizing the NMDA receptor\nD. Activating the acetylcholine receptor\nE. Inhibiting the GABA receptor\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including chest pain, hypertension, tachycardia, dilated pupils, and perforated nasal septum, are consistent with cocaine use. Cocaine is a sympathomimetic drug that blocks the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, leading to an increase in their concentrations in the synaptic cleft. This can cause vasoconstriction, tachycardia, and hypertension, which can lead to myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular complications. The patient's history of homelessness and unemployment, as well as his admission of substance abuse, further support the likelihood of cocaine use.",

She wakes up frequently during the night and gets up earlier than desired. She experiences discomfort in her legs when lying down at night and feels the urge to move her legs. The discomfort resolves when she gets up and walks around or moves her legs. She has tried an over-the-counter sleep aid that contains diphenhydramine, which worsened her symptoms. She exercises regularly and eats a well-balanced diet. She admits that she has been under a lot of stress lately. Her brother has similar symptoms. The patient appears anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and iron studies are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Amitryptiline\nB. Pramipexole\nC. Codeine\nD. Propranolol\nE. Escitalopram\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Pramipexole.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with restless leg syndrome (RLS), a neurological disorder characterized by an uncontrollable urge to move one's legs, usually due to uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations. The symptoms worsen at night and are relieved by movement.\n\nPramipexole is a dopamine agonist that is FDA-approved for the treatment of RLS. It is effective in reducing the symptoms of RLS and improving sleep quality.\n\nAmitriptyline (A) is a tricyclic antidepressant that can exacerbate RLS symptoms. Codeine (C) is an opioid that is not typically used to treat RLS. Propranolol (D) is a beta blocker that is not indicated for RLS. Escitalopram (E) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is used to treat depression and anxiety, but it is not typically used to treat RLS.",

Animals exposed to the noninfectious isolate do not develop symptoms of infection. The investigator cultivates the noninfectious isolate in a culture with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate. Some of the animals exposed to these bacteria develop symptoms of infection. Which of the following processes is most likely responsible for the described findings?\nOptions:\nA. Conjugation\nB. Reassortment\nC. Transformation\nD. Generalized transduction\nE. Recombination\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Transformation.\n\nThe scenario described suggests that the noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B acquired genetic material from the infectious isolate, which allowed it to become infectious. This is consistent with the process of transformation, where free DNA from one bacterium is taken up by another bacterium, allowing for the transfer of genetic traits.\n\nConjugation (A) involves the direct transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another through a physical connection. Reassortment (B) is a process that occurs in viruses, not bacteria. Generalized transduction (D) involves the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another through a bacteriophage (virus that infects bacteria). Recombination (E) is a broader term that encompasses several processes, including transformation, but is not the most specific answer in this case.",

His parents are recent immigrants to the United States. He was born in a traditional home birth and has never seen a medical provider. Mom had no prenatal care, has no medical issues, and is unvaccinated. The baby had been breastfeeding well until 24 hours ago when mom noticed he started having trouble latching. In the last 12 hours, he has completely refused to feed. He has had a decreased number of wet diapers and has stooled twice in the last 24 hours. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37.0\u00b0C), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 52/min, and blood pressure is 70/50 mmHg. On exam, the infant has increased tone, a clenched jaw, no head lag, and clenched hands. Initial screening bloodwork is normal. What is the most likely organism causing this infant's presentation?\nOptions:\nA. Clostridium botulinum\nB. Clostridium tetani\nC. Escherichia coli\nD. Group B streptococcus\nE. Listeria monocytogenes\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Clostridium tetani.\n\nThe symptoms described, such as increased tone, clenched jaw, and clenched hands, are consistent with tetanus neonatorum, a rare but serious condition caused by Clostridium tetani infection. The lack of prenatal care and vaccination in the mother, as well as the home birth, increase the risk of tetanus infection in the infant. The normal initial screening bloodwork also supports this diagnosis, as tetanus is not typically associated with abnormal laboratory results.",

The patient was helping his son move this past weekend, and he noticed after the move that he had pain and weakness in his right shoulder. The patient thought that this pain was just him being in poor shape so he started going to the gym and lifting weights which made his symptoms significantly worse. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, obesity, and asthma. His current medications include albuterol, lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide. On physical exam you note an obese gentleman who seems to be in pain. You note prominent weakness of external rotation of his right upper extremity. When you ask the patient to slowly lower his right arm to his side when he holds it overhead, you note that he suddenly drops his arm and appears to be in pain. The patient's strength is 1/5 for abduction of the right arm. Which of the following is most likely injured in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Supraspinatus\nB. Infraspinatus\nC. Teres minor\nD.

The supraspinatus muscle is responsible for abduction of the arm, and weakness in this movement is a key finding in this patient. The sudden dropping of the arm when lowering it from an overhead position, known as a \"drop arm\" sign, is also a characteristic finding in supraspinatus tendon injuries. Additionally, the patient's history of lifting weights, which made his symptoms worse, is also consistent with a supraspinatus tendon injury.",

Within the first 24 hours after birth, the newborn develops fever and a yellow discoloration of skin and sclerae. Examination shows loss of flexion in the extremities, splenomegaly, and cyanosis. Laboratory studies show decreased haptoglobin levels and increased LDH levels. A photomicrograph of a peripheral blood smear is shown. Which of the following is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?\nOptions:\nA. Decrease in the reduced form of glutathione\nB. Maternal antibodies against the rhesus D antigen\nC. Point mutation in \u03b2-globin\nD. Deficiency of ATP\nE. Osmotically fragile erythrocytes\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Osmotically fragile erythrocytes.\n\nThe symptoms described, such as fever, jaundice, and cyanosis, are consistent with hemolytic disease of the newborn. The photomicrograph of the peripheral blood smear likely shows red blood cells with abnormal shapes, such as spherocytes, which are characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis.\n\nHereditary spherocytosis is a genetic disorder that affects the red blood cell membrane, making it osmotically fragile and prone to hemolysis. This leads to anemia, jaundice, and other symptoms seen in this patient.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of this patient's condition:\n\nA. Decrease in the reduced form of glutathione is related to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, a different hemolytic disorder.\n\nB. Maternal antibodies against the rhesus D antigen would be involved in hemolytic disease of the newborn due to Rh incompatibility, but the patient's mother is Rh+, making this unlikely.\n\nC. Point mutation in \u03b2-globin is related to sickle cell disease, a different hemoglobinopathy.\n\nD. Deficiency of ATP is not directly related to hemolytic disease or hereditary spherocytosis.",

She is accompanied by her sister who says that her symptoms developed acutely and is unsure about what caused it. She is currently on methimazole, which she last took approximately 1 week ago. Approximately 5 days ago she developed an upper respiratory infection managed with bed rest and ibuprofen. Her temperature is 105\u00b0F (40.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 95/68 mmHg, pulse is 145/min, and respirations are 23/min. On physical examination, the patient has altered mentation and is agitated and diaphoretic. The patient also has a goiter, exophthalmos, warm skin, and a hand tremor. She is started on intravenous fluids. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Antibiotics\nB. Carotid massage\nC. Clonazepam\nD. Epinephrine\nE. Propranolol\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Propranolol.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as confusion, anxiety, sweating, vomiting, and tachycardia, are consistent with thyroid storm, a life-threatening condition that occurs in patients with untreated or undertreated hyperthyroidism. The patient's history of taking methimazole, a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism, and the presence of a goiter and exophthalmos, which are signs of Graves' disease, support this diagnosis.\n\nPropranolol, a beta-blocker, is a key component of the treatment of thyroid storm. It helps to control the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia, tremors, and anxiety, and can also help to reduce the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3).\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\nA. Antibiotics are not indicated for thyroid storm.\n\nB. Carotid massage is not a treatment for thyroid storm.\n\nC. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that may be used to treat anxiety, but it is not a specific treatment for thyroid storm.\n\nD. Epinephrine is not indicated for thyroid storm and may actually worsen the condition.",

The symptoms usually resolve in 2 to 3 days. She has had these swelling events her whole life; however, they have become more debilitating recently. Last week she had an event that restricted her ability to eat and swallow.  Past medical history is noncontributory. Her father is alive and well with no significant medical history. Her mother and her maternal aunt have a similar condition. Today, her physical exam is within normal limits. She brought a picture of her swollen hand as seen in the picture. The treating physician has a strong suspicion of an inherited disorder. C1-inhibitor levels are ordered and found to be extremely low. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?\nOptions:\nA. DiGeorge syndrome\nB. Chediak-Higashi syndrome\nC. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome\nD. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria\nE. Hereditary angioedema\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Hereditary angioedema.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including recurrent episodes of swelling in the face, hands, and neck, as well as abdominal pain, are consistent with hereditary angioedema (HAE). The fact that the symptoms resolve on their own in 2-3 days and have been present since childhood also supports this diagnosis. The family history of similar symptoms in the patient's mother and maternal aunt suggests an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which is consistent with HAE.\n\nThe low C1-inhibitor levels also support this diagnosis, as HAE is caused by a deficiency of C1-inhibitor, a protein that regulates the complement system.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:\n\nA. DiGeorge syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by abnormalities of the thymus and parathyroid glands, and is not associated with recurrent swelling episodes.\n\nB. Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired phagocytosis and recurrent infections, and is not associated with angioedema.\n\nC. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections, and is not associated with angioedema.\n\nD. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a rare blood disorder characterized by hemolytic anemia and is not associated with angioedema.",

His mother said that when he tried to get out of bed that he was unable to stand without support. He also complained of prickling in his hands and feet. Three weeks ago, he had a fever, dry cough, and a sore throat. The fever and sore throat subsided a week after they began, but the cough is persisting. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medication. His vital signs are within normal limits. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is severe weakness in both lower extremities and mild sensory loss of the hands and feet. Knee and ankle jerk reflexes are absent. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities.

He explains that he has this fear that something terrible will happen to his house if he does not check every appliance, outlet, window and door lock, faucet, and light fixture before he leaves. He states that he must check everything 7 times in a specific order and if he goes out of order he must start from the beginning and perform it all over. He has recently been fired from his job because he is always late and lost his fiancee as she could not deal with his habits anymore. The physician explained that cognitive-behavioral therapy may be of assistance and also prescribed clomipramine. Which of the following is the mechanism of reaction of clomipramine?\nOptions:\nA. Decreases the degradation of norepinephrine and serotonin\nB. Increases the release of norepinephrine and serotonin by alpha 2 receptor antagonism\nC. Blocks only norepinephrine reuptake\nD. Blocks reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin\nE. Increases presynaptic release of norepinephrine and dopamine from vesicles\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Blocks reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.\n\nClomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that works by blocking the reuptake of both norepinephrine and serotonin, increasing their levels in the synaptic cleft. This mechanism of action is thought to contribute to its therapeutic effects in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as well as depression and anxiety disorders.",

Low-dose, increased ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as truncal weight gain, facial hair growth, and thinning skin, are consistent with Cushing's syndrome, which is caused by excess cortisol production. The physician suspects a pituitary adenoma, which would lead to an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production, stimulating the adrenal glands to produce excess cortisol.\n\nThe dexamethasone suppression test is used to diagnose Cushing's syndrome and determine its cause. In this test, a low dose of dexamethasone is administered, and then the ACTH levels are measured. If the patient has a pituitary adenoma, the low dose of dexamethasone will not suppress ACTH production, and ACTH levels will remain elevated.\n\nA high dose of dexamethasone is then administered, and ACTH levels are measured again. If the patient has a pituitary adenoma, the high dose of dexamethasone will suppress ACTH production, and ACTH levels will decrease.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.

The stiffness is worse at the end of the day. She recently retired after working for 28 years as a typist at a data entry firm. Physical examination shows swelling, joint-line tenderness, and decreased range of motion of the first metacarpophalangeal joint and the distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand. Discrete, hard, mildly tender nodules are palpated over the 2nd and 4th distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand.

Degenerative disease of the joints.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including progressive pain and stiffness of the fingers, swelling, joint-line tenderness, and decreased range of motion, are consistent with osteoarthritis (OA). The presence of discrete, hard, mildly tender nodules over the distal interphalangeal joints, known as Heberden's nodes, is a characteristic feature of OA. The x-ray findings of narrowing of the interphalangeal joint spaces with subchondral sclerosis and osteophytes also support the diagnosis of OA.\n\nOA is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage and bone in joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and limited mobility. It is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide, especially in the hands, knees, hips, and spine.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:\n\nA. Monosodium urate crystal precipitation in the joints is characteristic of gout, which typically presents with sudden, severe joint pain and swelling, often in the big toe.\n\nB. Bacterial infection of the joint space is not supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, and would likely present with more acute symptoms such as fever, redness, and swelling.\n\nC. Autoimmune-mediated cartilage erosion is characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which typically presents with symmetric joint involvement, morning stiffness, and systemic symptoms such as fatigue and weight loss.\n\nD.

Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 125/80 mm Hg; heart rate, 87/min; respiratory rate, 14/min; and temperature, 36.7\u2103 (98\u2109). The physical examination is unremarkable and the gynecologic examination is consistent with 18 weeks gestation.

Recommend additional anti-TPO test.\n\nThe patient's thyroid profile shows a low TSH (0.3 mU/L) and elevated total T4 (160 nmol/L) and free T4 (13 pmol/L) levels, which are consistent with hyperthyroidism. However, the patient is pregnant, and the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy can be challenging.\n\nIn this scenario, it is essential to determine the cause of the hyperthyroidism. One possible cause is Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that can cause hyperthyroidism. To confirm this diagnosis, an anti-TPO (thyroid peroxidase) antibody test should be ordered. If the anti-TPO test is positive, it would suggest Graves' disease, and the patient would require further management, including referral to an endocrinologist and possible treatment with antithyroid medications.\n\nOption A is incorrect because levothyroxine is used to treat hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism. Option B is incorrect because the patient's thyroid profile indicates hyperthyroidism, which requires further evaluation and management. Option D is incorrect because methimazole is an antithyroid medication used to treat hyperthyroidism, but it should not be started without a confirmed diagnosis of Graves' disease. Option E is incorrect because assessing T3 levels is not necessary at this point, and the focus should be on determining the cause of the hyperthyroidism.",

His mother reports multiple instances over the past month when she walked into his room while he was masturbating. She is worried he may be going through some sort of \u201cproblem.\u201d He is currently in 9th grade; his mother says that he is the captain of his high school wrestling team and does reasonably well in school. On examination, he seems embarrassed and avoids making eye contact. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Advise the patient to stop masturbating\nB. Measure serum testosterone level\nC. Refer the patient for behavioral therapy\nD. Reassure the mother\nE. Prescribe sertraline\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Reassure the mother.\n\nMasturbation is a normal and healthy part of adolescent development, and it is not uncommon for teenagers to engage in this behavior. The boy's behavior is not indicative of any underlying psychological or medical problem. The mother's concern is likely due to a lack of understanding or discomfort with her son's normal sexual development.\n\nReassuring the mother that her son's behavior is normal and not a cause for concern is the most appropriate next step. This can help to alleviate her anxiety and avoid any unnecessary interventions or stigmatization of the boy's behavior.",

The patient states that he recently retired from working the day shift at a cemetery. When the patient retired, his goal was to finally be able to go out with his wife; however, he finds that he is unable to stay awake past 6 pm in the evening. His inability to stay awake has been straining his marriage as his wife is disappointed that they cannot do any activities in the evening together. The patient has tried drinking caffeine but finds that it does not help. The patient\u2019s wife claims that the patient seems to sleep peacefully, and the patient states he feels rested when he awakes. The patient has a past medical history of irritable bowel syndrome which is managed with fiber supplements. The patient\u2019s neurological exam is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Obstructive sleep apnea\nB. Delayed sleep phase disorder\nC. Advanced sleep phase disorder\nD. Chronic insomnia\nE. Normal aging\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Advanced sleep phase disorder.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as feeling rested in the morning and being unable to stay awake past 6 pm, suggest that his sleep-wake cycle is shifted earlier than usual. This is consistent with advanced sleep phase disorder, a condition in which the body's natural sleep-wake cycle is advanced, causing people to feel tired earlier in the evening and wake up earlier in the morning.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms:\n\nA. Obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep, which is not mentioned in the patient's symptoms.\n\nB. Delayed sleep phase disorder is a condition in which the body's natural sleep-wake cycle is delayed, causing people to feel tired later in the evening and wake up later in the morning. This is the opposite of the patient's symptoms.\n\nD. Chronic insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, which is not consistent with the patient's report of sleeping peacefully and feeling rested in the morning.\n\nE. Normal aging is not a specific sleep disorder, and while it's true that sleep patterns can change with age, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with advanced sleep phase disorder.",

His parents thought that he might just be tired so they put him to bed; however, by the next morning he started to vomit and act extremely irritable. On presentation, he is found to have nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelles. Based on this presentation, appropriate cultures are obtained and he is placed on empiric antibiotics.

Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive bacterium that is known to cause meningitis in newborns, and it is characterized by its tumbling motility in broth at 22\u00b0C.",

She reports that for the past 3 years, she has experienced several periods of depressed mood. The episodes do not coincide with any specific life events and seem to resolve after 4-6 weeks. During these episodes, she experiences a depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and a poor appetite, but she at times is able to enjoy spending time with her children and husband but other times she is distressed and cannot enjoy time with them. Upon further questioning, she also reports experiencing occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years. During these episodes, she is very productive at her work as a lawyer and requires less sleep than usual. Her past medical history is notable for obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. She is on insulin and takes methotrexate. She smokes marijuana occasionally.

Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 119/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities.

Increased lung compliance.\n\nAs people age, their lungs undergo changes that affect respiratory function. One of these changes is an increase in lung compliance, which means that the lungs become more distensible and easier to inflate. This is due to the loss of elastic fibers and the accumulation of senile emphysema, which reduces the lung's ability to recoil and increases its compliance.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nB. Vital capacity, which is the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled from the lungs, decreases with age due to the loss of lung tissue and the reduction in diaphragmatic strength.\n\nC. Residual volume, which is the amount of air left in the lungs after exhalation, increases with age due to the loss of lung tissue and the reduction in diaphragmatic strength.\n\nD. Chest wall compliance does not change significantly with age.\n\nE.

Paramedics arrive quickly, and he is taken to the hospital where several stable lumbar fractures and a shattered right calcaneus are found. He undergoes surgery and his calcaneus is repaired with 11 screws. Which of the following statements best describes the long term post-surgery outcome in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. He will not be able to plantar flex his foot.\nB. He will not be able to point his toe.\nC. He will have a foot drop.\nD. He will have pain with inversion and eversion of his foot.\nE. He will have pain while dorsiflexing his foot.\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. He will have pain while dorsiflexing his foot.\n\nThe calcaneus (heel bone) plays a crucial role in weight-bearing and ankle movement. When it is shattered, as in this case, surgical repair often involves the use of screws to stabilize the bone. However, even with successful surgery, the patient may experience long-term complications.\n\nIn this scenario, the patient is likely to experience pain while dorsiflexing the foot (lifting the foot upwards) due to the altered anatomy and potential arthritis that can develop in the subtalar joint (the joint between the calcaneus and the talus bone). This is because the calcaneus is involved in the movement of the ankle and subtalar joint, and the surgical repair may not fully restore its normal function.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the calcaneus or its repair:\n\nA. Plantar flexion (pointing the foot downwards) is primarily controlled by the Achilles tendon and gastrocnemius muscle, not the calcaneus.\n\nB. Pointing the toe (extending the toes) is controlled by the muscles in the anterior compartment of the lower leg, not the calcaneus.\n\nC. Foot drop (inability to lift the foot) is typically caused by damage to the common peroneal nerve or the muscles that control ankle dorsiflexion, not the calcaneus.\n\nD. Inversion (turning the foot inward) and eversion (turning the foot outward) are movements controlled by the muscles of the lower leg, not the calcaneus. While the patient may experience some stiffness or limited range of motion, pain with inversion and eversion is not a direct consequence of the calcaneus repair.",

His mother had a myocardial infarction at 54 years. His BMI is 23 kg/m2. There is tenderness above the left posterior calcaneus and a firm, 3-cm, skin-colored nodule that moves with the left Achilles tendon. A photomicrograph from a biopsy of the nodule is shown. Serum studies in this patient are most likely to show increased levels of which of the following?\nOptions:\nA. Uric acid\nB. Rheumatoid factor\nC. Angiotensin converting enzyme\nD. Low-density lipoprotein\nE. Triglycerides\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Low-density lipoprotein.\n\nThe photomicrograph from the biopsy of the nodule is likely to show a lipid-rich tumor, consistent with a Achilles tendon xanthoma. This is a benign tumor that occurs in individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic disorder characterized by very high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The patient's family history of a myocardial infarction at a relatively young age (54 years) also supports this diagnosis.",

His mother says that these symptoms developed approximately 2 years ago. The patient was exclusively breastfed up to the age of 7 months. Supplementary feeding was started with non-starchy vegetable followed by starchy vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, and bread. Bread and cookies were the last product to be introduced at the age of 12 months. The patient\u2019s mother tried to withdraw dairy products from the patient\u2019s diet because she heard that lactose can cause such symptoms, but it did not help. The patient\u2019s vital signs include: blood pressure 90/55 mm Hg, heart rate 101/min, respiratory rate 19/min, and temperature 36.3\u2103 (97.3\u2109). His weight is 11 kg (24.2 lb, -2 SD) and height is 90 cm (2 ft 11 in, -1 SD). On physical examination, the patient\u2019s skin is pale with a papulovesicular rash on his abdomen and back. There are a few aphthous ulcers in the oral cavity. The abdomen is distended but no tenderness to palpation. No hepatosplenomegaly. An immunological assay is performed and shows positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies. Which of the following changes would you most likely expect to see on intestinal biopsy in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Granulomas in the submucous tissue\nB. Crypt abscesses\nC. Villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy\nD. Mucosal eosinophilia\nE. Villous hyperplasia\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as episodic diarrhea, malodorous stools, stunted growth, and abdominal cramps, are consistent with celiac disease. The presence of a papulovesicular rash and aphthous ulcers also support this diagnosis. The positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies further confirm the diagnosis.\n\nOn intestinal biopsy, celiac disease is characterized by villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy, which is a flattening of the villi and an increase in the size of the crypts. This is due to the immune-mediated damage to the small intestine caused by the ingestion of gluten.",

She describes the pain as affecting the inside part of the knee as well as the front of her knee, below the kneecap. She denies any inciting injury or trauma to the knee but reports that the pain is worse when she is climbing up stairs or rising from a chair. Physical examination is significant for localized tenderness to palpation over the left anteromedial proximal tibia, 6 cm inferior to the joint line. There is no joint effusion noted. Valgus stress testing is negative for any pain or instability of the knee joint. Radiographs of the left knee are obtained and reveal only mild arthritis, without evidence of any fractures or bony lesions.

Pes anserine bursitis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including pain on the inside part of the knee and below the kneecap, worsened by climbing stairs or rising from a chair, are consistent with pes anserine bursitis. The physical examination finding of localized tenderness to palpation over the anteromedial proximal tibia, 6 cm inferior to the joint line, also supports this diagnosis. Pes anserine bursitis is a common condition that occurs when the bursa (a fluid-filled sac) located on the medial aspect of the proximal tibia becomes inflamed, often due to repetitive friction or overuse.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\nA. Stress fracture of proximal tibia: While the patient's symptoms could be consistent with a stress fracture, the radiographs did not reveal any evidence of a fracture.\n\nB. Medial meniscus tear: The patient's symptoms do not suggest a meniscal tear, and the valgus stress testing was negative for any pain or instability of the knee joint.\n\nC. Medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain: The patient's symptoms do not suggest an MCL sprain, and the valgus stress testing was negative.\n\nE.

She and her boyfriend had intercourse for the first time a few weeks ago. Two weeks ago she missed her menstrual period. She took several over the counter pregnancy tests that confirmed her pregnancy. She is tearful about the pregnancy and is very concerned. After extensive conversations with her physician and counseling, she decides she wants to medically abort her 6-week pregnancy. Which of the following drugs should be administered to this patient for this purpose?\nOptions:\nA. Megestrol\nB. Tamoxifen\nC. Terbutaline\nD. Mifepristone\nE. Copper intrauterine device\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Mifepristone.\n\nMifepristone, also known as RU-486, is a medication that is commonly used for medical abortion, particularly in the early stages of pregnancy (up to 7 weeks). It works by blocking the action of progesterone, a hormone necessary for pregnancy to continue. This leads to the termination of the pregnancy.\n\nThe other options are not correct:\n\nA. Megestrol is a progestin medication, which would actually support pregnancy, not terminate it.\n\nB. Tamoxifen is a medication used to treat breast cancer, not for abortion.\n\nC. Terbutaline is a medication used to treat asthma and other respiratory conditions, not for abortion.\n\nE. Copper intrauterine device (IUD) is a form of contraception, not a medication for abortion.",

Her symptoms occur only when looking sideways. She has myopia and has been wearing corrective lenses for 10 years. Ten days ago, she lost her balance and fell off her bike, for which she went to a hospital. A CT scan of the head at that time showed no abnormalities and she was released without further treatment. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Her best corrected visual acuity is 20/40 in each eye. She has an adduction deficit in the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left; she has an adduction deficit in the left eye and nystagmus in the right eye when looking right. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral disc hyperemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?\nOptions:\nA. Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus\nB. Compressive tumor of the pons\nC. Oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency\nD. Subdural hematoma extending into the orbit\nE. Infarction of the brainstem\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Subdural hematoma extending into the orbit.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including periodic painful double vision, adduction deficits, and nystagmus, suggest a lesion affecting the cranial nerves responsible for eye movement, particularly the third and sixth cranial nerves. The bilateral disc hyperemia on fundoscopy suggests increased intracranial pressure.\n\nGiven the patient's history of a recent head injury from a bike fall, a subdural hematoma extending into the orbit is a likely cause of her symptoms. The CT scan 10 days ago may have missed the hematoma, which can develop slowly over time. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a compressive lesion affecting the cranial nerves, which is supported by the presence of bilateral disc hyperemia.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\nA. Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus would not typically cause painful double vision or bilateral disc hyperemia.\n\nB. A compressive tumor of the pons would likely cause more widespread neurological symptoms and signs.\n\nC. Oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency (Wernicke's encephalopathy) would typically cause more global neurological symptoms, including confusion, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia.\n\nE. Infarction of the brainstem would likely cause more severe and widespread neurological symptoms, including weakness, numbness, and difficulty with speech and swallowing.",

The patient underwent menarche at age 11, and her periods were irregular every 2-3 months for two years. After that, her cycles became roughly regular every 28-35 days, but she has had extremely painful cramps and often has to miss school. The cramps are intermittent and feel like a dull ache in the center of her abdomen, and there is usually accompanying back pain. The patient has been using heating pads with limited relief. She reports some periods being \u201creally heavy\u201d and requires a superabsorbent pad every 6 hours for 2 days each cycle, but this does not limit her activities. She denies any bowel or bladder changes. The patient had normal development throughout childhood, is on the soccer team at school, and is not sexually active. Her father has hypertension and her mother has endometriosis and heavy periods. On exam, the patient is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 158 pounds (BMI 26.3 kg/m^2). She is well appearing and has no abdominal tenderness. She has Tanner IV breasts and Tanner IV pubic hair, and external genitalia are normal. Which of the following is the best next step for this patient\u2019s menstrual cramps?\nOptions:\nA. Von Willebrand factor antigen assay\nB. Pelvic ultrasound\nC. MRI of the pelvis\nD. NSAIDs\nE. Increased exercise\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. NSAIDs.\n\nThe patient's symptoms are consistent with primary dysmenorrhea, which is menstrual cramping without any underlying pelvic pathology. The patient's history of regular cycles, normal physical exam, and lack of bowel or bladder changes make it unlikely that there is an underlying anatomical abnormality. The patient's family history of endometriosis and heavy periods in her mother may be relevant, but it is not the primary cause of her symptoms at this time.\n\nNSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are the first-line treatment for primary dysmenorrhea. They work by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are hormone-like substances that cause uterine contractions and cramping. NSAIDs have been shown to be effective in reducing menstrual cramping and are a safe and well-tolerated treatment option.\n\nThe other options are not the best next step for this patient's menstrual cramps:\n\nA. Von Willebrand factor antigen assay is not relevant to the patient's symptoms and would not be a useful test at this time.\n\nB.

After collecting data on changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up, he is curious if the changes in the aforementioned measurements are statistically significant. Which of the following is the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants\nPulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants\nPlacebo: 395 participants\nTable 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value\nPlaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 \u00b1 2.8 1.2 \u00b1 4.7 15.8 \u00b1 2.9 < 0.01\nLDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 \u00b1 3.6 -11.2 \u00b1 14.3 -8.4 \u00b1 3.9 0.28\nFEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 \u00b1 2.21 0.34 \u00b1 5.54 -0.22 \u00b1 3.21 0.27\nACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 \u00b1 1.22 0.46 \u00b1 3.25 0.12 \u00b1 1.33 0.43\nConclusion:\nPulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.\nSource of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health\"\nOptions:\nA. Pearson correlation analysis\nB. Chi-square test\nC. Analysis of variance\nD. Meta-analysis\nE. Kaplan-Meier analysis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Analysis of variance.\n\nThe cardiologist wants to compare the changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores between the three groups (pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, and placebo) to determine if the changes are statistically significant. Since there are three groups and the outcome variables are continuous, the most appropriate statistical method to use is Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). ANOVA is a statistical technique used to compare means between three or more groups to determine if there are significant differences between them.",

The pain is bilateral, \u201cband-like,\u201d and extends to the neck. The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.5\u2103 (97.7\u2109). The physical examination reveals S2 accentuation that is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border. Palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless. The neurologic exam shows no focal symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism underlying the patient\u2019s headaches?\nOptions:\nA. Meningeal irritation by blood products originating from a chronic subdural hematoma\nB. Dissection of an intracerebral vessel\nC. Pressure created by the content of the paranasal sinuses\nD. Meningeal irritation by a growing intracranial neoplasm\nE. Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Meningeal irritation by blood products originating from a chronic subdural hematoma.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as a bilateral, band-like headache that worsens with coughing or laughing, are consistent with a chronic subdural hematoma. The patient's recent diagnosis of stable angina pectoris and the use of aspirin, which can increase the risk of bleeding, support this diagnosis. The S2 accentuation on physical examination, which is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border, may indicate cardiac decompensation, which can also contribute to the development of a chronic subdural hematoma. The patient's recent upper respiratory tract infection and the lack of meningeal symptoms or focal neurologic deficits make other options less likely.",

On presentation, he is conscious but does not know where he is nor how he got there. His wife is contacted and says that he has been getting increasingly confused over the past 6 weeks. This progressed from misplacing objects to getting lost in places that he knew how to navigate previously. Most worryingly, he has recently started forgetting the names of their children. In addition to these memory changes, she says that he now has rapid jerky movements of his extremities as well as coordination and balance problems. Finally, he has become extremely paranoid about government surveillance and has had hallucinations about secret agents in their house. His previous medical history is significant for a previous car crash in which the patient required internal fixation of a femur fracture and a corneal transplant for corneal degeneration. Otherwise he had no neurologic deficits prior to 6 weeks ago. Physical exam reveals myoclonus and ataxia. Which of the following is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\nOptions:\nA. Can be transmitted on medical equipment even after autoclaving instruments\nB. Contains genetic material but is unable to survive independent from a host\nC. Has a cell wall containing peptidoglycan\nD. Associated with longstanding hypertension\nE. Leads to intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Can be transmitted on medical equipment even after autoclaving instruments.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including rapid cognitive decline, myoclonus, ataxia, and hallucinations, are consistent with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a prion disease. Prions are infectious proteins that can cause disease in humans and animals. They are known to be highly resistant to sterilization and can survive on medical equipment even after autoclaving, which is a process that uses high-pressure steam to sterilize instruments. This is why option A is the correct answer.\n\nOption B is incorrect because prions do not contain genetic material. They are infectious proteins that can cause disease, but they do not have a genome.\n\nOption C is incorrect because prions do not have a cell wall containing peptidoglycan. Peptidoglycan is a component of bacterial cell walls, not prions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because CJD is not associated with longstanding hypertension.\n\nOption E is incorrect because CJD is associated with intracellular aggregations of misfolded prion protein, not hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Tau protein is associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.",

She says she is worried because she and her husband have been trying to conceive for more than a year with no success. Conception by in vitro fertilization was attempted once 3 months ago but was unsuccessful. Analysis of her husband's semen has shown normal sperm counts and morphology. She has a 6-year-old daughter who was born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. She has no history of severe illness and tries to stay healthy by going to the gym an hour per day. Her menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 to 6 days; her last menstrual period started 2 days ago. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's inability to conceive?\nOptions:\nA. Pelvic inflammatory disease\nB. Asherman's syndrome\nC. Diminished ovarian reserve\nD. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism\nE. Premature ovarian failure\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Asherman's syndrome.\n\nThe patient's history of a previous successful pregnancy and regular menstrual cycles make it less likely that she has a hormonal or ovarian problem (options C, D, and E). The fact that her husband's semen analysis is normal also suggests that the issue is with the woman. The patient's symptoms of sleeping problems and inability to concentrate may be related to stress or anxiety, but they are not directly related to the cause of her infertility.\n\nAsherman's syndrome is a condition in which the uterus and/or fallopian tubes are scarred, often as a result of a previous uterine surgery or infection. This scarring can prevent implantation of a fertilized egg and lead to infertility. The fact that the patient had a previous successful pregnancy and has regular menstrual cycles suggests that her ovaries are functioning normally, but the scarring in her uterus may be preventing implantation. This is supported by the fact that in vitro fertilization was unsuccessful, as the embryo may not have been able to implant in the scarred uterus.",

Administer a blood transfusion to save the patient's life.\n\nIn this scenario, the patient's life is in imminent danger, and a blood transfusion is necessary to save his life. While the patient's religious beliefs and written instructions are important, they do not take precedence over the need to preserve life. As a healthcare provider, the primary duty is to act in the best interest of the patient, which in this case means administering a blood transfusion.\n\nIt's worth noting that the patient's wife's wishes, while important, do not have legal authority to make medical decisions on behalf of the patient.

Increase the frequency of blood glucose checks.\n\nWhen a patient with type 1 diabetes develops an illness, such as an upper respiratory infection, it can affect their blood glucose levels. The infection can cause the body to release stress hormones, which can raise blood glucose levels.

Reassurance and follow-up\nC. X-ray of the lower extremities\nD. Bracing of the lower extremities\nE. Tibial osteotomy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Reassurance and follow-up.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination are consistent with physiologic genu varum, a common and normal variation in toddlers. The knees not staying together when the feet and ankles are placed together is a classic sign of genu varum. The fact that the gait is unremarkable and the child is able to kick a ball suggests that the deformity is not causing any functional impairment.\n\nReassurance and follow-up are the most appropriate next steps in management, as physiologic genu varum typically resolves on its own by age 2-3 years. Vitamin D supplementation is not indicated, as there is no evidence of rickets or vitamin D deficiency. X-ray of the lower extremities, bracing, and tibial osteotomy are not necessary at this point, as the deformity is not severe enough to warrant intervention.",

He has had sexual intercourse with multiple men and women over the past year and does not use barrier protection. His last screen for sexually transmitted diseases was 10 years ago and was normal. His past medical history is notable for well-controlled asthma. He was involved in a motorcycle accident 2 years ago and suffered multiple fractured bones in his upper and lower extremities, all of which have healed. He has a distant history of cocaine abuse. He drinks 5-6 glasses of wine per week. His temperature is 100.8\u00b0F (38.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, he appears cachectic but is pleasant and appropriately interactive. An HIV differentiation assay and follow-up Western blot are performed and are positive. The patient is started on tenofovir, abacavir, and efavirenz. However, the patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, so the decision is made to replace this medication with ritonavir. Which of the following adverse effects is this patient at greatest risk for as a result of this change in medication regimen?\nOptions:\nA. Hepatotoxicity\nB. Lipodystrophy\nC. Megaloblastic anemia\nD. Myelosuppression\nE. Peripheral neuropathy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Hepatotoxicity.\n\nRitonavir is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, which can increase the levels of other medications metabolized by this enzyme, including efavirenz. This can increase the risk of hepatotoxicity, particularly in patients with pre-existing liver disease or those taking other hepatotoxic medications. The combination of ritonavir and efavirenz can increase the risk of liver enzyme elevations and hepatitis.\n\nAbacavir, on the other hand, is associated with hypersensitivity reactions, which is why it was discontinued in this patient. Tenofovir is associated with nephrotoxicity, but this is not directly related to the change in medication regimen. Lipodystrophy is a side effect of certain antiretroviral medications, but it is not specifically related to the addition of ritonavir. Megaloblastic anemia is a side effect of zidovudine, which is not part of this patient's regimen. Peripheral neuropathy is a side effect of certain antiretroviral medications, but it is not directly related to the addition of ritonavir.",

His symptoms are progressively getting worse over the past few months despite adequate rest and trial of over the counter analgesics. His back pain is constant and non-radiating in nature. He denies any trauma to his back. His past medical history is insignificant. On examination, there is mild tenderness over the lumbar region in the midline with an absence of paraspinal muscle tenderness. Straight leg raise test is negative. His skin and conjunctiva appear pale. The physician orders basic blood work.

Orthostatic proteinuria\nE. Isolated proteinuria\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Overflow proteinuria.\n\nThe patient's urinalysis shows proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells, which suggests that the proteinuria is not due to glomerular damage or inflammation. The patient's laboratory results also show an elevated calcium level, which is consistent with multiple myeloma. In multiple myeloma, the abnormal proliferation of plasma cells can lead to the production of excessive amounts of immunoglobulins, which can cause proteinuria. This type of proteinuria is known as overflow proteinuria, as the excess immunoglobulins overflow into the urine.\n\nThe other options are not correct because:\n\n* B. Transient (functional) proteinuria is a benign condition that is often seen in healthy individuals, particularly in the upright position. It is not associated with underlying kidney disease or abnormal laboratory results.\n* C. Tubular proteinuria is a type of proteinuria that occurs when the tubules in the kidneys are damaged, leading to the excretion of low-molecular-weight proteins in the urine. It is not consistent with the patient's laboratory results.\n* D. Orthostatic proteinuria is a type of proteinuria that occurs when an individual stands up, and it is often seen in healthy individuals. It is not associated with underlying kidney disease or abnormal laboratory results.\n* E. Isolated proteinuria is a term used to describe proteinuria that occurs in the absence of other signs of kidney disease. It is not a specific type of proteinuria, and it does not fit with the patient's laboratory results.",

The patient refused to explain her behavior to the police. She seemed to be responding to internal stimuli when being initially interviewed. The patient has a past medical history of depression, anxiety, and obesity. The patient has a known history of medication non-compliance. Her temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam the patient is poorly kempt and has an odd body odor. Inspection of her oropharynx reveals multiple ulcers. Cardiac exam is unrevealing with the exception of a friction rub.

IM haloperidol may be used to treat agitation or psychosis, but it is not the next best step in management.\n\nB. Haloperidol depot is a long-acting antipsychotic medication that is not indicated in this scenario.\n\nC. Clozapine is an antipsychotic medication that is not typically used in the acute management of PCP intoxication.\n\nE. ANA and anti-dsDNA levels are not relevant to the patient's presentation and are not the next best step in management.",

On physical examination, the distal interphalangeal joints are swollen, warm, and painful; her nails are pitted and cracked. There are also rough, erythematous skin patches seen over her elbows which have been present for the last few months. She reports that herer father has a similar condition.

Psoriatic arthritis\nD. Enteropathic arthropathies\nE. Dermatomyositis\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Psoriatic arthritis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with psoriatic arthritis, which is a type of inflammatory arthritis that occurs in people with psoriasis. The key features that support this diagnosis include:\n\n* Swelling and redness of the fingers, which is consistent with inflammation of the distal interphalangeal joints\n* Pitted and cracked nails, which is a common feature of psoriasis\n* Rough, erythematous skin patches over the elbows, which is consistent with psoriasis\n* Family history of a similar condition, which suggests a genetic component\n* Moderate benefit from hydrating creams and topical glucocorticoids, which is consistent with the treatment of psoriasis\n\nGout (A) is unlikely because it typically affects the big toe and causes sudden, severe pain, whereas the patient's symptoms are more chronic and affect multiple joints. Reactive arthritis (B) is also unlikely because it typically occurs after a gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection, and the patient's symptoms do not suggest a recent infection. Enteropathic arthropathies (D) are a type of arthritis that occurs in people with inflammatory bowel disease, but the patient's symptoms do not suggest gastrointestinal involvement. Dermatomyositis (E) is a muscle disease that causes skin rash and muscle weakness, but it does not typically cause joint inflammation or psoriasis-like skin lesions.",

Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation.\n\nHere's the explanation:\n\nOvarian cancer typically metastasizes to the brain through the lymphatic system. The most likely route for ovarian cancer to metastasize to the brain is:\n\n1. Sentinel node (in the pelvis): The cancer cells drain into the sentinel lymph node in the pelvis.\n2. Right lumbar trunk: The cancer cells then drain into the right lumbar trunk, which is a lymphatic vessel that carries lymph from the pelvis and lower abdomen.\n3. Cisterna chyli: The right lumbar trunk drains into the cisterna chyli, a lymphatic vessel that collects lymph from the lower body.\n4. Thoracic duct: The cisterna chyli drains into the thoracic duct, the largest lymphatic vessel in the body, which carries lymph from the lower body to the thoracic region.\n5. Left subclavian vein: The thoracic duct drains into the left subclavian vein, which is a major blood vessel that carries blood from the thoracic region to the heart.\n6. Systemic circulation: From the left subclavian vein, the cancer cells enter the systemic circulation and can travel to the brain, where they can metastasize.\n\nOption E correctly describes this lymphatic route.",

TNF-\u03b1 causes vasodilation, increased permeability, and activation of other immune cells, leading to the characteristic symptoms of septic shock, including hypotension, tachycardia, and organ dysfunction.\n\nThe other options are not directly involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock:\n\n* Interleukin-5 (B) is involved in the regulation of eosinophil function and is not typically associated with septic shock.\n* Interleukin-12 (C) is involved in the regulation of cell-mediated immunity and is not a key player in septic shock.\n* Interferon-\u03b1 (D) is involved in the regulation of antiviral responses and is not typically associated with septic shock.\n* Interleukin-4 (E) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can counteract the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, but it is not directly involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock.",

He feels solid food getting stuck in his chest behind the sternum when he eats. Drinking does not cause any difficulty swallowing. He has no coughing or nasal regurgitation. He has no hoarseness or weight loss. He has had heartburn for 2 years with no response to high-dose omeprazole. His past medical history is also significant for asthma and eczema. He takes no medications except for omeprazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormal findings. Which of the following best explains these findings?\nOptions:\nA. Achalasia\nB. Diffuse esophageal spasm\nC. Eosinophilic esophagitis\nD. Esophageal reflux disease\nE. Schatzki\u2019s ring\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Eosinophilic esophagitis.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing solid food, but not liquids, and the feeling of food getting stuck in the chest behind the sternum, are consistent with eosinophilic esophagitis. The lack of response to high-dose omeprazole and the presence of asthma and eczema, which are both atopic diseases, also support this diagnosis. Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus, which can cause dysphagia and food impaction.\n\nAchalasia (A) is a motility disorder that typically presents with difficulty swallowing both solids and liquids, and is often accompanied by regurgitation and weight loss.\n\nDiffuse esophageal spasm (B) is a motility disorder that typically presents with chest pain and dysphagia, but not with the specific symptoms described in this case.\n\nEsophageal reflux disease (D) is unlikely given the patient's lack of response to high-dose omeprazole and the absence of other symptoms such as heartburn or regurgitation.\n\nSchatzki's ring (E) is a rare condition that causes dysphagia, but it is typically associated with a ring-like narrowing of the esophagus, which is not described in this case.",

He was at work as a construction worker when his coworkers found him down at the work site. The patient recently underwent anesthesia for an appendectomy several months ago. He also has a past medical history of schizophrenia well controlled with haloperidol and is currently taking phenytoin for epilepsy. He is also currently taking propranolol for anxiety and hyperthyroidism. His temperature is 106\u00b0F (41.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 109/62 mmHg, pulse is 170/min, respirations are 23/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an altered man with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 10. He has minimal muscle tone and is incoherent when answering questions. The patient is covered in sweat and dirt. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Exertional heat stroke\nB. Malignant hyperthermia\nC. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome\nD. Status epilepticus\nE. Thyroid storm\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Exertional heat stroke.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including altered mental status, high fever (106\u00b0F), tachycardia, and sweating, are consistent with heat stroke. The fact that he was working outdoors as a construction worker and was found down at the work site suggests that he was likely exposed to high temperatures and physical exertion, which can cause heat stroke. The patient's past medical history and medications do not seem to be directly related to the current symptoms.\n\nMalignant hyperthermia (B) is a rare condition that occurs as a reaction to certain anesthetics, but it is unlikely in this case since the patient's appendectomy was several months ago.\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (C) is a rare but life-threatening side effect of antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol, which the patient is taking. However, it typically presents with muscle rigidity, not minimal muscle tone.\n\nStatus epilepticus (D) is a prolonged seizure, but the patient's symptoms do not suggest seizure activity.\n\nThyroid storm (E) is a life-threatening condition that occurs in patients with untreated or undertreated hyperthyroidism, but the patient is already taking propranolol for hyperthyroidism, and his symptoms do not suggest thyroid storm.",

He complains of early satiety, abdominal discomfort after food intake, and abdominal bloating. These symptoms have been present since the patient was 52, but they were milder at that time so he paid little attention to them since. Tingling and decreased sensation in both lower extremities began a few months ago. His relatives also note that he has become excessively somnolent and forgetful. The patient\u2019s medical history is significant for acute hepatitis B 20 years ago. He smokes a pack of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol occasionally. His weight is 61 kg (134.5 lb), height is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in), and BMI is 18.6 kg/m2. His vital signs include: blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate 89/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.1\u00b0C (96.9\u00b0F). The patient\u2019s skin is pale, thin, dry, and hypoelastic. Lymph nodes and the thyroid gland are not enlarged. Lung and heart examinations are within normal limits for his age. The patient\u2019s tongue is bright red with atrophic papillae. The abdomen is distended and tender to palpation in the epigastric area. Neurological examination shows symmetrical bilateral distal hypoesthesia for all sensations and decreased muscle strength in both upper and lower extremities. On a mini-mental status examination, the patient scores 25.

Chronic bilirubin toxicity\nB. Chronic hyperglycemia\nC. Chronic acetaldehyde influence\nD. Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids\nE. Influence of pseudo-neurotransmitters\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including tingling and decreased sensation in both lower extremities, somnolence, and forgetfulness, suggest a neurological disorder. The patient's laboratory results show a macrocytic anemia, which is a common feature of vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient's neurological symptoms are consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause demyelination of nerve fibers due to impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the patient's bilirubin levels are not elevated, and chronic bilirubin toxicity is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the patient's glucose levels are normal, and chronic hyperglycemia is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the patient's history of occasional alcohol consumption is not sufficient to cause chronic acetaldehyde influence, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nOption E is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with the influence of pseudo-neurotransmitters, which is a rare condition caused by certain medications or toxins.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A four-day-old neonate is brought to the pediatrician with vaginal discharge for the last two days. Her mother is concerned about the blood-tinged discharge but states that her daughter has been feeding and voiding well. The neonate was delivered at 39 weeks gestation by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, and she and her mother were discharged home after two days. The prenatal course was complicated by chlamydia in the mother during the first trimester, for which she and the partner were both treated with a negative test of cure. The neonate\u2019s biological father is no longer involved the patient's care, but her mother\u2019s boyfriend has been caring for the baby whenever the mother rests. At this visit, the neonate\u2019s temperature is 98.5\u00b0F (36.9\u00b0C), pulse is 138/min, and respirations are 51/min. She appears comfortable, and cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. There are no bruises or marks on her skin. Examination of the genitals reveals no vulvar irritation or skin changes, but there is scant pink mucoid discharge at the introitus. Which of the following is the best next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Vaginal exam under anesthesia\nB. Report to child protective services\nC. Vaginal culture\nD. Warm water irrigation of the vagina\nE. Reassurance\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Reassurance.\n\nThe symptoms described, including the blood-tinged discharge, are consistent with a normal physiologic process in newborn females, known as pseudomenstruation or vaginal bleeding. This occurs due to the withdrawal of maternal hormones after birth and is usually self-limited. The neonate's overall health and examination are normal, and there is no indication of abuse or neglect. Therefore, reassurance and education to the mother about this normal process are the best next step in management.",

He reports a 6-month history of slowly progressive tiredness associated with dull achy pain in his knees, hips, and shoulders. His past medical history is notable for hypertension, diabetes, and stable angina. He takes lisinopril, metformin, glyburide, and aspirin. He has a history of intravenous drug use and was homeless in his early 30\u2019s. He drinks alcohol socially and has a 30 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 18/min.

Sofosbuvir and simeprevir.\n\nThe patient has a positive Hepatitis C IgG and a high HCV RNA level, indicating chronic hepatitis C infection. The treatment of choice for hepatitis C has shifted in recent years to direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), which are more effective and better tolerated than traditional interferon-based regimens.\n\nSofosbuvir is a DAA that targets the HCV NS5B polymerase, and simeprevir is a DAA that targets the HCV NS3/4A protease. The combination of sofosbuvir and simeprevir is a recommended treatment regimen for genotype 1 hepatitis C, which is the most common genotype in the US.\n\nInterferon-alpha (option B) is an older treatment for hepatitis C that is no longer commonly used due to its side effects and lower efficacy compared to DAAs. Interferon-gamma (option C) is not a treatment for hepatitis C. Ribavirin (option D) is a medication that was often used in combination with interferon-alpha, but it is not typically used as a single agent. Lamivudine (option E) is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV infection, not hepatitis C.",

The swelling is associated with sweaty palms and soles, insomnia, irritability, nervousness, and fatigue; however, the patient does not complain of fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, weight loss, vision problems, or body swelling. The patient\u2019s medical history is negative for similar symptoms or a thyroid disorder. The vital signs are within normal limits.

During this time he has felt like his eyes have been unusually puffy in the mornings and his urine has been frothy. He has hypertension and rheumatoid factor-positive rheumatoid arthritis. Current medications include amlodipine, methotrexate, and ibuprofen. He does not smoke. He has a history of chronic alcohol abuse. His temperature is 36.7\u00b0C (98\u00b0F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 148/86 mm Hg. Physical examination shows pallor, periorbital edema, 2+ pedal edema, and ascites.

In this case, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest that the amyloid is depositing in the kidneys, leading to nephrotic syndrome.\n\nOption A is unlikely because ibuprofen is not typically associated with nephrotic syndrome. Option B is also unlikely because there is no evidence of heart failure or decreased cardiac ejection fraction. Option D is possible, but serum amyloid A is more commonly associated with reactive amyloidosis, which is typically seen in conditions such as chronic infections or inflammatory disorders.

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 17-year-old male presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient was an unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. He has a past medical history of asthma, depression, and anxiety. He is not currently taking any medications. His temperature is 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C), blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. The patient is breathing on his own and has strong distal pulses. Ultimately, the patient is discharged with follow up instructions after no significant fractures or injuries are found. The patient then presents 4 months later to his primary doctor with weakness. The patient's strength in his upper extremities is 1/5. He has reduced sensation in his upper extremities as well. The patient's lower extremities reveal 5/5 strength with intact sensation. A chest radiograph and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Cervical spine fracture\nB. Intracranial hemorrhage\nC. Syringomyelia\nD. Brachial plexopathy\nE. Conversion disorder\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Brachial plexopathy.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of weakness and reduced sensation in the upper extremities, with normal strength and sensation in the lower extremities, suggest a peripheral nerve injury. The history of a motor vehicle accident 4 months prior, particularly the fact that the patient was an unrestrained driver in a head-on collision, increases the likelihood of a brachial plexopathy. The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that originates in the neck and shoulder region and controls movement and sensation in the arm. Trauma to this area, such as a stretch or compression injury, can cause damage to the nerves and result in weakness and sensory deficits in the arm.\n\nOption A, cervical spine fracture, is unlikely given the patient's normal cardiopulmonary exam and lack of significant fractures or injuries found on initial presentation. Option B, intracranial hemorrhage, is also unlikely given the patient's normal mental status and lack of neurological deficits on initial presentation. Option C, syringomyelia, is a rare condition that affects the spinal cord and is not typically associated with a history of trauma. Option E, conversion disorder, is a psychological disorder that can cause physical symptoms, but it is unlikely to cause the specific pattern of weakness and sensory deficits seen in this patient.",

Menses occur irregularly at 45 to 65-day intervals. She is 159 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 23 kg/m2. Physical examination shows facial acne and growth of coarse dark hair on the face, chest, and lower back. Pelvic examination shows no abnormalities.

Compression of the infundibular stalk\nD. Ovarian fibrosis and multiple cystic follicles\nE. Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including excess hair growth on her face, irregular menses, and acne, are consistent with androgen excess. The laboratory results show elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, which is a precursor to cortisol and androgens, and testosterone, which is an androgen hormone. This suggests that the patient has a disorder of adrenal androgen production.\n\nThe elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone level is particularly suggestive of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a group of genetic disorders that affect the adrenal glands' ability to produce cortisol and aldosterone. In this case, the patient likely has 21-hydroxylase deficiency, a common form of CAH that leads to excess androgen production.\n\nThe other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:\n\nA. Hyperproliferation of theca interna cells is associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is a different condition characterized by ovarian cysts and insulin resistance.\n\nB. Exogenous anabolic steroid use would not cause the specific laboratory abnormalities seen in this patient.\n\nC. Compression of the infundibular stalk is associated with hyperprolactinemia, which is not seen in this patient.\n\nD. Ovarian fibrosis and multiple cystic follicles are features of PCOS, which is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.",

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?\nOptions:\nA. Propranolol\nB. Dantrolene\nC. Bromocriptine\nD. Cyproheptadine\nE. Surgical embolectomy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Dantrolene.\n\nThe patient is experiencing symptoms of malignant hyperthermia (MH), a rare but life-threatening medical emergency that can occur in response to certain medications, including anesthetics and neuromuscular blockers. The symptoms include muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, tachycardia, and increased end-tidal CO2.\n\nDantrolene is the specific treatment for malignant hyperthermia. It works by inhibiting the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which helps to reduce muscle contraction and heat production.\n\nPropranolol (A) is a beta blocker that may be used to treat hypertension, but it is not effective in treating malignant hyperthermia.\n\nBromocriptine (C) is a dopamine agonist that is used to treat Parkinson's disease and hyperprolactinemia, but it is not related to the treatment of malignant hyperthermia.\n\nCyproheptadine (D) is an antihistamine that is used to treat allergies and itching, but it is not relevant to the treatment of malignant hyperthermia.\n\nSurgical embolectomy (E) is a procedure used to remove blood clots from blood vessels, but it is not related to the treatment of malignant hyperthermia.",

Single-positive CD4+ T cell\nE. Single-positive CD8+ T cell\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Double-positive T cell.\n\nPositive selection occurs during the double-positive stage of T cell development, when the T cell expresses both CD4 and CD8 molecules on its surface. At this stage, the T cell undergoes a process of selection, where it is tested for its ability to recognize and respond to self-MHC molecules. T cells that can recognize self-MHC molecules are preserved, while those that cannot are eliminated. This process ensures that mature T cells are self-MHC-restricted, meaning they can recognize and respond to antigens presented by self-MHC molecules.",

The patient reports that he returned from active duty in Iraq 3 months ago and was adjusting to life back at home until about 7 weeks ago when he began having intense fear of loud noises and seeing sudden flashbacks to bombing attacks he endured during his time in Iraq. He had to take a leave from his army instructor duties as he was not able to handle the familiar settings of practice shooting ranges and sudden loud explosions during battalion training. After refusing to leave his house, he was finally persuaded by his wife to visit your clinic. What is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Acute stress disorder\nB. Performance anxiety\nC. Schizophrenia\nD. Posttraumatic stress disorder\nE. Panic attack\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Posttraumatic stress disorder.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including upsetting dreams, anxiety, disturbing flashbacks, intense fear of loud noises, and avoidance of triggers that remind him of the traumatic event (in this case, the bombing attacks in Iraq), are all consistent with a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The fact that the symptoms began 7 weeks after his return from active duty and have been persistent enough to interfere with his daily life and relationships also supports this diagnosis.\n\nAcute stress disorder (Option A) is a possibility, but it typically occurs within hours or days of the traumatic event, and the symptoms usually resolve within 2-4 weeks. The patient's symptoms have persisted for 7 weeks, making PTSD a more likely diagnosis.\n\nPerformance anxiety (Option B) is not a good fit, as the patient's symptoms are not related to a specific performance or situation, but rather to the traumatic event he experienced.\n\nSchizophrenia (Option C) is not supported by the patient's symptoms, as there is no evidence of hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized thinking.\n\nPanic attack (Option E) is also not a good fit, as the patient's symptoms are not limited to a single episode of intense fear or discomfort, but rather are persistent and related to a specific traumatic event.",

Antibodies against alpha-3 segment of collagen IV (COL4A3)\nC. Mucus\nD. Surfactant\nE. Elastase\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Elastase.\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs and liver. The deficiency of alpha-1 antitrypsin, a protease inhibitor, allows elastase, a proteolytic enzyme, to break down elastin, a protein that provides elasticity to the lungs. This leads to the destruction of lung tissue and the development of emphysema.\n\nNeutrophils and alveolar macrophages release elastase, which is responsible for the lung damage in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Cigarette smoking can exacerbate the condition by increasing the release of elastase from these cells.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency:\n\nA. Major Basic Protein is a protein released by eosinophils, not neutrophils or alveolar macrophages.\n\nB. Antibodies against alpha-3 segment of collagen IV (COL4A3) are associated with Goodpasture's syndrome, a different disease.\n\nC. Mucus is a thick, protective substance produced by the respiratory tract, but it is not directly related to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.\n\nD.

In-patient psychiatric therapy (C) may also be necessary in some cases, but CBT is a more specific and effective treatment for anorexia nervosa. Antidepressants (D) may be used to treat co-occurring depression or anxiety, but they are not a primary treatment for anorexia nervosa. Appetite stimulants (E) are not an appropriate treatment for anorexia nervosa, as they may exacerbate the patient's unhealthy relationship with food.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 27-year-old man with a history of cocaine abuse comes to the physician 2 weeks after undergoing successful arthroscopic repair of a torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee. There were no complications. He was discharged with prescriptions for oxycodone and acetaminophen. He complains of severe pain that prevents him from participating in physical therapy and wakes him from sleep. Physical examination of the left knee shows a healing incision; there is no joint effusion, erythema, or evidence of wound dehiscence, and his gait is normal. When the physician recommends switching to ibuprofen for pain, he becomes visibly angry and demands a refill of oxycodone. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient's request?\nOptions:\nA. Prescribe a long-acting opioid for better pain relief if he is willing to sign a pain contract\nB. Request further information about which drugs he has taken recently and in the past\nC. Request consent for urine test to assess current drug use\nD. Prescribe a short course of oxycodone and schedule a follow-up appointment in one week\nE. Refer to a substance use counselor for addiction counseling\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Request further information about which drugs he has taken recently and in the past.\n\nThe patient's behavior, such as becoming visibly angry and demanding a refill of oxycodone, suggests that he may be experiencing opioid withdrawal or craving. Given his history of cocaine abuse, it is essential to assess his current and past drug use to determine the best course of action. Requesting further information about his drug use will help the physician to identify potential addiction or misuse and make an informed decision about his pain management.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: An 89-year-old woman sees her neurologist for a follow-up evaluation. Three months ago, she presented with complaints about facial asymmetry. Her daughter has noticed that her mother\u2019s mouth is droops downwards on the right side of her face and that she cannot close her right eye well. The same side also lacks wrinkles on the forehead. Since then, the patient feels like her facial muscles have gotten weaker. She was given a course of corticosteroids, but she has still not recovered fully. Upon being asked to close her eyes, the patient has difficulty doing so and fails to completely close her eyelids. On examination, there is no loss of pain, temperature, or crude or tactile touch sensations in the whole face. The neurological exam is otherwise unremarkable. This patient also has type 2 diabetes mellitus which is well controlled with metformin. The neurologist recommends a therapy that will help relieve her symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely treatment option being prescribed to this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Botox\nB. Carbamazepine\nC. Vitamin B12\nD. Methylprednisolone\nE. Ceftriaxone\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Botox.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, including facial asymmetry, drooping of the mouth, inability to close the right eye, and lack of wrinkles on the forehead, are consistent with a diagnosis of Bell's palsy, a condition that affects the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). The patient's failure to fully recover with corticosteroids suggests that additional therapy is needed to relieve her symptoms.\n\nBotox (botulinum toxin) is often used to treat facial asymmetry and weakness associated with Bell's palsy. It can help relax the affected muscles and improve facial symmetry. The other options are not directly related to the treatment of Bell's palsy or facial asymmetry:\n\n* Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant medication used to treat seizures and trigeminal neuralgia.\n* Vitamin B12 is a nutrient that plays a role in nerve function, but it is not typically used to treat Bell's palsy.\n* Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid, which the patient has already received without full recovery.\n* Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, which is not relevant to this patient's condition.",

He has no cough. He was treated for a neck abscess 6 months ago. He takes no medications. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years and drinks two to three beers daily. He has been using intravenous cocaine and heroin for 6 years. He appears ill. His temperature is 38.6\u00b0C (101.5\u00b0F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are retinal hemorrhages with pale centers. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard best at the lower left sternal border. Laboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 13.3 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 14,300/mm3\nPlatelet count 278,000/mm3\nSerum\nGlucose 96 mg/dL\nCreatinine 1.0 mg/dL\nTotal bilirubin 0.4 mg/dL\nAST 18 U/L\nALT 22 U/L\nTransthoracic echocardiography shows multiple vegetations on the tricuspid valve and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Two sets of blood cultures are collected. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\"\nOptions:\nA. Transesophageal echocardiography\nB. Intravenous vancomycin therapy\nC. X-ray of the chest\nD. CT pulmonary angiogram\nE. Intravenous ciprofloxacin therapy\n\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Intravenous vancomycin therapy.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest endocarditis, which is a serious infection of the heart valves. The presence of track marks on both cubital fossae and a history of intravenous drug use increase the likelihood of endocarditis. The transthoracic echocardiography showing multiple vegetations on the tricuspid valve and moderate tricuspid regurgitation further supports this diagnosis.\n\nIntravenous vancomycin therapy is the most appropriate next step in management because it is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against many types of bacteria that can cause endocarditis, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin is often used as empiric therapy for endocarditis until blood culture results are available.\n\nTransesophageal echocardiography (A) may be useful in further evaluating the extent of the endocarditis, but it is not the next step in management. A chest X-ray (C) may be useful in evaluating for pulmonary complications, but it is not as urgent as starting antibiotic therapy. A CT pulmonary angiogram (D) is not necessary at this point, and ciprofloxacin (E) is not a suitable empiric antibiotic for endocarditis.",

A 9-month-old boy who has had recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia in the past three months.\n\nBruton's agammaglobulinemia is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by the absence of immunoglobulins (antibodies) in the blood. It typically presents in males between 6-12 months of age with recurrent bacterial infections, particularly otitis media and pneumonia, due to the inability to produce antibodies against encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n\nOption D is the most consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia because it describes a 9-month-old boy with recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia, which is a classic presentation of the disease.\n\nOption A is more consistent with a diagnosis of ataxia-telangiectasia, which is a different primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by progressive neurologic symptoms, including clumsiness, and recurrent infections.\n\nOption B is more consistent with a diagnosis of DiGeorge syndrome, which is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by hypocalcemia, heart defects, and recurrent viral infections.\n\nOption C is more consistent with a diagnosis of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, which is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by recurrent fungal infections, particularly oral candidiasis.\n\nOption E is more consistent with a diagnosis of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, which is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections.",

His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions. Which of the following is a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition?\nOptions:\nA. Affective symptoms\nB. Slow onset\nC. Being single\nD. Male sex\nE. Negative symptoms\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Affective symptoms.\n\nThe patient's symptoms suggest a psychotic episode, and the presence of affective symptoms (such as grandiosity, agitation, and boastful behavior) is a predictor of good prognosis.

Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, particularly the yellowing of the eyes (scleral icterus), suggest a diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome, a benign condition characterized by mild, intermittent jaundice. The patient's history of a similar episode 4 years ago after an appendectomy and the recent episode after binge drinking are consistent with this diagnosis. Gilbert's syndrome is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, which is involved in the conjugation and excretion of bilirubin. This deficiency leads to increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood, causing jaundice.",

CT scan in the ED revealed a 4-mm stone occluding the right ureter. She was able to pass the stone without assistance over the course of 5 hours. Pathology report on the stone states it was composed of calcium oxalate. She says that the pain of passing the stone was excruciating and asks how she can prevent kidney stones in the future. Which of the following interventions is most likely to prevent renal calculi formation in the future for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Decreasing calcium intake\nB. Decreasing sodium intake\nC. Increasing consumption of nuts and seeds\nD. Loop diuretic pharmacotherapy\nE. Urine acidification with cranberry juice\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Decreasing sodium intake.\n\nCalcium oxalate stones are the most common type of kidney stones, and they are often associated with high sodium intake. Reducing sodium intake can help reduce the amount of calcium in the urine, which can in turn reduce the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation.\n\nDecreasing calcium intake (Option A) is not recommended, as adequate calcium intake is important for bone health, and reducing calcium intake may not necessarily reduce the risk of stone formation.\n\nIncreasing consumption of nuts and seeds (Option C) may not have a significant impact on stone prevention, as these foods are not specifically known to affect calcium oxalate stone formation.\n\nLoop diuretic pharmacotherapy (Option D) is not typically used for stone prevention, and may even increase the risk of stone formation in some cases.\n\nUrine acidification with cranberry juice (Option E) may be helpful for preventing urinary tract infections, but it is not specifically effective for preventing calcium oxalate stone formation.",

She says she is now having trouble walking a full block. For the past week, she also has noticed bilateral swelling of the lower legs. She denies chest pain, fever, chills, syncope, or bloody sputum. Current vitals include: temperature 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse 63/min, blood pressure 128/91 mm Hg and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, there is elevated jugular venous pressure, decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the lung bases, and 1+ non-pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities. A chest X-ray demonstrates a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the diagnosis of this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Bronchoalveolar wash\nB. Pulmonary function studies\nC. Echocardiography\nD. Chest CT\nE. Biopsy of the heart\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Echocardiography.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest heart failure, particularly right-sided heart failure, which is supported by the elevated jugular venous pressure, decreased breath sounds at the lung bases, and bilateral lower extremity edema. The chest X-ray also shows a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette, which further supports this diagnosis. Echocardiography is a non-invasive test that can evaluate cardiac structure and function, and is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing the underlying cause of the patient's heart failure.\n\nBronchoalveolar wash (Option A) is typically used to diagnose infections such as pneumonia, which is not suspected in this patient. Pulmonary function studies (Option B) may be useful in diagnosing lung disease, but are not the most appropriate next step in this patient. Chest CT (Option D) may be useful in evaluating lung disease or other conditions, but is not as specific to cardiac function as echocardiography. Biopsy of the heart (Option E) is an invasive procedure that is typically reserved for specific indications, such as suspected cardiac tumors or amyloidosis, and is not the most appropriate next step in this patient.",

The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. He was breastfed for the first 3 months and then switched to cow\u2019s milk and about two months ago she started giving him fruits and vegetables. Family history is noncontributory. Today, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, and temperature of 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). On examination, he has a heartbeat with a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Generally, the boy looks pale. His weight and height fall within the expected range. A complete blood count (CBC) shows the following:\nHemoglobin (Hb): 9.1 g/dL\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV): 65 fL\nTotal iron binding capacity (TIBC): 550 \u03bcg/dL\nSerum iron: 45 \u00b5g/dL\nSerum lead: < 5 \u00b5g/dL\nWhat is the best treatment for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Iron supplementation only\nB. Proper diet and iron supplementation\nC. Multivitamins\nD. Proper diet only\nE. Lead chelation therapy\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Proper diet and iron supplementation.\n\nThe patient's laboratory results indicate iron deficiency anemia, which is characterized by a low hemoglobin level (9.1 g/dL), low mean corpuscular volume (65 fL), and low serum iron level (45 \u00b5g/dL). The total iron binding capacity (TIBC) is elevated, which is also consistent with iron deficiency.\n\nThe patient's history of being breastfed for only 3 months and then switched to cow's milk, which is low in iron, may have contributed to the development of iron deficiency anemia. The introduction of fruits and vegetables two months ago may not have provided sufficient iron to meet the patient's needs.\n\nThe best treatment for this patient is to provide iron supplementation in addition to a proper diet that is rich in iron. This will help to increase the patient's iron stores and resolve the anemia. Option A, iron supplementation only, is not sufficient as the patient also needs a proper diet to ensure adequate iron intake. Options C, D, and E are not relevant to the patient's diagnosis and are therefore incorrect.",

Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her first child was born at term by vaginal delivery. She has no history of any serious illnesses. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. Current medications include vitamin supplements. Her temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (98.9\u00b0F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg. Speculum examination demonstrates clear fluid at the cervical os. The fetal heart rate is reactive at 160/min with no decelerations. Tocometry shows uterine contractions. Nitrazine testing is positive. She is started on indomethacin. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\nOptions:\nA. Administer ampicillin and perform amnioinfusion\nB. Administer ampicillin and progesterone\nC. Administer ampicillin and test amniotic fluid for fetal lung maturity\nD. Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with cesarean section\nE. Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with induction of labor\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with induction of labor.\n\nThe patient is presenting with symptoms of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), which is confirmed by the presence of clear fluid at the cervical os and a positive nitrazine test. The fetal heart rate is reactive, and there are no signs of fetal distress.\n\nThe patient is already receiving indomethacin, which is a tocolytic medication used to slow down uterine contractions. The next step in management would be to administer betamethasone to promote fetal lung maturity, as the patient is at risk of delivering prematurely. Ampicillin is also indicated to prevent group B streptococcal infection.\n\nInduction of labor is the most appropriate next step, as the patient's membranes are already ruptured, and the risk of infection and other complications increases with time. Cesarean section is not indicated at this point, as the patient is not in distress and the fetus is not in distress. Amnioinfusion is not necessary, and testing amniotic fluid for fetal lung maturity is not relevant in this scenario. Progesterone is not indicated for PPROM.",

He has a history of constipation. His temperature is 39.1\u00b0C (102.4\u00b0C). Abdominal examination shows left lower quadrant tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 19,000/mm3. A CT scan of the abdomen shows segmental wall thickening of the descending colon with multiple diverticula and a 5.0-cm, low-attenuation pelvic lesion with air-fluid levels. CT-guided drainage of the fluid collection yields 250 mL of yellow-greenish fluid. Release of which of the following substances is most likely responsible for the formation of the drained lesion?\nOptions:\nA. Staphylococcal coagulase\nB. Interferon-gamma\nC. Lipoteichoic acid\nD. Interleukin-3\nE. Lysosomal enzymes\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Lysosomal enzymes.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are consistent with diverticulitis, a complication of diverticulosis. The 5.0-cm, low-attenuation pelvic lesion with air-fluid levels is likely an abscess that has formed as a result of the infection. The yellow-greenish fluid drained from the lesion is likely pus, which is a collection of dead white blood cells, bacteria, and cellular debris.\n\nLysosomal enzymes, such as proteases and lipases, are released by neutrophils and macrophages in response to bacterial infection. These enzymes help to break down bacterial cell walls and other foreign substances, but they can also contribute to tissue damage and the formation of abscesses. In this case, the release of lysosomal enzymes is likely responsible for the formation of the abscess that was drained.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the formation of an abscess in the context of diverticulitis:\n\nA. Staphylococcal coagulase is a bacterial enzyme produced by Staphylococcus aureus, which is not typically associated with diverticulitis.\n\nB. Interferon-gamma is a cytokine involved in the immune response to viral and bacterial infections, but it is not directly related to the formation of abscesses.\n\nC. Lipoteichoic acid is a component of the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria, but it is not directly involved in the formation of abscesses.\n\nD. Interleukin-3 is a cytokine involved in the regulation of hematopoiesis, but it is not directly related to the formation of abscesses.",

Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).\nResults:\nThe rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).\nConclusions:\nMepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.\nGiven the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?\nOptions:\nA. A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.\nB. A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.\nC. A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.\nD. A type 1 error is a beta (\u03b2) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.\nE. A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.\n\nA type 1 error, also known as a false positive, occurs when a study finds a statistically significant difference between groups when, in reality, there is no true difference. This means that the null hypothesis (which states that there is no difference between groups) is actually true, but the study results suggest otherwise.\n\nIn the context of this study, if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error, it would mean that mepolizumab does not actually reduce asthma exacerbations or improve markers of asthma control, but the study results suggest that it does.",

She was born with a disease that has led her to have recurrent upper respiratory infections throughout her life requiring antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. She marries a man (without this disease phenotype) from a population where the prevalence of this disease is 1/100. What is the chance that their child will have the disease of interest?\nOptions:\nA. 9/100\nB. 1/10\nC. 18/100\nD. 81/100\nE. 9/10\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. 1/10.\n\nThe woman has a disease that is likely cystic fibrosis, which is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that she is homozygous for the mutated gene (ff).\n\nHer husband is not affected, so he is likely to be a carrier of the mutated gene (Ff). The probability that he is a carrier is related to the prevalence of the disease in his population, which is 1/100. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of the mutated allele (q) can be calculated as:\n\nq = \u221a(1/100) = 0.1\n\nThe probability that her husband is a carrier (Ff) is 2pq, where p is the frequency of the normal allele (1 - q). Therefore:\n\n2pq = 2(0.9)(0.1) = 0.18\n\nSo, the probability that her husband is a carrier is approximately 18%.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability that their child will have the disease. Since the woman is homozygous for the mutated gene (ff), she will contribute an f allele to each child. The husband, being a carrier, has a 50% chance of contributing an f allele to each child. Therefore, the probability that their child will have the disease (ff) is:\n\n1/2 \u00d7 1 = 1/2\n\nSince the husband is not affected, we only need to consider the probability that he contributes an f allele. Therefore, the probability that their child will have the disease is 1/2 or 1/10 (as a decimal).\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. 1/10.",

The photomicrograph from the sputum sample likely shows asbestos bodies, which are a characteristic finding in asbestosis.\n\nAsbestosis is a restrictive lung disease that can cause an increase in the alveolar-arterial gradient, which is a measure of the difference between the oxygen levels in the alveoli and the arterial blood. This is because the disease causes scarring and stiffening of the lungs, making it harder for oxygen to diffuse into the bloodstream.\n\nThe other options are not directly related to the patient's condition:\n\n* B. Bloody pleural effusion is more commonly associated with malignancy or trauma, rather than asbestosis.\n* C. Increased total lung capacity is more characteristic of obstructive lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n* D. Concave flow-volume loop is a finding seen in obstructive lung diseases, such as COPD or asthma.\n* E. Increased diffusing capacity (DLCO) is not a typical finding in asbestosis. In fact, DLCO is often decreased in asbestosis due to the scarring and stiffening of the lungs.",

Her past medical history is significant for varicose veins in her lower extremities, well-controlled diabetes mellitus type 2, and a 25 pack-year smoking history. The patient currently takes metformin and pioglitazone. Family history is significant for her sister who died at the age of 35 because of a pulmonary embolism. Her temperature is 37.8\u00b0C (100.0\u00b0F), the pulse is 111/min, the respirations are 18/min, and the blood pressure is 130/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is pale and diaphoretic. Cardiac exam is significant for an S3 gallop. There is erythema and swelling over multiple varicose veins in her left leg. Ultrasound of her left leg is positive for a deep vein thrombosis. The patient is admitted, and anticoagulation is started with a vitamin K inhibitor. However, despite these interventions, she dies shortly after admission. Which of the following was the most likely etiology of this patient\u2019s condition?\nOptions:\nA. Distal peripheral microembolism\nB. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia\nC. Necrotizing fasciitis\nD. Protein S deficiency\nE. Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Protein S deficiency.\n\nThe patient's history of varicose veins, family history of pulmonary embolism, and development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) suggest a possible underlying thrombophilia. The patient's sudden onset of dyspnea and death despite anticoagulation therapy suggest a massive pulmonary embolism (PE) as the cause of death. Protein S deficiency is a thrombophilia that increases the risk of DVT and PE. The other options are not supported by the patient's history and presentation:\n\nA. Distal peripheral microembolism would not typically cause sudden onset of dyspnea and death.\n\nB. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is unlikely, as the patient was started on a vitamin K inhibitor, not heparin.\n\nC. Necrotizing fasciitis is an infection that would typically cause fever, pain, and skin changes, which are not described in the patient's presentation.\n\nE. Waldenstr\u00f6m macroglobulinemia is a type of cancer that would not typically cause DVT or PE.",

During this period, she also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss and has become increasingly short of breath with mild exertion. She has congestive heart failure and hypertension. Three months ago, she was in India for 3 weeks to attend a family wedding. She worked as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 47 years. Her current medications include enalapril, digoxin, isosorbide, spironolactone, and metoprolol. She appears thin. Her temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a glucose level of 90 mg/dL, serum lactate dehydrogenase of 227 U/L, and serum protein of 6.3 g/dL.

Mesothelioma.\n\nThe patient's history of working as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years suggests exposure to asbestos, which is a strong risk factor for mesothelioma. The presence of nodular pleural lesions on the right side and a moderate-sized pleural effusion on the chest x-ray, along with the characteristics of the pleural fluid aspirate (turbid fluid, high protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels), are consistent with a diagnosis of mesothelioma.\n\nWhile bronchial adenocarcinoma (option A) is a possible cause of pleural effusion, the patient's history and radiographic findings are more consistent with mesothelioma. Nephrotic syndrome (option C) is unlikely given the patient's normal serum protein level. Tuberculosis (option D) is possible, but the patient's recent travel to India and the characteristics of the pleural fluid aspirate make mesothelioma a more likely diagnosis. Congestive heart failure (option E) can cause pleural effusion, but the patient's effusion is more likely related to her occupational exposure to asbestos.",

She recently joined a walking program with her friends in order to lose weight; however, she noticed that she was not able to keep up with her friends during the program. She has a 60-pack-year history of smoking as well as hypertension well-controlled on medication. The following represent the parameters for this patient's respiratory anatomy and function:\n\nVital capacity (VC): 5,000 mL\nInspiratory reserve volume (IRV): 2,500 mL\nFunctional reserve capacity (FRC): 2,700 mL\nResidual volume (RV): 1,000 mL\nUpper airway volume: 100 mL\nConducting airway volume: 125 mL\n\nInspired CO2 pressure (PiCO2): 1 mmHg\nArterial CO2 pressure (PaCO2): 50 mmHg\nExpired CO2 pressure (PeCO2): 20 mmHg\n\nWhich of the following best represents the total volume of gas in this patient's airways and lungs that does not participate in gas exchange?\nOptions:\nA. 225 mL\nB. 480 mL\nC. 600 mL\nD. 800 mL\nE. 1200 mL\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. 225 mL.\n\nThe question is asking for the volume of gas in the airways and lungs that does not participate in gas exchange, which is also known as the \"anatomical dead space\". This includes the upper airway volume (100 mL) and the conducting airway volume (125 mL). Therefore, the total anatomical dead space is:\n\n100 mL + 125 mL = 225 mL\n\nSo, the correct answer is option B. 225 mL.",

Her past medical history is non-contributory and she is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.7\u00b0F (37.6\u00b0C), blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of abdominal tenderness, a left adnexal mass, and left adnexal tenderness.

Laparoscopy.\n\nThe patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, including sudden and severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and a left adnexal mass with tenderness, are consistent with a diagnosis of ovarian torsion. The presence of free fluid surrounding the ovary with edema and Doppler flow on transvaginal ultrasound also supports this diagnosis.\n\nLaparoscopy is the best next step in management because it allows for a minimally invasive surgical exploration of the pelvis to confirm the diagnosis and potentially detorse the ovary. Ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency that requires prompt intervention to prevent ovarian necrosis and infertility.\n\nA CT scan of the abdomen (Option A) may not provide sufficient information to diagnose ovarian torsion and may delay treatment. Laparotomy (Option C) is a more invasive surgical approach that may be necessary if laparoscopy is not possible or if the patient's condition is unstable. MRI of the pelvis (Option D) may not be necessary in this case, as the ultrasound findings are already suggestive of ovarian torsion. Observation and serial abdominal exams (Option E) are not appropriate, as ovarian torsion requires prompt surgical intervention to prevent complications.",

During this time, he has also had shortness of breath and palpitations on exertion. He has noticed blood in his stools on three separate occasions in the past 4 months. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease. He drinks two to four beers daily. He does not smoke. His pulse is 95/min and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Examination shows pale conjunctivae. The abdomen is soft with no organomegaly. Rectal examination is unremarkable. His hemoglobin concentration is 7.2 g/dL, hematocrit is 32%, and mean corpuscular volume is 68 \u03bcm3. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's bleeding?\nOptions:\nA. Dilated submucosal veins in the lower third of the esophagus\nB. Inflammation in an outpouching of the colonic wall\nC. Symptomatic enlargement of hemorrhoidal plexus\nD. Chronic mucosal and submucosal inflammation of the colon\nE. Arteriovenous malformation in the colonic wall\n\nResponse: The correct answer is E. Arteriovenous malformation in the colonic wall.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations on exertion are consistent with anemia, which is confirmed by the low hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit. The presence of blood in the stools suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, and the patient's history of end-stage renal disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the likelihood of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in the colon. AVMs are a common cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with chronic kidney disease and can cause recurrent bleeding episodes.",

She was seated and was being tattooed on her right upper flank when she became diaphoretic, pale, and passed out. According to her boyfriend, the patient slipped to the floor and her arms and legs moved in a jerky fashion for a few seconds. She regained consciousness within half a minute and was alert and fully oriented immediately. She has no history of serious illness. She works as an event manager and has had more stress than usual due to a recent concert tour. She appears well. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.4\u00b0F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 120/72 mm Hg. Her cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows an incomplete right bundle branch block. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nOptions:\nA. Vasovagal syncope\nB. Orthostatic syncope\nC. Tonic-clonic seizure\nD. Cardiac arrhythmia\nE. Cardiac structural abnormality\n\"\n\nResponse: The correct answer is A. Vasovagal syncope.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as becoming diaphoretic, pale, and passing out, are consistent with vasovagal syncope. The fact that she regained consciousness within half a minute and was alert and fully oriented immediately also supports this diagnosis. The jerky movements of her arms and legs for a few seconds are likely a convulsive response to the syncopal episode, which is common in vasovagal syncope.\n\nVasovagal syncope is a common cause of loss of consciousness, especially in young adults, and is often triggered by emotional stress, pain, or other stimuli. The patient's recent stress due to a concert tour and the painful stimulus of getting a tattoo may have contributed to the episode.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\nB. Orthostatic syncope is unlikely because the patient was seated when she passed out.\n\nC. Tonic-clonic seizure is unlikely because the patient's symptoms and the brief duration of the episode are not consistent with a seizure disorder.\n\nD. Cardiac arrhythmia is unlikely because the ECG shows an incomplete right bundle branch block, which is a benign finding, and there is no other evidence of a cardiac arrhythmia.\n\nE. Cardiac structural abnormality is unlikely because the patient's cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities, and there is no other evidence of a cardiac structural abnormality.",

Apply a simple shoulder sling.\n\nThe patient has a fracture of the right clavicle, which is a common injury that can occur from a fall onto the shoulder. The x-ray of the chest shows a displaced fracture of the right clavicle. The patient is in acute distress and has limited range of motion due to pain.\n\nThe most appropriate next step in management is to apply a simple shoulder sling to immobilize the shoulder and provide pain relief. This is a non-surgical treatment that can help the fracture heal on its own.\n\nTension banding (Option A) is not necessary for a clavicle fracture, and a clavicular plate (Option B) is a surgical option that may be considered if the fracture is severely displaced or if there are other complications. An MRI of the right shoulder (Option D) is not necessary at this point, as the x-ray has already confirmed the diagnosis of a clavicle fracture. Arteriography (Option E) is not indicated, as there is no evidence of vascular injury.",

She has been living alone since her husband passed away 2 years ago. She has remained an active member of her retirement community's wine club; however, she stopped attending the meetings 3 weeks ago. She is generally able to her maintain her house, but her house appears more disorganized over the past 2 weeks. She generally drives short distances but avoids driving long distances as she occasionally gets lost when navigating new areas. She feels like her balance is getting worse, but she has not fallen. She has noticed increased urinary urgency over the past 8 months and has had 2 episodes of incontinence. Despite these changes, she reports feeling well. She drinks 4-6 glasses of wine per day. She was started on multiple medications for worsening anxiety by her psychiatrist 1 month ago. Her BMI is 31 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 99.8\u00b0F (37.7\u00b0C), blood pressure is 115/65 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 17/min. On examination, she is oriented to person and time but not place or situation. She does not seem to recognize her doctor despite knowing him for many years. She becomes somnolent intermittently throughout the interview. She can recall 0/3 words after 5 minutes. She has a low-frequency tremor in her right arm that increases in severity with deliberate movement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Alzheimer dementia\nB. Delirium\nC. Lewy body dementia\nD. Normal pressure hydrocephalus\nE. Pseudodementia\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Normal pressure hydrocephalus.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as urinary incontinence, gait disturbance, and cognitive decline, are consistent with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). NPH is a condition in which there is an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, leading to ventricular enlargement, despite normal cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The patient's history of urinary urgency and incontinence, as well as her gait disturbance, are common symptoms of NPH. Additionally, the patient's cognitive decline, including her difficulty with orientation and memory, are also consistent with NPH.\n\nWhile Alzheimer's disease (Option A) is a possibility, the patient's symptoms are not typical of Alzheimer's, and the rapid decline in her cognitive function over a short period of time is more consistent with NPH.\n\nDelirium (Option B) is a possibility, given the patient's somnolence and fluctuating level of consciousness, but the patient's symptoms are not solely due to delirium, and the underlying cause of her symptoms is more likely to be NPH.\n\nLewy body dementia (Option C) is a possibility, given the patient's cognitive decline and tremor, but the patient's symptoms are not typical of Lewy body dementia, and the presence of urinary incontinence and gait disturbance are more consistent with NPH.\n\nPseudodementia (Option E) is not a likely diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms are not solely due to depression or anxiety, and the patient's cognitive decline is not reversible with treatment of her anxiety.",

He reports that he feels well and has no complaints. He takes enalapril and metformin. His temperature is 98.8\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), blood pressure is 155/90 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 16/min. His physician adds another anti-hypertensive medication to the patient\u2019s regimen. One month later, the patient returns to the physician complaining of new onset lower extremity swelling. Which of the following medications was likely prescribed to this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Metoprolol\nB. Verapamil\nC. Nifedipine\nD. Hydrochlorthiazide\nE. Spironolactone\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Verapamil.\n\nThe patient's symptoms of lower extremity swelling are consistent with calcium channel blocker (CCB) induced edema, which is a common side effect of verapamil. Verapamil is a CCB that is often used to treat hypertension, and it can cause peripheral edema due to increased blood flow and permeability in the peripheral vasculature. The other options are less likely to cause edema as a side effect:\n\nA. Metoprolol is a beta blocker that can cause fatigue, dizziness, and bradycardia, but it is not typically associated with edema.\n\nC. Nifedipine is a CCB that can cause edema, but it is more likely to cause ankle edema rather than lower extremity swelling.\n\nD. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that is used to treat hypertension and edema, so it is unlikely to cause edema as a side effect.\n\nE. Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic that can cause hyperkalemia, but it is not typically associated with edema.",

A week ago, she returned from India, where she was working with an NGO to build houses in rural areas. The patient took one dose of chloroquine one week before her trip. She also took a further dose during her trip. She has no history of a serious illness.

Although she feels generally healthy she has noticed gaining about 9 kg (20 lb) over the last year. She eats a healthy, varied diet and exercises at the gym 4 days a week, including 20 minutes of aerobic exercise. On further questioning, she has also noted fatigue and constipation. She denies shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, or blood in her stool. At the clinic, the vital signs include: pulse 52/min, blood pressure 110/72 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. The physical exam is notable only for slightly dry skin. The complete blood count (CBC) is within normal limits. Which of the following laboratory values is most likely elevated in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Erythropoietin\nB. Glucose\nC. Triiodothyronine (T3)\nD. Thyroxine (T4)\nE. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)\n\nResponse: The correct answer is D. Thyroxine (T4).\n\nThe patient's symptoms of weight gain, fatigue, and constipation, along with a normal physical exam and CBC, suggest hypothyroidism. The patient's low pulse rate (52/min) is also consistent with hypothyroidism. In hypothyroidism, the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is typically elevated, but the thyroxine (T4) level is low. Therefore, option D is the most likely elevated laboratory value in this patient.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of persistent diarrhea and fatigue for 1 month. She has had up to 12 watery stools per day. Sometimes she awakens at night because she has to defecate. She has abdominal bloating and cramps. She has had a 2-kg weight loss in the past month. She returned from a trip to Costa Rica 7 weeks ago. She has a history of bronchial asthma and bulimia nervosa. She works as a nurse. She does not smoke and drinks 1\u20132 beers on the weekend. Current medications include fish oil, a multivitamin, and a salbutamol inhaler. Her temperature is 36.8\u00b0C (98.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg.

Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?\"\nOptions:\nA. Celiac disease\nB. Carcinoid tumor\nC. VIPoma\nD. Irritable bowel syndrome\nE. Medication abuse\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. VIPoma.\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as persistent diarrhea, fatigue, abdominal bloating, and cramps, are consistent with a VIPoma (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide-secreting tumor). The laboratory results, including hypokalemia (low potassium levels) and a normal anion gap, also support this diagnosis. The colonoscopy findings of dark-colored mucosa with interspersed white spots are also characteristic of VIPoma.\n\nVIPoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that secretes excessive amounts of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), leading to a syndrome of watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria (lack of stomach acid). The patient's history of bulimia nervosa and her occupation as a nurse may have contributed to her delayed presentation and diagnosis.\n\nThe other options are less likely:\n\nA. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes malabsorption, but it does not typically cause hypokalemia or the characteristic colonoscopy findings seen in this patient.\n\nB. Carcinoid tumor is a type of neuroendocrine tumor, but it typically causes flushing, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, rather than the specific symptoms seen in this patient.\n\nD. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that can cause abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits, but it does not typically cause hypokalemia or the characteristic colonoscopy findings seen in this patient.\n\nE. Medication abuse is unlikely, given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, and there is no evidence to suggest that she is abusing medications.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 21-year-old college student comes to the physician because of daytime fatigue for 2 months. He has problems getting to sleep at night and frequently falls asleep during class. Recently he has started skipping classes altogether. He goes to bed between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. but cannot fall asleep for 2\u20133 hours. When he wakes up at 8:30 a.m., he feels extremely drowsy, and he tries to overcome his fatigue by drinking 2\u20133 cups of coffee a day. He naps at various times during the afternoon, often for more than an hour. He stopped watching videos on his smartphone at night because of suggestions from his peers. He states that he has tried over-the-counter melatonin pills and exercising at 8 p.m. without success. He has no history of serious illness. He does not smoke. He drinks three to five beers on weekends. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Trial of diphenhydramine\nB. Complete caffeine cessation\nC. Stop evening exercise\nD. Alcoholic beverage prior to bedtime\nE. Scheduled afternoon naps\n\nResponse: The correct answer is B. Complete caffeine cessation.\n\nThe patient is experiencing daytime fatigue, difficulty falling asleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness, which are all symptoms of insomnia. The patient's caffeine consumption (2-3 cups of coffee per day) is likely contributing to his insomnia, as caffeine can interfere with sleep quality and duration. Stopping caffeine consumption altogether may help improve the patient's sleep quality and reduce his daytime fatigue.\n\nThe other options are not as appropriate:\n\nA. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that can cause drowsiness, but it is not a recommended treatment for insomnia and can have negative side effects.\n\nC. Exercise in the evening can actually help improve sleep quality, so stopping evening exercise is not likely to be beneficial.\n\nD. Consuming an alcoholic beverage before bedtime can disrupt sleep patterns and reduce sleep quality, so this is not a recommended strategy.\n\nE. While napping can be helpful for some people, the patient's long naps (often over an hour) may be contributing to his insomnia and daytime fatigue. Scheduled afternoon naps may not be the best approach in this case.",

Over the past 3 years, he has been dressing all in black and wears a long black coat, even in the summer. The mother reports that her son has always had difficulties fitting in. He does not have any friends and spends most of his time in his room playing online games. He is anxious at college because he is uncomfortable around other people, and his academic performance is poor. Rather than doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons. He says that he has never seen any demons, but sometimes there are signs of their presence. For example, a breeze in an enclosed room is likely the \u201cbreath of a demon\u201d.

Avoidant personality disorder\nC. Schizotypal personality disorder\nD. Paranoid personality disorder\nE. Schizophrenia\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Schizotypal personality disorder.\n\nThe patient's behavior and symptoms are consistent with schizotypal personality disorder, which is a personality disorder characterized by eccentric behavior, odd speech, and magical thinking. The patient's dressing style, interest in paranormal phenomena, and interpretation of natural events as signs of demonic presence are all indicative of eccentric behavior. His laborious speech and avoidance of eye contact are also consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nWhile social anxiety disorder (A) may be present, it is not the primary diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms go beyond social anxiety. Avoidant personality disorder (B) is also possible, but the patient's eccentric behavior and magical thinking are more consistent with schizotypal personality disorder. Paranoid personality disorder (D) is not supported by the patient's symptoms, as he does not exhibit suspiciousness or mistrust of others.
