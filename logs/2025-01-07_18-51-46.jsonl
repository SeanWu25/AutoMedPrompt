During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?\nOptions:\nA. Disclose the error to the patient but leave it out of the operative report\nB. Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report\nC. Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake\nD. Report the physician to the ethics committee\nE. Refuse to dictate the operative report\n\nResponse: The correct next action for the resident to take would be option C: Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake. It is important for medical professionals to be transparent and honest with their patients, and failing to document a complication in the operative report could be considered a violation of this principle. The resident should bring up their concerns with the attending physician and express their belief that the complication should be documented in the operative report. If the attending physician still insists on leaving the complication out of the report, the resident may need to consider reporting the incident to the ethics committee or seeking guidance from a trusted mentor or supervisor. However, the first step should be to bring up the issue with the attending physician directly.",

Generation of free radicals.\n\nThe symptoms described in the question, specifically the sensorineural hearing loss, are consistent with ototoxicity, which is a known side effect of certain chemotherapy drugs. The drug that the patient received for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder is likely a platinum-based chemotherapy agent, such as cisplatin or carboplatin. These drugs work by generating free radicals that damage DNA, leading to cell death. However, these free radicals can also damage the hair cells in the inner ear, resulting in hearing loss. Therefore, the expected beneficial effect of the drug is due to its ability to generate free radicals and damage DNA in cancer cells.",

The eosinophilia (elevated eosinophils) and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the renal biopsy showing intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles is a characteristic finding in cholesterol embolization.\n\nRenal papillary necrosis (A) is typically associated with sickle cell disease, diabetes, and analgesic abuse, and it would not present with eosinophilia. Allergic interstitial nephritis (B) would present with acute kidney injury, eosinophilia, and rash, but it would not have the characteristic renal biopsy findings of cholesterol embolization.

Nitroglycerin\n\nThe patient's symptoms and history are suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which requires immediate attention. Nitroglycerin is the first-line treatment for ACS, as it helps to reduce the workload on the heart by dilating the coronary arteries and reducing myocardial oxygen demand. It also helps to alleviate the patient's symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.\n\nWhile labetalol and diltiazem are useful in managing hypertension, they are not the first-line treatment for ACS. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can be used to manage hypertension and reduce myocardial oxygen demand, but it should be used with caution in patients with ACS, as it can worsen symptoms by reducing heart rate and cardiac output.

Her vital signs are: blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg, pulse 73/min and respiratory rate 16/min. She is afebrile. Physical examination is within normal limits. Which of the following past medical history statements would make copper IUD placement contraindicated in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. A history of stroke or venous thromboembolism\nB. Current tobacco use\nC. Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)\nD. Past medical history of breast cancer\nE. Known liver neoplasm\n\nResponse: The correct answer is C. Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\n\nCopper IUDs are generally safe and effective, but there are certain contraindications to their use. One such contraindication is active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the reproductive organs that can cause scarring and damage to the fallopian tubes, making it difficult or impossible to place an IUD. Additionally, an IUD can increase the risk of PID, especially in women who have a history of the infection. Therefore, it is important to rule out active or recurrent PID before placing a copper IUD.\n\nOption A, a history of stroke or venous thromboembolism, is not a contraindication to copper IUD placement. While OCPs can increase the risk of these conditions, copper IUDs do not have the same risk.\n\nOption B, current tobacco use, is not an absolute contraindication to copper IUD placement, but it may increase the risk of certain complications, such as expulsion or perforation. Women who smoke should be counseled about these risks and monitored closely.\n\nOption D, past medical history of breast cancer, is not a contraindication to copper IUD placement. In fact, IUDs are often recommended for women who cannot take hormonal contraceptives due to a history of breast cancer.\n\nOption E, known liver neoplasm, is a contraindication to copper IUD placement. Women with liver neoplasms may have abnormal liver function, which can increase the risk of complications with an IUD.",

He currently has no complaints and claims to be \u201cas fit as a fiddle.\u201d The physical examination findings are unremarkable, except for a mid-systolic murmur heard in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids on auscultation. The physician instructs the patient to stand from a supine position with the stethoscope still placed on his chest. Which of the following changes would occur with this maneuver?\nOptions:\nA. An increase in right atrial pressure\nB. An increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure\nC. An increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure\nD. A reduction in the slope of the pacemaker potential\nE. A reduction in diastolic filling time\n\nResponse: E. A reduction in diastolic filling time\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe murmur heard in this scenario is likely to be a physiologic murmur, which is commonly heard in young and healthy individuals. However, in this case, the murmur is heard in a middle-aged individual, which raises suspicion for a pathologic cause such as aortic stenosis.\n\nThe maneuver described in the question is known as the \"diamond-shaped\" or \"pulsus parvus et tardus\" murmur, which is a characteristic finding in aortic stenosis. This maneuver involves standing up from a supine position, which decreases venous return and subsequently reduces diastolic filling time.\n\nIn aortic stenosis, the narrowed aortic valve orifice leads to a pressure gradient between the left ventricle and the aorta during systole. This pressure gradient causes a murmur that is typically heard best in the aortic area and radiates to the carotids. The murmur is usually harsh, crescendo-decrescendo in shape, and systolic in timing.\n\nWhen the patient stands up from a supine position, the reduction in diastolic filling time leads to a decrease in the duration of the murmur, making it shorter and softer. This change in the murmur is known as the \"diamond-shaped\" or \"pulsus parvus et tardus\" murmur and is a characteristic finding in aortic stenosis.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E. A reduction in diastolic filling time.",

After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection. Which of the following viruses is capable of undergoing the above-mentioned process?\nOptions:\nA. Cytomegalovirus\nB. Epstein-Barr virus\nC. Human immunodeficiency virus\nD. Rotavirus\nE. Vaccinia virus\n\nResponse: The process described in the question is known as \"reassortment\" or \"genetic recombination\" and it typically occurs in segmented viruses, where the genome is divided into separate segments. This process allows for the mixing and matching of genome segments between different viruses of the same family, resulting in a novel virus strain.\n\nBased on this information, the correct answer is:\nD. Rotavirus\n\nRotaviruses are double-stranded RNA viruses that have a segmented genome, making them capable of undergoing reassortment.

His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack.

Previous radiation therapy\n\nThe patient's history of breast cancer treated with radiation therapy, along with the presence of centroblastic and immunoblastic cells on fine-needle aspiration, raises suspicion for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL)\u2013diffuse large B cell variant. Previous radiation therapy is a known risk factor for developing NHL, particularly in patients with a history of breast cancer. While travel to Africa, axillary lymph node involvement, female gender, and previous breast cancer may contribute to the patient's current presentation, previous radiation therapy is the primary risk factor responsible for this patient\u2019s condition.",

In addition, she seems to have less energy compared to other babies and appears listless throughout the day. She was born by cesarean section to a G1P1 woman with no prior medical history and had a normal APGAR score at birth. Her parents say that she has never been observed to turn blue. Physical exam reveals a high-pitched holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following abnormalities?\nOptions:\nA. 22q11 deletion\nB. Deletion of genes on chromosome 7\nC. Lithium exposure in utero\nD. Maternal alcohol consumption\nE. Retinoic acid exposure in utero\n\nResponse: The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with option A: 22q11 deletion. This chromosomal abnormality is also known as DiGeorge syndrome or velocardiofacial syndrome, and it is characterized by congenital heart defects, including conotruncal anomalies that can cause high-pitched holosystolic murmurs. The murmur is best heard at the lower left sternal border, which is consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD), a common feature of 22q11 deletion. Additionally, infants with 22q11 deletion may present with feeding difficulties, poor growth, and low energy levels due to cardiac dysfunction and low oxygen saturation. The other options are not associated with the symptoms and physical exam findings described.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 62-year-old patient has been hospitalized for a week due to a stroke. One week into the hospitalization, he develops a fever and purulent cough. His vitals include: heart rate 88/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 38.4\u00b0C (101.1\u00b0F), and blood pressure 110/85 mm Hg. On physical examination, he has basal crackles on the right side of the chest. Chest radiography shows a new consolidation on the same side. Complete blood count is as follows:\nHemoglobin 16 mg/dL\nHematocrit 50%\nLeukocyte count 8,900/mm3\nNeutrophils 72%\nBands 4%\nEosinophils 2%\nBasophils 0%\nLymphocytes 17%\nMonocytes 5%\nPlatelet count 280,000/mm3\nWhat is the most likely causal microorganism?\nOptions:\nA.

Streptococcus pneumoniae. The patient's sudden onset of fever, purulent cough, and new consolidation on chest radiography are consistent with pneumonia. The white blood cell count with a neutrophil predominance and the presence of bands also support this diagnosis. Among the options provided, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in adults. Other factors that support this diagnosis include the patient's age and the presence of basal crackles on physical examination. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are more commonly associated with hospital-acquired pneumonia, while Haemophilus influenzae is a less common cause of pneumonia in adults and Mycobacterium tuberculosis typically presents with a more insidious onset and chronic symptoms.",

    "text": "System:Respond to the multiple choice question.\nQuery: Question: A 6-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother for worsening wheezing and shortness of breath over the past day. He has not had a fever, cough, vomiting, or diarrhea. He has asthma and eczema. He uses a glucocorticoid inhaler and an albuterol inhaler but has missed his medications for the past week while on vacation. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 100/80. Expiratory and inspiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. There are moderate intercostal and subcostal retractions and a decreased inspiratory to expiratory ratio. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium treatments and intravenous methylprednisolone are given in the emergency department for a presumed asthma exacerbation. One hour later, the child is limp and lethargic. Magnesium sulfate is administered. His temperature is 36\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse is 150/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/70. No wheezing is heard on repeat pulmonary examination.

Perform bronchoscopy\nD. Provide helium and oxygen mixture\nE. Provide additional dose of methylprednisolone\n\nResponse: The most appropriate next step in management would be option A: intubate with mechanical ventilation. The child's respiratory status has significantly worsened despite treatment for an asthma exacerbation, as evidenced by his decreased level of consciousness, bradycardia, and decreased respiratory rate. These symptoms are concerning for impending respiratory failure and the child may require intubation and mechanical ventilation to support his respiratory function. Options B, C, and D are not indicated at this time. Option E may be considered if there is a concern for inadequate steroid dosing, but the child's clinical status suggests that more urgent intervention is needed.",

Which of the following is most likely dysfunctional in this patient?\nOptions:\nA. Lymphocytes\nB. Immunoglobulin class switching\nC. Superoxide dismutase\nD. Myeloperoxidase\nE. Respiratory burst\n\nResponse: E. Respiratory burst\n\nThe nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test is used to measure the respiratory burst in neutrophils, which is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to a stimulus. Failure of neutrophils to react during the NBT test suggests a dysfunction in the respiratory burst. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an enzyme that plays a role in the respiratory burst, but a dysfunction in MPO alone would not explain the recurrent infections by multiple species. A dysfunction in lymphocytes or immunoglobulin class switching would not explain the recurrent bacterial and fungal infections. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an antioxidant enzyme that protects cells from the damaging effects of ROS, so a dysfunction in SOD would not explain the failure of neutrophils to produce ROS.",

Steeple sign\n\nThe symptoms described in the question are consistent with croup, a viral infection that causes inflammation of the upper airway, leading to the characteristic \"seal-bark\" cough and stridor. A chest X-ray in a child with croup is likely to show a steeple sign, which is a narrowing of the trachea at the level of the subglottis, creating a steeple-like appearance. This finding is indicative of the narrowing of the airway that occurs in croup. The other options listed are not typically associated with croup.",
