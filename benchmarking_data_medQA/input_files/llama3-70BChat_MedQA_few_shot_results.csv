"A microbiologist is studying the emergence of a virulent strain of the virus. After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection. Which of the following viruses is capable of undergoing the above-mentioned process?",D,"The correct answer is D. Rotavirus.

The process described in the question is called reassortment, which is a mechanism of genetic recombination that occurs in certain viruses, including rotaviruses. Reassortment involves the exchange of genome segments between two different viruses that infect the same host cell, resulting in the formation of a new virus particle with a unique combination of genome segments. This process can lead to the emergence of new viral strains with altered properties, such as increased virulence or changed antigenicity.

Rotaviruses are a type of double-stranded RNA virus that are known to undergo reassortment, which is an important mechanism for their evolution and adaptation. The other options, including cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and vaccinia virus, do not undergo reassortment in the same way as rotaviruses.",Success

"A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a β-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen. Which of the following mediators is described in this experimental study?",E,"The correct answer is D. IL-4.

The description of the experimental therapy suggests that it targets a mediator that promotes class switching of antibodies, which is a key feature of allergic responses. IL-4 is a cytokine that plays a crucial role in the development of allergic responses, including asthma. It promotes the class switching of antibodies from IgM to IgE, which is a key feature of allergic responses. IL-4 also promotes the production of other cytokines, such as IL-5, which recruits eosinophils to the site of inflammation, exacerbating asthmatic symptoms.

The other options are not directly related to the described mechanism:

A. IL-5 is involved in eosinophil recruitment, but it is not directly involved in class switching of antibodies.

B. IL-2 is a T-cell growth factor, but it is not directly related to allergic responses or class switching of antibodies.

C. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine that can suppress allergic responses, but it is not involved in class switching of antibodies.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. IL-4.",Success

A 65-year-old woman schedules an appointment with her physician for evaluation of weight loss and weakness. The weakness is more noticeable when climbing stairs and combing hair. The weakness improves after brief exercise. She also has bladder incontinence for the past 4 weeks and was given an anticholinesterase agent with no improvement. What is the most likely cause of the symptoms?,E,"The correct answer is D. Myasthenia gravis.

The symptoms described, such as weakness that improves after brief exercise, are consistent with myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction. The weakness in climbing stairs and combing hair suggests proximal muscle weakness, which is also characteristic of myasthenia gravis. The lack of improvement with anticholinesterase agents, which are typically used to treat myasthenia gravis, may indicate that the patient has a more severe or refractory form of the disease.",Success

His weight is in the 10th percentile. He is being evaluated for an immunodeficiency disease. Laboratory results for the HIV are negative by PCR. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Defective T cell function.

This patient's symptoms, including persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, and RSV pneumonia, are consistent with a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) disorder, which is characterized by defective T cell function. The fact that the patient's HIV test is negative by PCR suggests that the immunodeficiency is not due to HIV infection. SCID is a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the development and function of immune cells, including T cells and B cells. Defective T cell function is a hallmark of SCID, and it can lead to recurrent and severe infections, including opportunistic infections like candidiasis.",Success
"A 53-year-old man with recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma is enrolled in a clinical trial for a novel chemotherapeutic agent that his physician believes may be beneficial to his condition. The novel drug was previously tested in a small population and is now undergoing a larger phase 3 trial in preparation for FDA approval. A dose-response trial had the following results:

10 mg dose - 6/59 patients demonstrated improvement
20 mg dose - 19/49 patients demonstrated improvement
30 mg dose - 26/53 patients demonstrated improvement
40 mg dose - 46/51 patients demonstrated improvement

The same trial also had the following safety profile:

20 mg dose - 5/49 patients had a treatment related adverse event
40 mg dose - 11/51 patients had a treatment related adverse event
60 mg dose - 15/42 patients had a treatment related adverse event
80 mg dose - 23/47 patients had a treatment related adverse event
100 mg dose - 47/52 patients had a treatment related adverse event

Based on this study, which of the following represents the most likely therapeutic index for this novel chemotherapeutic agent?",E,"Correct Answer is: B. 0.5

Explanation: The therapeutic index is a measure of the safety of a drug, calculated as the ratio of the dose that produces a toxic effect to the dose that produces a therapeutic effect. In this case, we need to find the dose that produces a therapeutic effect (improvement in patients) and the dose that produces a toxic effect (treatment-related adverse events).

From the data, we can see that the dose that produces a therapeutic effect is around 40 mg, where 46/51 patients demonstrated improvement.

For the toxic effect, we can see that the dose that produces a significant number of treatment-related adverse events is around 100 mg, where 47/52 patients had an adverse event.

So, the therapeutic index would be the ratio of the toxic dose to the therapeutic dose, which is:

Therapeutic index = Toxic dose / Therapeutic dose
= 100 mg / 40 mg
= 2.5

However, this is not among the options. The closest option is 0.5, which would be the reciprocal of the actual therapeutic index (40 mg / 100 mg).

Therefore, the correct answer is B. 0.5.",Success

Blood salicylate levels return as normal. While you await other diagnostic tests, which of the following should be administered next to treat this patient?",E,"The correct answer is A. Ethanol.

The patient's symptoms, such as confusion, slurred speech, and ataxia, are consistent with Wernicke's encephalopathy, a condition caused by thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency. The urinalysis result showing a dark yellow or amber-colored urine with a low specific gravity is also suggestive of thiamine deficiency.

Thiamine deficiency is commonly seen in individuals with chronic alcoholism, malnutrition, or those who are homeless. The patient's history of public alcohol intoxication and recent homelessness supports this diagnosis.

Ethanol is used to treat Wernicke's encephalopathy because it can help replenish thiamine levels in the body. The other options are not relevant to the treatment of Wernicke's encephalopathy:

Endpoints Medication 1 Medication 2 P-Value
Primary: death from cardiac causes 134 210 0.03
Secondary: hyperkalemia 57 70 0.4
What is the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes? (Round to the nearest whole number.)",C,"The correct answer is C. 20.

To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), we need to find the absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the two groups. The ARR is the difference in the event rates between the two groups.

Event rate for Medication 1 (death from cardiac causes) = 134/1500 = 0.0893 (or 8.93%)
Event rate for Medication 2 (death from cardiac causes) = 210/1500 = 0.14 (or 14%)

ARR = Event rate for Medication 2 - Event rate for Medication 1 = 0.14 - 0.0893 = 0.0507 (or 5.07%)

To find the NNT, we take the reciprocal of the ARR and round to the nearest whole number:

NNT = 1 / 0.0507 ≈ 20

Therefore, the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes is approximately 20.",Success

The reticulocyte count is low at 0.2%, suggesting that the bone marrow is not producing enough red blood cells to compensate for the anemia. Given the patient's symptoms of fatigability and the laboratory findings, iron deficiency anemia is a likely cause. Therefore, a serum iron level test is required to investigate the cause of the anemia.",Success
"An 80-year-old man is transferred from a step-down unit to a med-surg floor in the hospital. He had undergone a successful hernia surgery 14 hours ago. Before the surgery, he was pre-treated with atropine, scopolamine, and morphine and recovered well in the PACU after the surgery. There were no complications in the step-down unit and the patient continued to recover. On the med-surg floor, his temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), the heart rate is 98/min, the respiratory rate is 15/min, the blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg, the oxygen saturation is 90%. On physical exam, he is a well-developed, obese man. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His incision site is clean, dry, and intact with an appropriate level of swelling and erythema. During the physical, the patient mentions some discomfort in his abdomen and pelvis and during a records review it is noted that he has not passed urine in the PACU, step-down unit, or since arriving on the med-surg floor. A bladder scan is inconclusive due to body habitus. What is the next best step in the treatment of this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Insert a ‘straight cath’ into the patient’s bladder.

The patient has not passed urine since the surgery, which suggests urinary retention. The bladder scan was inconclusive due to the patient's obesity, making it difficult to assess the bladder volume. Inserting a straight catheter (a type of urinary catheter) into the patient's bladder is the next best step to relieve the urinary retention and assess the volume of urine in the bladder. This is a common complication after surgery, especially in older adults, and prompt treatment is necessary to prevent further complications.",Success
"A healthy 19-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of painless “blisters” in his mouth. He reports that he noticed a white film on his tongue and the sides of his mouth 2 days ago while brushing his teeth. The film was easily brushed off. He also complains of a bitter metallic taste in his mouth but otherwise denies pain, burning, dysphagia, or hoarseness. He is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. He is a competitive swimmer and has had 8 sexual partners in the past year. He intermittently uses barrier protection. On exam, he is well-appearing and in no acute distress. His oral examination demonstrates patches of white pseudomembranes that can be wiped away to reveal erythematous mucosa. A medication with which of the following mechanisms of action is most appropriate in this patient?",A,"Correct Answer is: C. Inhibition of 14-alpha-demethylase.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with oral thrush (candidiasis), a fungal infection caused by Candida albicans. The white patches on the tongue and sides of the mouth that can be wiped away to reveal erythematous mucosa are characteristic of oral thrush.

The mechanism of action of the medication most appropriate for this patient is inhibition of 14-alpha-demethylase, which is the mechanism of action of azole antifungals such as fluconazole. Azole antifungals work by inhibiting the enzyme 14-alpha-demethylase, which is necessary for the synthesis of ergosterol, a critical component of the fungal cell membrane.",Success

An abdominal ultrasound shows surface nodularity compatible with cirrhosis but no other changes aside from ascites. An upper GI endoscopy is performed which shows gastric varices with no signs of active bleeding. An MRI of the brain is insignificant. What is the most likely precipitating factor that led to this patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

The patient's symptoms, such as abdominal distension, somnolence, and altered mental status, are consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver cirrhosis. The laboratory findings, including elevated ammonia levels, also support this diagnosis. The presence of ascites and gastric varices on ultrasound and endoscopy, respectively, further suggest that the patient has portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common complication of cirrhosis and ascites, and it can precipitate hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's fever and altered mental status are consistent with SBP, and the absence of other explanations for the patient's condition (such as variceal bleeding or portal vein thrombosis) makes SBP the most likely precipitating factor.",Success

"A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department for progressively worsening fatigue, malaise, fever, and abdominal pain. He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications. Which of the following will be the best treatment option for this patient?",C,"The correct answer is A. Adding dopamine to his treatment regimen.

The patient is experiencing oliguria (low urine output) in the setting of constant fluid intake, which suggests that he may be developing hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). HRS is a complication of cirrhosis and is characterized by renal failure and oliguria. The low urine sodium level and lack of blood or protein in the urine support this diagnosis.

Dopamine is a medication that can help improve renal perfusion and increase urine output in patients with HRS. It is often used in combination with albumin to help manage this condition.

The other options are not correct because:

* Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor that is not typically used to treat HRS.
* Liver transplantation is a long-term solution for patients with cirrhosis, but it is not a treatment for HRS.
* Switching cefotaxime to ceftriaxone may not affect the patient's oliguria, as the antibiotic choice is not related to the development of HRS.
* Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) is a procedure used to treat portal hypertension, but it is not a treatment for HRS.",Success

This patient is experiencing symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as anxiety, trouble sleeping, palpitations, and fatigue, which are consistent with an overactive thyroid gland. The physical exam findings of a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with thyroid bruits and laboratory results of a low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and elevated free thyroxine (FT4) level support this diagnosis.

In pregnancy, propylthiouracil is the preferred treatment for hyperthyroidism due to its ability to cross the placenta less than methimazole, which reduces the risk of fetal hypothyroidism. Radioiodine therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy, and thyroidectomy may be considered in some cases, but it is not the best initial treatment option. Observation is not a suitable option given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.",Success
"A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of intermittent loose stools and a 1.2-kg (2.6-lb) weight loss. She immigrated to the US from Uganda 6 weeks ago. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. The liver is firm and palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpable just below the left costal margin. Her leukocyte count is 12,800/mm3 (12% eosinophils). Stool culture shows several oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines. Microscopic examination of a liver biopsy specimen shows granulomatous inflammation with periportal fibrosis. Exposure to which of the following is most likely to have played a role in the development of this patient's symptoms?",E,"The correct answer is E. Freshwater snails.

The patient's symptoms, including intermittent loose stools, weight loss, and abdominal tenderness, are consistent with a parasitic infection. The presence of oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines in the stool culture suggests that the patient has a Schistosoma infection, which is commonly acquired through contact with contaminated freshwater, such as lakes, rivers, or ponds, in areas where the parasite is endemic. The liver biopsy findings of granulomatous inflammation with periportal fibrosis also support this diagnosis. Freshwater snails are an intermediate host for Schistosoma parasites, and exposure to them is likely to have played a role in the development of the patient's symptoms.",Success
"A 3-month-old girl is brought to a pediatrician by her parents. She has central cyanosis without signs of respiratory distress or signs of heart failure. An echocardiogram reveals severe pulmonary outflow obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy, a ventricular septal defect, and an overriding of the aorta. An elective primary surgical repair is planned at 4 months of age. Which of the following statements is true about this girl’s condition?",B,"Correct Answer is: B. Normal hemoglobin in patients with tetralogy of Fallot does not rule out iron deficiency anemia.

Explanation: Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect characterized by pulmonary outflow obstruction, ventricular septal defect, right ventricular hypertrophy, and an overriding aorta. In this condition, patients may have normal hemoglobin levels due to the increased red blood cell production in response to chronic hypoxia. However, they can still have iron deficiency anemia, which is a common complication of tetralogy of Fallot. Therefore, normal hemoglobin levels do not rule out iron deficiency anemia in these patients.",Success
"Six days after undergoing surgical repair of a hip fracture, a previously healthy 79-year-old woman is agitated and confused. She is unarousable during the day, but then is awake and impulsive during the night, requiring frequent reorientation. Her husband says that she usually drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly. Her only current medication is oxycodone for pain. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is distressed and oriented to person but not to place or time. Neurologic examination shows inattentiveness but no focal deficits. Urine dipstick is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her current condition?",D,"The correct answer is D, Delirium.

Delirium is a common condition in elderly patients, especially after surgery or hospitalization. It is characterized by a sudden change in mental status, inattention, disorientation, and fluctuating levels of consciousness. The patient's symptoms, such as agitation, confusion, inattentiveness, and disorientation, are consistent with delirium. The fact that she is awake and impulsive at night and requires frequent reorientation also supports this diagnosis.",Success
"A 54-year-old woman with a past medical history of mental retardation, hypertension, and diabetes presents to the emergency department with a change in her behavior. Her caretakers state that the patient’s gait suddenly became ataxic, and she became less responsive than her normal non-verbal baseline. Her temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 125/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an unremarkable HEENT exam with normal facial features and no signs of airway compromise. Neurological exam is remarkable for new onset spasticity. The patient has 3+ reflexes and a positive Babinski sign. Musculoskeletal exam is only notable for symmetric swelling and deformities of the patient’s hands bilaterally. Additionally, there is a ""clunk"" when posterior force is applied to the head while anterior force is applied to the cervical spine. Which of the following is the most likely risk factor that predisposed this patient to this condition?",E,"The correct answer is C. Down syndrome.

The patient's symptoms, such as ataxic gait, spasticity, and a positive Babinski sign, suggest a neurological disorder. The ""clunk"" when posterior force is applied to the head while anterior force is applied to the cervical spine is a classic sign of atlanto-axial instability, which is a common complication in patients with Down syndrome. The patient's history of mental retardation and symmetric swelling and deformities of the hands bilaterally also support this diagnosis.",Success
"A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after he sustained a stab wound to the left chest just below the clavicle. On arrival, he has rapid, shallow breathing and appears anxious. His pulse is 135/min, respirations are 30/min and shallow, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 80 mm Hg. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. Five minutes later, his pulse is 133/min and blood pressure is 82/45 mm Hg. Examination shows no active external bleeding. There is a 2.5-cm single stab wound to the left chest at the 4th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Cardiovascular examination shows muffled heart sounds and jugular venous distention. Breath sounds are normal. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?",C,"The correct answer is C. A drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as rapid and shallow breathing, anxiety, tachycardia, and hypotension, suggest a diagnosis of cardiac tamponade. The stab wound to the left chest is likely to have caused bleeding into the pericardial space, leading to compression of the heart and impaired cardiac function. The muffled heart sounds and jugular venous distension further support this diagnosis.

Cardiac tamponade is characterized by a drop in systolic blood pressure of 10-14 mmHg during inspiration, known as pulsus paradoxus. This is due to the increased pressure in the pericardial space during inspiration, which further compresses the heart and reduces cardiac output.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Tracheal deviation (A) would be more likely in a patient with a pneumothorax or hemothorax. Hemoptysis (B) is not typically associated with cardiac tamponade. Herniation of the stomach into the chest (D) would be more likely in a patient with a diaphragmatic injury. Paradoxical motion of part of the chest with breathing (E) is more characteristic of a flail chest, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.",Success
"A 40-year-old man presents to his primary-care doctor for a follow-up of his hypertension. He is asymptomatic at his office visit and denies any new complaints. He has a 10-year history of hypertension that remains poorly controlled on maximum doses of lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and amlodipine. His past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. He has no smoking history, drinks alcohol occasionally, and denies any illicit drug use. His father required a kidney transplant in his forties. The physical exam is notable for palpable flank masses bilaterally. Laboratory studies show a creatinine of 2.5. The physician orders a renal ultrasound, and the results are shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate test to screen for additional complications of this patient's condition?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, MR angiography of the brain.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease (PKD), which is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys. The palpable flank masses bilaterally and the elevated creatinine level support this diagnosis. PKD can also affect other organs, including the brain, where it can cause intracranial aneurysms. Therefore, the most appropriate test to screen for additional complications of this patient's condition is MR angiography of the brain to rule out intracranial aneurysms.",Success
"A 17-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her father because she has been experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain. She says that the chest pain is worse when she breathes or coughs. Furthermore, on the way to the hospital she noticed that there were specks of blood on a tissue that she coughed into.

After drug administration, the effects of the drug are monitored using a standard blood test. Surprisingly, the test results come back within normal parameters. The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms has which of the following modes of inheritance?",A,"Correct Answer is: A, Autosomal dominant

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and coughing up blood, suggest a pulmonary embolism. The large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels and the administration of intravenous treatment (likely heparin or another anticoagulant) support this diagnosis. The fact that the patient's test results come back within normal parameters after treatment suggests that the patient has a deficiency in antithrombin III, protein C, or protein S, which are all inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.",Success

Fetal blood group B, Rh-negative
Serum
Bilirubin, total 11.3 mg/dL
Direct 0.3 mg/dL
Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?""",E,"The correct answer is C. Anti-D antibodies.

The patient's symptoms, including jaundice and an enlarged liver and spleen, are consistent with hemolytic disease of the newborn. The laboratory results show a high reticulocyte count, indicating increased red blood cell production, and a positive anti-Rh antibody titer in the mother's blood, suggesting that the mother has developed antibodies against the Rh antigen on the fetus's red blood cells. This is consistent with hemolytic disease of the newborn caused by Rh incompatibility. The fact that the mother is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-negative rules out Rh incompatibility as the cause. However, the presence of anti-Rh antibodies in the mother's blood suggests that she may have been sensitized to the Rh antigen during a previous pregnancy, and these antibodies are now causing hemolysis of the newborn's red blood cells.",Success

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""",D,"The correct answer is D. Bacterial translocation.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is a complication of cirrhosis. The presence of fever, abdominal pain, and confusion, along with the physical examination findings of scleral icterus, spider angiomas, and ascites, are consistent with liver disease. The paracentesis results, including a low albumin concentration, high glucose concentration, and elevated leukocyte count with a high percentage of neutrophils, are also consistent with SBP.

Bacterial translocation is the most likely explanation for these findings, as it is a common complication of cirrhosis and can lead to SBP. Bacterial translocation occurs when bacteria from the gut enter the bloodstream and then infect the ascitic fluid. This can occur due to impaired gut motility, increased permeability of the gut wall, and decreased immune function, all of which are common in patients with cirrhosis.",Success

Laboratory evaluation confirms the diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Which of the following viral infections is most likely to have played a role in the pathogenesis of this patient’s malignancy?",B,"The correct answer is B, Epstein-Barr virus.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a well-established risk factor for the development of Hodgkin's lymphoma. EBV infection has been linked to the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's lymphoma, particularly in young adults. The virus can infect B cells and lead to the development of malignant clones. Studies have shown that EBV DNA is present in the tumor cells of many patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, and that EBV infection can contribute to the development of the disease.

The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's lymphoma:

A. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common viral infection that can cause a range of symptoms, but it is not typically associated with the development of Hodgkin's lymphoma.

C. Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that can cause adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, but it is not typically associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma.

D. Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) is associated with the development of Kaposi's sarcoma, a type of cancer that occurs in people with weakened immune systems, but it is not typically associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma.

E. Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) is associated with the development of certain types of cancer, including cervical cancer, but it is not typically associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma.",Success

Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""",A,"The correct answer is C. Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest an inflammatory myopathy, such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis. The presence of muscle weakness, soreness, and difficulty with swallowing solid foods, along with elevated creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, support this diagnosis. The muscle biopsy finding of perifascicular and perivascular infiltration is characteristic of polymyositis and dermatomyositis, and would confirm the diagnosis.

Option A is incorrect because intrafascicular infiltration is more characteristic of neurogenic disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Option B is incorrect because inflammation of synovial spaces on ultrasound is more characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis or other joint disorders.

Option D is incorrect because positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies are more characteristic of myasthenia gravis, a disorder of the neuromuscular junction.

Option E is incorrect because dystrophin gene mutation on genetic analysis is more characteristic of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy, which is a genetic disorder that affects children, not adults.",Success

A 55-year-old man with a history of chronic glomerulonephritis due to IgA nephropathy presents to your office with bone pain. Which of the following laboratory findings would you most expect upon analysis of this patient's serum?,A,"The correct answer is A. Increased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, decreased calcitriol.

This patient has chronic kidney disease due to IgA nephropathy, which can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism. The kidneys are unable to effectively excrete phosphate, leading to hyperphosphatemia. This, in turn, can cause hypocalcemia (decreased calcium levels) and decreased calcitriol (active vitamin D) production. The parathyroid glands respond to low calcium levels by increasing parathyroid hormone (PTH) production, which can contribute to bone pain.",Success
"A medical researcher is studying the physiology of the immune system in order to better understand the effects of HIV on patients. He isolates a group of cells that are shown by flow cytometry to be positive for the cell surface marker CD8. He then mixes this cell population with a group of infected cells, crosslinks extracellular interactions, and immunoprecipitates the CD8 protein. He identifies a protein bound to CD8 that is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell. Which of the following best describes the primary function of the protein that was most likely identified?",C,"Correct Answer is: C. Binds endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel

Explanation: The protein bound to CD8 is likely to be MHC class I, which presents endogenous peptides to CD8+ T cells. MHC class I molecules are composed of two chains (heavy chain and β2-microglobulin) and are responsible for presenting peptides derived from proteins synthesized within the cell to CD8+ T cells. The TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) channel plays a crucial role in transporting peptides from the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum, where they can be loaded onto MHC class I molecules.",Success

Serum adrenocorticotropin-releasing hormone (ACTH) 2 pg/mL (> 5 pg/mL)

A 48-hour high dose dexamethasone suppression trial shows that her serum cortisol levels do not decrease. What is the best next step in management?",A,"Correct Answer is: C. MRI of the pituitary gland

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest Cushing's syndrome, which is a hormonal disorder caused by excessive levels of cortisol in the body. The 24-hour urinary cortisol level is elevated, and the serum cortisol level is also high. The low ACTH level suggests that the cortisol excess is not driven by ACTH, which points to an adrenal tumor or autonomous adrenal cortisol production. The lack of suppression of cortisol levels with high-dose dexamethasone suggests that the cortisol production is not regulated by the normal feedback mechanisms.

The next step in management would be to localize the source of cortisol production. Given the low ACTH level, an adrenal tumor is less likely, and a pituitary tumor (Cushing's disease) is a more likely cause. An MRI of the pituitary gland would be the best next step to evaluate for a pituitary tumor.",Success

What is the most likely diagnosis?",C,"The correct answer is C. Bartter's syndrome.

The patient's symptoms, such as generalized weakness, increased urination, and increased thirst, are consistent with a diagnosis of Bartter's syndrome. The laboratory results, including elevated urinary calcium excretion, hypokalemia (low potassium levels), and elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration, also support this diagnosis.

Bartter's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired salt reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, leading to excessive salt loss in the urine. This results in hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and elevated plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentration.

The other options are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Renal artery stenosis would not typically cause hypokalemia or elevated urinary calcium excretion.

B. Primary hyperaldosteronism would cause hypertension, not hypokalemia, and would not typically be associated with elevated urinary calcium excretion.

D. Pheochromocytoma would cause hypertension, tachycardia, and other symptoms not present in this patient.

E. Gitelman's syndrome is a similar disorder to Bartter's syndrome, but it typically presents with hypocalciuria (low calcium levels in the urine) rather than hypercalciuria (elevated calcium levels in the urine).",Success

The specificity of the test is the number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives:

Specificity = 580 / (580 + 20) = 580 / 600 = 0.967 or 96.7%

So, the correct answer is E. 580 / (580 + 20).",Success

An excisional biopsy of a superficial axillary lymph node on the right is performed and a histopathologic analysis confirms the most likely diagnosis. Which of the following is the next best diagnostic step in the workup of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is D. Peripheral blood flow cytometry.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of lymphoma, likely diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) given the presence of fever, night sweats, and weight loss, as well as the laboratory findings of anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The excisional biopsy of the lymph node confirms the diagnosis.

The next step in the workup would be to perform peripheral blood flow cytometry to assess for any circulating lymphoma cells and to further characterize the lymphoma. This test would help to determine the extent of the disease and guide further treatment.",Success
"In order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?",E,"Correct Answer is: A, Lack of a comparison group

Explanation: The editor suggested that the study should be submitted as a case series instead of a cohort study because it lacks a comparison group. A cohort study typically involves a group of patients who receive a specific treatment or intervention (in this case, cerclage wiring) and are compared to a control group that does not receive the treatment. The study in question only followed a group of patients who received the treatment, without a control group for comparison. This lack of a comparison group is a key characteristic of a case series, which is a descriptive study that reports on a series of patients with a particular condition or treatment, without a control group.",Success

Explanation: When examining administrative data, the prevalence of a disease like SLE is typically estimated by counting the number of individuals with a diagnosis of SLE at any point during a specific time period. If the time period is shorter, it is more likely that individuals with a recent diagnosis will be included, even if they may not have had the disease for the entire time period. This can lead to an overestimation of the prevalence of SLE during shorter time windows. In contrast, examining longer time periods will provide a more accurate estimate of prevalence, as it will capture individuals who have had the disease for a longer period.",Success

"A 35-year-old woman is brought into the clinic by a concerned neighbor who says that the patient is often seen setting up bear traps all around her property because of an impending ‘invasion of the mole people.’ The patient has come to the clinic wearing a garlic necklace. She vaguely explains that the necklace is to mask her scent from the moles tracking her. She has no past psychiatric history and she denies hearing voices or seeing objects. No significant past medical history. Although she has lived in the same community for years, she says she usually keeps to herself and does not have many friends. She holds a regular job at the local hardware store and lives alone. Which of the following is the best initial course of treatment for this patient?",A,"The correct answer is D. A brief trial of antipsychotic therapy.

The patient's behavior and beliefs, such as setting up bear traps to protect herself from an ""invasion of the mole people"" and wearing a garlic necklace to mask her scent, suggest a delusional disorder. Delusional disorders are characterized by the presence of non-bizarre delusions that are not better explained by another mental disorder, such as schizophrenia. In this case, the patient's delusions are not accompanied by hallucinations or other symptoms of psychosis.

A brief trial of antipsychotic therapy is a reasonable initial course of treatment to help alleviate the patient's delusional symptoms. Antipsychotic medications, such as risperidone or olanzapine, can help reduce the intensity and frequency of delusions.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may also be helpful in addressing the patient's delusional beliefs, but it is not the best initial course of treatment. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is not indicated for delusional disorders, and referring the patient to outpatient group therapy may not be sufficient to address her symptoms. The patient does not require no intervention, as her delusional beliefs are causing her distress and impairment in her daily life.",Success

"The Kozak sequence for the Beta-globin gene has a known mutation which decreases, though does not abolish, translation of the Beta-globin mRNA, leading to a phenotype of thalassemia intermedia. What would the blood smear be expected to show in a patient positive for this mutation?",C,"The correct answer is C. Microcytic red blood cells.

Thalassemia intermedia is a condition characterized by a decrease in the production of beta-globin chains, leading to anemia and red blood cell abnormalities. The Kozak sequence mutation in the Beta-globin gene would result in decreased translation of the Beta-globin mRNA, leading to a deficiency of beta-globin chains. This would cause the red blood cells to be microcytic (smaller than normal) due to the reduced amount of hemoglobin.",Success

An x-ray of the chest shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy.

The patient's symptoms, including low back pain, weakness, and radiating pain to the left side, suggest spinal cord compression. The presence of a cough productive of blood-streaked sputum and weight loss suggests an underlying malignancy, likely lung cancer. The chest x-ray showing multiple round opacities in both lungs supports this diagnosis. The patient's neurologic examination shows signs of spinal cord compression, including hyperreflexia, Babinski sign, and decreased sensation below the T4 dermatome.

Intravenous dexamethasone therapy is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient to reduce spinal cord edema and relieve compression. Radiation therapy may also be necessary, but it is not the next immediate step. Intravenous acyclovir therapy is not indicated, as there is no evidence of a viral infection.

Medication is prescribed for his symptoms which changes his cardiac physiology as depicted with the dashed line recorded post-medication. What is the mechanism of action of the prescribed medication?",B,"Correct Answer is: C, Preferential dilatation of capacitance vessels

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest heart failure, likely due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The medication prescribed is likely a vasodilator, which reduces the preload on the heart by dilating capacitance vessels (veins). This would decrease the venous return to the heart, reducing the workload on the heart and alleviating symptoms of heart failure. The dashed line on the graph likely represents a decrease in ventricular pressure or volume, indicating a reduction in preload.",Success

A 27-year-old HIV positive female gave birth to a 7lb 2oz (3.2 kg) baby girl. The obstetrician is worried that the child may have been infected due to the mother's haphazard use of her anti-retroviral medications. Which of the following assays would a hospital use detect the genetic material of HIV if the child had been infected?,D,"The correct answer is D. Polymerase chain reaction.

Explanation: In this scenario, the hospital is concerned about the possibility of vertical transmission of HIV from the mother to the child. Since the child is born to an HIV-positive mother, it's essential to detect the presence of HIV genetic material in the child's blood as early as possible. 

The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay is a molecular diagnostic test that can detect the genetic material of HIV (viral RNA or DNA) in the child's blood. This test is highly sensitive and specific, making it an ideal choice for detecting HIV infection in infants. 

The other options are not suitable for this scenario:

A. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and C. Rapid HIV antibody test are used for screening HIV infection in adults, but they are not suitable for detecting HIV infection in infants because they detect antibodies against HIV, which may be present in the infant's blood due to maternal antibodies.

B. Western blot is a confirmatory test used to detect HIV antibodies in adults, but it's not suitable for detecting HIV infection in infants.

E. Southern blot is a laboratory technique used to detect specific DNA sequences, but it's not typically used for HIV diagnosis.",Success
"A 53-year-old man presents to his physician’s office with a persistent cough which he has had over the last few months. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the previous year and since then has been on a short-acting β-agonist to help alleviate his symptoms. Since his diagnosis, he has quit smoking, a habit which he had developed about 30 years ago. He used to smoke about 2 packs of cigarettes daily. Today, he has come in with an increase in his symptoms. He tells his physician that he has been having a fever for the past 3 days, ranging between 37.8°–39°C (100°F–102.2°F).

An MRI of the brain shows bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space. Which of the following is the most likely explanation of the patient's condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations.

The patient's symptoms, such as morning headaches, nausea, and vomiting, are consistent with increased intracranial pressure. The MRI findings of bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space suggest hydrocephalus. The recent history of meningitis (fever, irritability, and neck rigidity) suggests that the patient may have developed scarring or adhesions in the arachnoid granulations, which are responsible for reabsorbing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the bloodstream. This would lead to impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations, resulting in hydrocephalus.",Success

"A 22-year-old gravida 1 presents to her physician at 15 weeks gestation for a prenatal appointment. She complains of a rash involving her chest, face, and arms, a watery nasal discharge, and mild bilateral knee pain. She has had these symptoms for about 5 days. The symptoms do not seem to bother her too much, but she is concerned for the baby. She had contact with her younger sister, who also had a rash and was diagnosed with rubella infection about 10 days ago at a family gathering. She cannot confirm her vaccination history. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 89/min; respiratory rate, 12/min; and temperature, 37.6℃ (99.7℉). Examination shows a moderately dense maculopapular lacy rash spread over the patient’s trunk, extremities, and face. No lymph node, liver, or spleen enlargement is noted.

Serology performed 1 year ago Current serology
Rubella IgM - negative Rubella IgM - negative
Rubella IgG - 1:128 Rubella IgG - 1:64
Rubella IgG avidity - high Rubella IgG avidity - high
What is the proper next step in the management of this woman?",D,"Correct Answer is: A, Reassure and recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a viral infection, and her exposure to her sister with rubella infection raises concerns about rubella infection. However, the serology results show that the patient has a high level of rubella IgG antibodies with high avidity, indicating that she has had a previous rubella infection and is immune. The decrease in IgG titers from 1:128 to 1:64 is not significant, as it may be due to natural fluctuations. The absence of IgM antibodies rules out an acute infection. Therefore, the patient is not at risk of transmitting rubella to her fetus, and reassurance is appropriate. Vaccination against rubella is recommended postpartum to ensure she remains immune in the future.",Success

He was diagnosed with a gene defect on chromosome 7, which has caused dysfunction in a transmembrane protein. This defect has resulted in several hospitalizations for various respiratory infections. At the present time, he is struggling with a cough with thick purulent sputum. A sputum sample is sent for culture and the patient is started on vancomycin.The pediatrician tells the patient’s family that there is a collection of mucus in the respiratory tree which increases the patient's chances of future infections. He will have to undergo chest physiotherapy and they should report any signs of infection immediately to a medical professional. Which of the following pathogens will most likely infect this patient in adulthood?",B,"The correct answer is B. Pseudomonas.

The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that he has cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder caused by a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7. This defect leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus that clogs the airways and digestive tract, making it difficult to breathe and digest food.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common pathogen that infects the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis, particularly in adulthood. It is a Gram-negative bacterium that is resistant to many antibiotics and can cause chronic lung infections, which can lead to respiratory failure and other complications.

The other options are not as likely to infect this patient in adulthood:

A. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of skin infections, but it is not typically associated with cystic fibrosis.

C. Burkholderia cepacia is a Gram-negative bacterium that can infect people with cystic fibrosis, but it is less common than Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

D. Influenza is a viral infection that can affect anyone, but it is not specifically associated with cystic fibrosis.

"An 8-week-old male presents with his mother to the pediatrician for a well visit. The patient has been breastfed since birth, and usually feeds for 30 minutes every 2-3 hours. The patient’s mother is concerned that her milk production is not keeping up with the patient’s nutritional requirements. She reports that about two weeks ago the patient began regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds. She reports that he seems mildly upset during the episodes of regurgitation but usually settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. The patient’s mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of the regurgitation. She denies any diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. Her older son had a similar problem with vomiting that resolved around 12 months of age. Four weeks ago, the patient’s height and weight were in the 40th and 34th percentiles, respectively. His height and weight are now respectively in the 37th and 36th percentiles. On physical exam, the patient is cooing in his mother’s lap and smiles reciprocally with her. He lifts his head and shoulders off the examination table when placed in the supine position. His abdomen is soft, non-tender and non-distended. Bowel sounds are normoactive.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. Reassurance and counseling on positioning.

The patient's symptoms, such as regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds, are consistent with physiologic reflux, which is common in infants. The fact that the patient seems mildly upset during the episodes but settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards suggests that the reflux is not causing significant distress or discomfort. The mother's attempt to limit the volume of each feed has already reduced the frequency of the regurgitation, which further supports the diagnosis of physiologic reflux.

Reassurance and counseling on positioning, such as burping the baby during and after feeds, keeping the baby upright after feeds, and avoiding overfeeding, are likely to be effective in managing the symptoms. There is no indication for initiating proton pump inhibitors, obtaining an abdominal ultrasound, modifying the mother's diet, or switching to hydrolyzed formula at this point.",Success

The patient's symptoms are consistent with a left cord hemisection, also known as Brown-Séquard syndrome. This is a rare condition that occurs when there is a lesion or injury to one half of the spinal cord, resulting in a specific pattern of neurological deficits.

In this case, the patient has:

* Weakness in the left leg (motor deficit)
* Loss of vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity (sensory deficit)
* Loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right lower extremity (sensory deficit)

This pattern of deficits is consistent with a left cord hemisection, where the lesion affects the left half of the spinal cord, resulting in motor and sensory deficits on the same side, and sensory deficits on the opposite side.",Success
"A 58-year-old African American man presents for his yearly wellness visit. He says he has been unsuccessful at losing weight and would like help. His last colonoscopy was 8 years previously, which was normal. Past medical history is significant for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension. Current medications are isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine and aspirin 81 mg orally daily. He is also on CPAP to manage his OSA. The patient denies any history of smoking or recreational drug use and drinks 1 or 2 beers on weekends.

While observing sinus tachycardia on the patient's telemetry, you note that the radial pulse cannot be palpated during inspiration. What should be the next step in management of this patient?",B,"Correct Answer is: D, Pericardial window

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and EKG findings suggest cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. The radial pulse that cannot be palpated during inspiration is a sign of pulsus paradoxus, which is a characteristic feature of cardiac tamponade. A pericardial window is a surgical procedure that involves creating a window in the pericardium to drain the accumulated fluid and relieve the pressure on the heart. This is the next step in management of this patient.",Success

She has a 1-year history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and is allergic to shellfish. Her only medication is ranitidine. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 115/72 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Which of the following is the most likely pathogen?",E,"The correct answer is E. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.

The patient's symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weakness, are consistent with a bacterial gastroenteritis. The fact that she developed symptoms after eating the in-flight meal and had been staying at a resort in India, where the water and food may not have been properly sanitized, suggests that she may have contracted a foodborne or waterborne illness.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a common cause of traveler's diarrhea, particularly in developing countries like India. ETEC produces a heat-stable toxin that causes watery diarrhea, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms. The other options are less likely causes of the patient's symptoms:

A. Giardia intestinalis is a parasite that causes giardiasis, which typically presents with diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and weight loss. While it's possible that the patient may have contracted giardiasis, the rapid onset of symptoms after eating the in-flight meal makes ETEC a more likely cause.

B. Shigella species is a bacterium that causes shigellosis, which typically presents with bloody diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with shigellosis.

C. Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium that can cause food poisoning, but it typically presents with vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps within 1-6 hours of consuming contaminated food. The patient's symptoms developed after eating the in-flight meal, but the timing is not consistent with S. aureus food poisoning.

"A 65-year-old woman presented to the emergency room due to progressive dyspnea. She is a known hypertensive but is poorly compliant with medications. The patient claims to have orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and easy fatigability. On physical examination, the blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. There is prominent neck vein distention. An S3 gallop, bibasilar crackles, and grade 3 bipedal edema were also detected. A 2d echo was performed, which showed a decreased ejection fraction (32%). Which of the following drugs should not be given to this patient?",C,"Correct Answer is: C, Metoprolol

Explanation: The patient is presenting with symptoms of heart failure, including dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and easy fatigability. The physical examination findings of neck vein distention, S3 gallop, bibasilar crackles, and bipedal edema also support this diagnosis. The 2D echo showing a decreased ejection fraction (32%) further confirms heart failure.

Metoprolol is a beta-blocker, which can worsen heart failure by decreasing cardiac contractility and heart rate. In this patient, who is already hypotensive (blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg), metoprolol could further decrease blood pressure and worsen heart failure.

Furosemide, a diuretic, is often used to treat heart failure by reducing fluid overload. Nesiritide, a B-type natriuretic peptide, can help reduce fluid overload and improve cardiac function. Digoxin, a cardiac glycoside, can help improve cardiac contractility and reduce symptoms of heart failure.

""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.
Source of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health""",D,"The correct answer is D. It reflects a smaller sample size.

The medical student notices that the standard error surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups. This is likely due to the fact that the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group has a smaller sample size (202 participants) compared to the other two groups (388 participants in the pulmharkimab 75 mg/day group and 395 participants in the placebo group). A smaller sample size typically results in a larger standard error, which is a measure of the variability of the sample mean.",Success

Which of the following cells in the patient's liver were most likely damaged first?""",E,"Correct Answer is: E. Centrilobular hepatocytes

Explanation: The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, specifically ALT and AST, which are indicative of liver damage. The pattern of liver enzyme elevation, with ALT being higher than AST, suggests that the damage is more likely to hepatocytes rather than other liver cells. Centrilobular hepatocytes are the most susceptible to hypoxic injury, which is likely the cause of liver damage in this patient due to hypovolemic shock from rectal bleeding.",Success
"A 32-year-old man is brought by ambulance to the emergency room after being involved in a head-on motor vehicle collision at high speed.

"A 25-year-old female presents to urgent care with complaints of one day of burning and pain with urination, urgency, and frequency. She denies having a fever but has experienced intermittent chills. She is sexually active and inconsistently uses condoms. The patient has no past medical history. She is allergic to sulfa drugs. Physical examination of the genitalia is normal. Urinalysis shows positive leukocyte esterase and nitrites. The urine culture demonstrates gram-negative rods that form pink colonies on MacConkey agar. She is treated with an antibiotic and her symptoms quickly improve. The mechanism of the antibiotic she was most likely treated with is which of the following?",A,"The correct answer is A. Inhibits cell wall synthesis.

The patient's symptoms and urinalysis results suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by a gram-negative rod, likely E. coli. The fact that the urine culture demonstrates pink colonies on MacConkey agar further supports this diagnosis. Given the patient's allergy to sulfa drugs, she was likely treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic, such as amoxicillin or cephalexin, which inhibits cell wall synthesis.",Success
"A 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation comes to the physician for shortness of breath with mild exertion, progressive weakness, and a dry cough that has persisted for 6 months. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 45 years. His medications include warfarin, enalapril, and amiodarone. His pulse is 85/min and irregularly irregular. Physical examination shows enlarged fingertips and markedly curved nails. A CT scan of the chest shows clustered air spaces and reticular opacities in the basal parts of the lung. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's dyspnea?",E,"The correct answer is E. Excess collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix of the lung.

The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and CT scan results are consistent with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a condition characterized by scarring of the lungs. The patient's history of smoking, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation are also risk factors for IPF. The enlarged fingertips and curved nails (clubbing) are a common finding in patients with IPF. The CT scan findings of clustered air spaces and reticular opacities in the basal parts of the lung are also consistent with IPF. The underlying mechanism of dyspnea in IPF is the excess deposition of collagen in the extracellular matrix of the lung, leading to scarring and stiffening of the lung tissue.",Success

"In a study to determine the risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age (age < 30 years), 30 young patients with the condition are recruited into the study group. Sixty similar but healthy individuals are recruited into the control group. Educational status is considered to be an important variable, as it would affect the awareness of the disease and its risk factors among the participants. Based on the level of education, 2 groups are formed: low educational status and high educational status. A chi-square test is performed to test the significance of the relationship, and an odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9–9.7. What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?",A,"Correct Answer is: A. The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.

Explanation: The confidence interval (0.9-9.7) includes 1, which means that the association between low education and the risk of MI is not statistically significant. If the confidence interval did not include 1, it would suggest a statistically significant association. In this case, the odds ratio of 2.1 suggests that there may be a trend towards an association, but it is not strong enough to be considered statistically significant. Therefore, we cannot conclude that low education is a risk factor for MI in young individuals.",Success
"A 32-year-old primigravid woman at 16 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal visit. She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F) and blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 16-week gestation. A quadruple screening test shows maternal serum AFP of 3 times the median and normal levels of serum β-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A. Which of the following is most likely to account for these findings?",C,"The correct answer is C. Neural tube defect.

The quadruple screening test measures the levels of four substances in the maternal serum: alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), estriol, and inhibin A. Elevated levels of AFP are associated with neural tube defects, such as spina bifida or anencephaly. The patient's results show an AFP level of 3 times the median, which suggests a high risk of a neural tube defect.",Success
"A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of a sharp pain that radiates along his right hemithorax, which worsens with deep inspiration.

He works as a long-haul truck driver, and he informs you that he recently returned to the east coast from a trip to Utah. His medical history is significant for gout, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia from when he was a child. He currently smokes 2 packs of cigarettes/day, drinks a 6-pack of beer/day, and he denies any illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. His physical examination shows minimal bibasilar rales, but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, normal heart sounds, and a benign abdominal physical examination. Which of the following is the most reasonable 1st step towards ruling out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient?",C,"Correct Answer is: C. D-dimer

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as sharp pain radiating along the right hemithorax that worsens with deep inspiration, are consistent with pulmonary embolism (PE). Given the patient's low risk profile, the most reasonable first step towards ruling out PE would be to perform a D-dimer test. D-dimer is a sensitive but not specific test for PE, and a negative result can help rule out the diagnosis. If the D-dimer test is positive, further imaging studies such as a CT pulmonary angiogram or V/Q scan would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.",Success
"A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of her right hand. Specifically, she says that she was gardening 8 hours prior to presentation when she sustained a laceration over her distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. Since then, they have become red and swollen.

At the hospital, her temperature is 40.3°C (104.5°F), blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical exam, the patient appears to have altered mental status and her skin is dry, hot, and erythematous. She is complaining of severe bilateral flank pain and generalized myalgia. Catheterization produces 200 mL of tea-colored urine. Urine dipstick is positive for blood, but urinalysis is negative for RBCs or WBCs. Which of the following is most likely responsible for her condition?",D,"The correct answer is D. Heat stroke.

The patient's symptoms, such as altered mental status, dry and hot skin, and severe bilateral flank pain, are consistent with heat stroke. The tea-colored urine and positive dipstick for blood, but negative urinalysis for RBCs or WBCs, suggest rhabdomyolysis, which is a common complication of heat stroke. The patient's family history of chronic kidney disease, bilateral hearing loss, and vision problems may be related to a genetic disorder, but it is not directly responsible for her current condition.

Heat stroke is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's temperature regulation system is overloaded, causing the body temperature to rise rapidly. It is often seen in individuals who engage in strenuous physical activity in hot weather, such as military recruits. The patient's collapse during basic training on a hot day, along with her symptoms, makes heat stroke the most likely diagnosis.",Success

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Gastric peptic ulcer

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of epigastric discomfort and cramping pain, especially after meals, and her history of avoiding eating due to these symptoms, suggest a diagnosis of gastric peptic ulcer. The fact that she is a smoker and takes over-the-counter painkillers, which can irritate the stomach lining, further supports this diagnosis.",Success
"A 19-year-old female college soccer player presents to a sports medicine clinic with right knee pain. One day prior she twisted her right knee and felt a “pop” while chasing after a ball. She has since felt severe throbbing knee pain and noticed a rapid increase in swelling around her knee. She is able to bear weight but feels “unstable” on her right leg. On exam, anterior drawer and Lachman’s tests are positive. The physician informs her that she has likely injured an important structure in her knee. What is the function of the structure that she has most likely injured?",B,"The correct answer is B. Prevent excess anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including a positive anterior drawer and Lachman's test, suggest that she has likely injured her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). The ACL is a crucial structure in the knee that prevents excess anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur, providing stability to the knee joint.",Success
"Six hours after birth, a newborn boy is evaluated for tachypnea. He was delivered at 41 weeks' gestation via Caesarian section and the amniotic fluid was meconium-stained. His respiratory rate is 75/min. Physical examination shows increased work of breathing. X-rays of the abdomen and chest show no abnormalities. Echocardiography shows elevated pulmonary artery pressure. He is started on an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP, and there is immediate improvement in his tachypnea and oxygenation status. Three hours later, the newborn is tachypneic and there is blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this infant's cyanosis?",C,"Correct Answer is: C. Oxidization of Fe2+ to Fe3+

Explanation: The newborn boy's symptoms and response to treatment suggest that he has persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). The inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP is likely nitric oxide, which is used to treat PPHN. The improvement in tachypnea and oxygenation status after treatment suggests that the medication was effective in reducing pulmonary artery pressure. However, the subsequent development of cyanosis, characterized by blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes, is likely due to methemoglobinemia. This is a known side effect of inhaled nitric oxide therapy, which can oxidize Fe2+ to Fe3+, leading to the formation of methemoglobin. Methemoglobin is unable to bind oxygen, resulting in cyanosis.",Success

"A medical student decides to join an immunology research center, which specifically works on capsular polysaccharide vaccine development against bacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. As a member of a research team working on the Hib vaccine, he asks his senior colleague why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers like tetanus toxoid during vaccine development. Which of the following is the best response to this question?",E,"Correct Answer is: E, Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.

Explanation: Capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers like tetanus toxoid during vaccine development to improve their immunogenicity, particularly in infants. This conjugation process helps to convert a T-cell-independent antigen (polysaccharide) into a T-cell-dependent antigen, which can stimulate a more robust and long-lasting immune response, including the production of IgG antibodies. This is especially important for infants, who have an immature immune system and may not respond well to polysaccharide-only vaccines.",Success
An investigator is studying the pattern of glutamate release from presynaptic nerve terminals in human volunteers with Alzheimer disease. The concentration of glutamate in the CA1 region of the hippocampus is measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy after Schaffer collateral fibers are electrically stimulated. Which of the following events most likely occurs immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters?,E,"The correct answer is E. Influx of calcium.

Here's why:

In the process of neurotransmitter release, an electrical signal (action potential) reaches the presynaptic terminal, causing an influx of calcium ions through voltage-gated calcium channels. This influx of calcium triggers the release of neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, from the presynaptic terminal into the synaptic cleft.

The other options are not directly related to the event that occurs immediately prior to neurotransmitter release:

A. Activation of G protein-coupled receptors is a downstream effect of neurotransmitter binding, not a step leading up to release.

B. Synthesis of glutamine is a metabolic process that occurs in glial cells, not directly related to neurotransmitter release.

C. Accumulation of cAMP is a second messenger pathway that can modulate neurotransmitter release, but it's not a direct precursor to release.

D. Opening of ligand-gated ion channels occurs in the postsynaptic neuron, not in the presynaptic terminal, and is a response to neurotransmitter binding, not a step leading up to release.",Success

She currently denies any headaches, vision changes, nausea or vomiting, or neck stiffness. Her physical exam is within normal limits. Her vital signs are stable. She is prescribed rifampin for prophylaxis with specific instructions on when to follow up if symptoms develop. When asked about the possibility of pregnancy, she mentioned that she uses combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for contraception. The physician suggested that her husband should use condoms for contraception as she requires antibiotic therapy. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the need for additional contraception?",A,"The correct answer is A. Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens.

Rifampin, an antibiotic used for meningococcal meningitis prophylaxis, can reduce the effectiveness of combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) by altering the gut flora that participates in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens. This can lead to a decrease in estrogen levels, making the OCPs less effective as a contraceptive. Therefore, the physician recommends additional contraception, such as condoms, to prevent unintended pregnancy.",Success

After this, the patient became irritable and had difficulty breathing, suggesting an allergic reaction, which was immediately treated with epinephrine. This patient is otherwise healthy, and her history does not indicate any health conditions or known allergies. The physician suspects an immunodeficiency disorder that was not previously diagnosed. If serum is taken from this patient to analyze her condition further, which of the following would be expected?",C,"Correct Answer is: C. Low IgA, normal IgG, and IgM

Explanation: The patient's reaction to the blood transfusion, which included irritability and difficulty breathing, suggests an allergic reaction. The fact that the patient had no known allergies or health conditions prior to this event suggests an underlying immunodeficiency disorder. The most likely diagnosis is selective IgA deficiency, which is a common immunodeficiency disorder that can cause an allergic reaction to blood transfusions. In this condition, the patient would have low or absent IgA levels, but normal levels of IgG and IgM.",Success
"A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being found unconscious in his apartment by his mother. On arrival, he is unable to provide history.

"A 30-year-old G4P3 woman at 38 weeks gestation is admitted to the labor and delivery unit complaining of contractions every 5 minutes for the past hour. Her previous births have been via uncomplicated caesarean sections, but she wishes to attempt vaginal delivery this time. Her prenatal care is notable for gestational diabetes controlled with diet and exercise. The delivery is prolonged, but the patient's pain is controlled with epidural analgesia. She delivers a male infant with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Fundal massage is performed, but the placenta does not pass. The obstetrician manually removes the placenta, but a red mass protrudes through the vagina attached to the placenta. The patient loses 500 mL of blood over the next minute, during which her blood pressure decreases from 120/80 mmHg to 90/65 mmHg. What is the best next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Elevate posterior fornix.

The patient is experiencing a postpartum hemorrhage due to a placenta accreta, which is a condition where the placenta grows too deeply into the uterine wall and does not separate normally after delivery. The red mass protruding through the vagina attached to the placenta is likely a portion of the placenta that has invaded the uterine wall.

Elevating the posterior fornix is a technique used to help control bleeding in cases of placenta accreta. It involves manually pushing the posterior fornix (the upper part of the vagina) upwards and backwards to compress the bleeding vessels and help control the hemorrhage. This is often done in conjunction with other measures to control bleeding, such as uterotonics and blood transfusions.

Uterine artery ligation (A) may be considered in some cases of postpartum hemorrhage, but it is not the best next step in this scenario. Hysterectomy (B) may ultimately be necessary, but it is not the initial management step. Intravenous oxytocin (C) is not likely to be effective in controlling bleeding in this scenario, as the placenta is not separating normally. Red blood cell transfusion (E) may be necessary to treat the patient's blood loss, but it is not the best next step in managing the bleeding.",Success

"A 64-year-old male with a past medical history of two myocardial infarctions presents to the emergency room with shortness of breath. He notes that he stopped taking his furosemide two weeks prior, because he ran out of pills. On exam, his oxygen saturation is 78%, his lungs have crackles throughout, and jugular venous pulsation is located at the earlobe. EKG and troponin levels are normal. Which of the following is consistent with this man's pulmonary physiology?",E,"The correct answer is D. Increased Aa gradient, normal surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance.

Explanation:

The patient presents with shortness of breath, crackles in the lungs, and jugular venous distension, which are all consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). The fact that he stopped taking his furosemide (a diuretic) two weeks prior suggests that he has developed fluid overload, leading to pulmonary edema.

In pulmonary edema, the alveolar-capillary membrane becomes thickened, increasing the diffusion distance and impeding gas exchange. This leads to an increase in the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (Aa gradient), which is the difference between the oxygen tension in the alveoli and the oxygen tension in the arterial blood.

The surface area for diffusion is not affected in pulmonary edema, as the alveoli are still present and functional. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Increased Aa gradient, normal surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance.",Success

She is slightly jaundiced. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her blood work shows normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin. Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies are also ruled out. A Coombs test is negative. Red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal. The physician determined that these findings are related to an enzyme deficiency. Which of the following allosterically inhibits this enzyme?",A,"The correct answer is B. Adenosine diphosphate.

The symptoms described in the question, such as lethargy and irritability between meals, are consistent with hypoglycemia. The laboratory results, including normocytic anemia, elevated reticulocyte count, and decreased haptoglobin, suggest a diagnosis of pyruvate kinase deficiency, a rare genetic disorder that affects the enzyme pyruvate kinase.

Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in glycolysis, and its deficiency leads to impaired glucose metabolism and hemolytic anemia. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is an allosteric inhibitor of pyruvate kinase, meaning that it binds to the enzyme and reduces its activity. This inhibition helps to regulate glycolysis and prevent excessive glucose breakdown.",Success

What is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Muellerian agenesis.

The patient's physical examination shows normal breast development, axillary hair, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5, indicating normal estrogenization. The lab results also show normal estradiol levels, which further supports normal estrogen production. The FSH level is within the normal range, which rules out primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). The presence of normal testosterone levels also makes androgen insensitivity unlikely.

The patient's symptoms of primary amenorrhea (no menstruation) and mild intermittent lower abdominal pain, along with the refusal of a vaginal examination, suggest that the patient may have a structural abnormality of the reproductive tract. Muellerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, is a congenital anomaly characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the uterus, cervix, and upper part of the vagina. This diagnosis is consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.",Success
"A 62-year-old woman with a pancreatic insulinoma is being prepared for a laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor.

Needle-shaped birefringent crystals are observed in the joint aspirate. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient’s condition?",A,"The correct answer is A. Organic acids competing with urate for tubular secretion.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with acute gouty arthritis. The presence of needle-shaped birefringent crystals in the joint aspirate is a characteristic feature of gout. The patient's history of binge drinking and smoking may have contributed to the development of gout.

Option A is the correct answer because organic acids, such as lactic acid and ketones, can compete with urate for tubular secretion in the kidneys, leading to increased urate reabsorption and decreased urate excretion. This can contribute to the development of hyperuricemia and gout.

Option B is incorrect because increased renal reabsorption of urate would not be caused by the patient's lifestyle habits.

Option C is incorrect because lysis of large numbers of cells would not typically cause gout.

Option D is incorrect because a deficiency of HGPRT (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase) is a rare genetic disorder that can cause gout, but it is not the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition.

Option E is incorrect because while a high-purine diet can contribute to the development of gout, it is not the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition.",Success
"A 33-year-old man presents to the infectious diseases clinic for follow-up. He was recently admitted to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and cough, and was found to have Pneumocystic jirovecii pneumonia and a new diagnosis of HIV. His CD4 count is 175, viral load is pending. As part of routine laboratory studies given his new diagnosis, an RPR was found to be positive with a titer of 1:64, and this is confirmed with a positive FTA-ABS. He is unsure when or how he acquired HIV or syphilis. His neurological examination is normal, and he has no symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management:",C,"Correct Answer is: C. Treat with three weekly injections of penicillin, obtain titers in 6 months.

Explanation: The patient has a new diagnosis of HIV and syphilis, and the RPR test is positive with a titer of 1:64, which is confirmed by a positive FTA-ABS. The patient is asymptomatic and has a normal neurological examination. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that patients with HIV and syphilis be treated with three weekly injections of benzathine penicillin G, and that titers be obtained at 6 months to assess treatment response. This is because HIV-infected individuals may have a slower response to treatment and may require more frequent monitoring.",Success
"A 67-year old man presents to his primary care physician for his yearly checkup. He has not noticed any major changes in his health over the last year but says that unfortunately, he stopped exercising because he has been stressed by work. His past medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipidemia. He is taking a number of drugs but does not remember what they are. A panel of metabolic and lipid tests are ordered and show worsening of his metabolic parameters. Based on these findings, his physician prescribes a drug that leads to a large decrease in triglycerides with a much smaller increase in high-density lipoproteins and decrease in low-density lipoproteins. The drug that was most likely prescribed in this case is associated with which of the following side effects?",B,"The correct answer is D. Hepatotoxicity.

The description of the patient's condition and the effects of the prescribed drug suggest that the drug is a fibrate, such as fenofibrate or gemfibrozil. These drugs are commonly used to treat hypertriglyceridemia and are known to decrease triglycerides and increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, while also decreasing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. However, fibrates are also associated with a risk of hepatotoxicity, which is a potential side effect.",Success
"A 29-year-old woman presents to her OB/GYN for a preconception visit. She wishes to become pregnant within the next several months. A thorough history reveals that the patient suffers from phenylketonuria (PKU). She recalls being instructed by prior physicians to follow a diet that avoids certain foods; however, she admits to not being complaint with these recommendations. Laboratory testing reveals a plasma phenylalanine level of 20.2 mg/dL (normal range <2 mg/dL). Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. 3 months prior to conception, begin a restricted diet to lower phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL.

This is because women with phenylketonuria (PKU) need to strictly control their phenylalanine intake before and during pregnancy to prevent birth defects and intellectual disability in their offspring. The recommended plasma phenylalanine level for women with PKU who are planning to become pregnant is below 6 mg/dL. Therefore, the patient should start a restricted diet 3 months prior to conception to achieve this goal and minimize the risks to her future pregnancy.",Success
"A 47-year-old man presents to his family physician with a sudden onset of severe pain and redness in his eyes that started this morning. He is having difficulty seeing properly and is extremely worried about losing his vision. Further history reveals that he has had progressive lower back pain for over 2 months now. The pain is usually at its worst in the morning, but it remains throughout the day. It gets better with movement, however, so he tends to do some light exercises every day. He also has heel pain and feels significant pressure while walking. Laboratory analysis reveals increased ESR and CRP serum levels. Which of the following would most likely be seen in this patient?",D,"Correct Answer is: B, Conjunctivitis

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including sudden onset of severe eye pain and redness, difficulty seeing, and progressive lower back pain, are consistent with a diagnosis of acute anterior uveitis and ankylosing spondylitis. The laboratory results showing increased ESR and CRP serum levels support this diagnosis. Conjunctivitis is a common feature of ankylosing spondylitis, and it is likely to be seen in this patient.",Success
"A 38-year-old woman presents to her physician’s clinic for recurrent episodes of chest pain that wakes her from her sleep. While usually occurring late at night, she has also had similar pains during the day at random times, most recently while sitting at her desk in her office and at other times while doing the dishes at home. The pain lasts 10–15 minutes and resolves spontaneously. She is unable to identify any common preceding event to pain onset. The remainder of her history is unremarkable and she takes no regular medications. She works as an accountant. There is no history of smoking or drug use, however, she does consume 5 alcoholic drinks per week. Examination reveals: pulse 70/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg. A physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following would be effective in reducing her symptoms?",C,"The correct answer is C. Isosorbide dinitrate.

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""",B,"The correct answer is C. Gastrointestinal fluid loss.

The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, weakness, and dizziness, along with the physical examination findings of whitening of the tongue and delayed skin turgor, suggest dehydration. The laboratory results show a high serum osmolality and a high urine osmolality, which is consistent with dehydration. The patient's history of taking hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, may have contributed to the dehydration, but it is not the primary cause. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are more consistent with gastrointestinal fluid loss due to vomiting, which has led to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.",Success

"Accurate and rapid identification of individuals with tuberculosis (TB) is crucial to accomplishing the goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to eliminate this disease. One of the key strategies for the detection of TB is the use of tuberculin skin testing as a globally pertinent screening method, due to its low cost and technical simplicity. A study from Brazil demonstrated 76.7% accuracy, 67.9% sensitivity, 84.4% specificity, 79.1% positive predictive value, and 75% negative predictive value when using 5-mm skin elevation as a threshold, or cut-off, point for the screening test (following intradermal injection). Lowering the cut-off point to 4 mm would also result in an increase in which test property?",D,"Correct Answer is: D. Negative predictive value.

Explanation: Lowering the cut-off point from 5 mm to 4 mm would increase the sensitivity of the test, which means more true positives would be detected. As a result, the number of false negatives would decrease, leading to an increase in the negative predictive value (NPV). NPV is the proportion of individuals with a negative test result who do not have the disease.",Success
"A 55-year-old caucasian male is transferred to a tertiary care hospital from a small county hospital where he presented with jaundice and severe abdominal pain that radiates to the back.

"A one-week-old, full-term infant born by uncomplicated vaginal delivery is brought to a pediatrician by his mother, who notes that her daughter's skin appears yellow. She reports that the child cries several times per day and sleeps 7-8 hours at night, uninterrupted. She has been breastfeeding exclusively and feels that he has been feeding well. Which of the following is the best treatment for this condition?",E,"The correct answer is E. Continue normal breast feeding.

This is a case of physiologic jaundice, which is a common and normal condition in newborns. The symptoms described, such as yellow skin, crying, and sleeping patterns, are consistent with physiologic jaundice. Breast milk jaundice is a type of physiologic jaundice that occurs in breastfed babies, and it is not a cause for concern.

Phototherapy (A) is used to treat pathologic jaundice, not physiologic jaundice. Phenobarbital administration (B) is not indicated for jaundice treatment. Plasma exchange (C) is a treatment for severe cases of jaundice, but it is not necessary for physiologic jaundice. Switching from breast milk to formula (D) is not recommended, as breast milk is the best nutrition for babies, and physiologic jaundice is a normal and harmless condition. Continuing normal breast feeding (E) is the best course of action, as it will help the baby to continue to receive the benefits of breast milk and will allow the jaundice to resolve on its own.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman arrives to the clinic complaining of progressive urinary leakage that has occurred for the past 1 year. At first, she would notice leakage only during athletic exercise, but now the incontinence occurs even when she laughs or coughs. The patient states that she goes to the bathroom more frequently to try to prevent “wetting myself.” She wakes up once a night to urinate. She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she “needs to focus.” The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use. Pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable. When that patient is asked to Valsalva, leakage of urine is observed. A urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Urethral hypermobility

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of urinary leakage, especially during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure (such as laughing, coughing, or exercising), suggest stress urinary incontinence. The observation of urine leakage during the Valsalva maneuver further supports this diagnosis. Urethral hypermobility, which is a common cause of stress urinary incontinence, is likely the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.",Success

Red blood cells: Positive
Glucose: Negative

Which of the following is the best next step in management?",C,"The correct answer is C. IV fluids and mannitol.

The patient's symptoms, including altered mental status, confusion, and a positive urine dipstick test for red blood cells, suggest a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, which is a condition characterized by muscle breakdown and release of muscle enzymes into the bloodstream. The presence of benzodiazepines and marijuana in the toxicology screen may have contributed to the patient's altered mental status, but they do not explain the positive urine dipstick test for red blood cells.

The best next step in management is to administer IV fluids and mannitol to help flush out the muscle enzymes and prevent kidney damage. Diazepam (A) may be used to treat benzodiazepine withdrawal, but it is not the best next step in this scenario. Electroencephalography (B) may be used to evaluate for seizure activity, but it is not indicated in this case. Phenytoin (D) is an anticonvulsant medication that may be used to treat seizures, but it is not indicated in this case.

An x-ray of the spine shows a wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""",B,"The correct answer is B. Secondary hyperparathyroidism.

The patient's symptoms, such as severe back pain and tenderness over the L2 vertebra, are consistent with a compression fracture. The laboratory results show elevated potassium and creatinine levels, indicating chronic kidney disease. The wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra on the x-ray is also consistent with this diagnosis.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a common complication of chronic kidney disease, where the parathyroid glands produce excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone in response to low calcium levels and high phosphate levels. This can lead to bone resorption and an increased risk of fractures.

Tertiary hyperparathyroidism (A) is a rare condition that occurs when secondary hyperparathyroidism is left untreated and the parathyroid glands become autonomous. Elder abuse (C) is unlikely given the patient's medical history and lack of other signs of abuse. Pseudohypoparathyroidism (D) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the response to parathyroid hormone, but it is not consistent with the patient's laboratory results. Primary hyperparathyroidism (E) is a condition where the parathyroid glands produce excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone due to a benign tumor or hyperplasia, but it is not typically associated with chronic kidney disease.",Success
"A 50-year-old man comes to the physician because of swelling of his legs for 2 months. Three months ago, he was diagnosed with hypertension and started on a new medication. His blood pressure is 145/95 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 2+ edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. This patient was most likely treated with which of the following drugs?",E,"The correct answer is E. Amlodipine.

The patient's symptoms of leg swelling (edema) and the fact that he was recently started on a new medication for hypertension suggest that the medication is causing the edema as a side effect. Amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is a common antihypertensive medication that can cause peripheral edema as a side effect.",Success
An investigator is studying the function of different enzymes in various human cell types. A subset of normal human cells with an elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase is harvested and isolated. Which of the following is most likely to be absent in these cells?,A,"The correct answer is D. Lactic acid dehydrogenase.

Bisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme involved in the glycolytic pathway, specifically in the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. An elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase would suggest an increased activity of the glycolytic pathway.

Lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, which is the final step of anaerobic glycolysis. If the cells have an elevated concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase, it is likely that they are favoring the glycolytic pathway and producing more pyruvate, which would then be converted to lactate by LDH. Therefore, it is likely that LDH would be absent or reduced in these cells to prevent the accumulation of lactate.

The other options are not directly related to the glycolytic pathway or the function of bisphosphoglycerate mutase:

A. α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is an enzyme involved in the citric acid cycle.

B. Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme involved in the glycolytic pathway, but it is not directly related to bisphosphoglycerate mutase.

C. Glutathione reductase is an enzyme involved in the antioxidant defense system.

E. Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme involved in the regulation of pH and CO2 transport.",Success
"A 28-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room after a motor vehicle accident. On arrival, she is stable and says that she hit a car at an intersection that ""came out of nowhere"". She states that she had similar close encounters with other cars these past few weeks but was able to avoid collisions with those. She has also had intermittent headaches over the last month and has noticed that her shirts have been getting wet unexpectedly. Blood tests reveal an abnormal elevation of a circulating substance. Which of following changes is also associated with the physiologic function of the most likely substance in this case?",B,"Correct Answer is: D. Increased human chorionic gonadotropin

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as frequent close encounters with other cars, suggest a lack of attention or distraction while driving. The intermittent headaches and wet shirts are indicative of galactorrhea (spontaneous milk production). The combination of these symptoms points to a possible diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia, which can be caused by a pituitary tumor or, in this case, pregnancy. The elevated circulating substance is likely human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is produced during pregnancy. The physiologic function of hCG is to stimulate the corpus luteum to continue producing progesterone, which maintains the pregnancy. Therefore, the correct answer is D, Increased human chorionic gonadotropin.",Success
"A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of episodic headaches associated with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Over-the-counter pain medications have failed to reduce her symptoms. An MRI of the brain shows isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle. This dilatation is most likely caused by blockade of which of the following structures?",B,"The correct answer is B, Interventricular foramen.

The patient's symptoms and MRI findings suggest a condition called unilateral hydrocephalus, where one of the lateral ventricles is enlarged. The most likely cause of this is a blockade of the interventricular foramen (also known as the foramen of Monro), which connects the lateral ventricle to the third ventricle. This blockade prevents cerebrospinal fluid from flowing normally, leading to the dilation of the lateral ventricle.",Success

"A 21-year-old female presents to the office after a health screening in which she was found to have high blood pressure. At the office, the blood pressure is 168/114 mm Hg. You have seen the patient in the past for amenorrhea and infertility issues, but she denies taking any medication at this time. On examination, the patient is short and normal weight but has a webbed neck. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the elevated blood pressure?",A,"The correct answer is C. Neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal gland.

The patient's symptoms, including high blood pressure, amenorrhea, and infertility, are consistent with Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder caused by a missing or partially deleted X chromosome. The physical examination finding of a webbed neck is also a characteristic feature of Turner syndrome. In this case, the most likely cause of the elevated blood pressure is a neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal gland, which is a common complication of Turner syndrome.",Success
A 25-year-old African American man presents to his primary care provider for routine blood work. He is a well-known case of sickle cell disease treated with hydroxyurea and tramadol as needed for pain. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. The patient asks if his disease can adversely affect his kidneys because his friend was recently diagnosed with end-stage renal failure. Which of the following is a renal complication of sickle cell disease?,E,"The correct answer is E. Impaired urine concentration ability.

Sickle cell disease can cause several renal complications, including impaired urine concentration ability, which is a common finding in patients with sickle cell disease. This is due to the damage caused by sickling of red blood cells in the renal medulla, leading to a decrease in the ability of the kidneys to concentrate urine.",Success
"A gunshot victim is brought to the Emergency Department and appears to be in shock. You note a penetrating wound at the level of L3. Assuming the bullet remained at this level, which vascular structure might have been injured?",A,"The correct answer is A. Inferior vena cava.

The level of L3 is near the lower lumbar region, where the inferior vena cava (IVC) is located. The IVC is a major blood vessel that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower body to the heart. A penetrating wound at this level could potentially injure the IVC, leading to significant bleeding and shock.",Success
"A clinical trial is conducted to test the efficacy of a new drug, A, to treat tinea versicolor. A total of 500 participants are recruited for the study and are randomized into 2 groups in equal numbers. Group 1, the study treatment group, is given drug A, while group 2, the control group, is given the current standard antifungal therapy. After the completion of therapy, 190 participants from the study treatment group and 165 participants from the control group are cured. Which calculation below represents the number needed to treat for the new drug?",B,"The correct answer is B. 250/25.

To calculate the number needed to treat (NNT), you need to find the difference in the number of cured participants between the study treatment group and the control group, and then take the reciprocal of that difference.

First, calculate the difference in the number of cured participants:

190 (study treatment group) - 165 (control group) = 25

This means that 25 more participants were cured in the study treatment group compared to the control group.

Next, calculate the total number of participants in the study treatment group:

250 (half of the total 500 participants)

Now, take the reciprocal of the difference:

250 / 25 = 10

So, the number needed to treat (NNT) is 10, which means that 10 patients need to be treated with drug A to cure one additional patient compared to the standard antifungal therapy.",Success

On physical exam, he is found to be anxious but does not have any visible injuries other than the lacerations. Which of the following processes would most likely be seen in this patient?",E,"Correct Answer is: E, Increased norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node

Explanation: The patient is anxious and has a normal blood pressure, which suggests that he is experiencing a stress response to the motor vehicle accident. This stress response is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system, which releases norepinephrine. Norepinephrine acts on the sinoatrial node to increase heart rate, which is consistent with the patient's pulse of 82/min.",Success
"A 14-year-old teenager presents to his pediatrician complaining of frequent headaches and excessive fatigue during soccer practice. His mother notes that he seems to have gained a lot of weight despite the fact that he eats a healthy, well-balanced diet. His teachers have also become concerned because he leaves class to use the restroom frequently throughout the day. He has no medical problems and family history is insignificant. A physical exam is significant for a short, overweight child with nonpitting edema and decreased reflexes. His systolic blood pressure drops by 20 mm Hg when he stands. Fundoscopic exam is significant for papilledema and visual field exam is significant for bitemporal hemianopsia. Laboratory findings include:
BUN 22 mg/dL N: 7–20 mg/dL
pCO2 32 mm Hg N: 35–45 mm Hg

Free T4 6 pmol/L N: 10–20 pmol/L
What is the necessary treatment?",D,"Correct Answer is: D, Surgical resection

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Cushing's disease, which is caused by a pituitary adenoma producing excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The symptoms include weight gain, fatigue, headaches, and frequent urination. The physical exam findings of nonpitting edema, decreased reflexes, and papilledema are also consistent with this diagnosis. The laboratory findings of low sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate levels, as well as elevated BUN and creatinine levels, are also consistent with Cushing's disease.

The necessary treatment for Cushing's disease is surgical resection of the pituitary adenoma. This is the most effective way to remove the source of excess ACTH production and alleviate the patient's symptoms. Hormone replacement therapy may be necessary after surgery to replace the hormones that are no longer being produced by the pituitary gland. Chemotherapy and radiation are not typically used to treat Cushing's disease.",Success
"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?",E,"Correct Answer is: E. A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.

Explanation: The researcher wants to detect HIF-1α in RCC under normoxic conditions. Since RCC can inhibit HIF-1α hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia, HIF-1α will not be degraded and will accumulate in the cells. A Western blot is a technique that detects proteins, so it will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control cell. Northern blot detects RNA, and Southern blot detects DNA, so they are not relevant to detecting HIF-1α protein levels.",Success

"A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department after being stabbed 12 times in various parts of his body. Paramedics report extensive blood loss at the scene where he was found. Due to his Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, an endotracheal airway and large-bore access are secured prior to arrival. He is aggressively resuscitated with a massive transfusion protocol as the operating room is prepared for an exploratory laparotomy. An arterial line and central access are obtained. His temperature is 95°F (35°C), blood pressure is 50/40 mmHg, and pulse is 80/min, and respirations are controlled at 20/min on lung-protective volume control. After a 6:6:1 ratio of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets and the use of continuous phenylephrine infusion, the patient's vital signs remain the same. The surgical team reports no active blood loss. A stat ScvO2 results as 39% with a SaO2 of 100% on 100% oxygen. His extremities remain cold despite having the ambient room temperature increased to 80°F (26.7°C). What is the most likely cause of his presentation?",A,"The correct answer is C. Occult hemorrhage.

The patient's presentation is consistent with hypovolemic shock due to blood loss, despite aggressive resuscitation efforts. The fact that the surgical team reports no active bleeding suggests that the bleeding may have stopped, but the patient's vital signs remain unstable. The low ScvO2 (central venous oxygen saturation) of 39% indicates inadequate tissue perfusion, which is consistent with ongoing hypovolemia. The patient's cold extremities despite a warm ambient temperature also suggest poor peripheral perfusion. The lack of response to vasopressor therapy (phenylephrine infusion) further supports the diagnosis of occult hemorrhage, as the patient's blood pressure remains low despite adequate vasopressor support.",Success

"A 40-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe left upper quadrant pain (duration 3 hours, stabbing quality, 10/10 on the pain scale). Past medical history is significant for sickle cell anemia. Physical examination is significant for severe tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant. Significant splenomegaly is also noted. The patient is admitted to the hospital for close observation and placed on deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis as part of a routine protocol. Laboratory findings drawn sometime after admission demonstrate a normal prothrombin time (PT) and elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Which of the following factors is most directly affected by the DVT prophylaxis?",D,"The correct answer is B. XIIa.

The patient is on DVT prophylaxis, which typically involves the use of heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin. These medications work by activating antithrombin III, which in turn inhibits factor XIIa (also known as Hageman factor). This inhibition prevents the formation of thrombin and ultimately prevents the formation of blood clots.

The elevated PTT (partial thromboplastin time) suggests that the DVT prophylaxis is affecting the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, which involves factors XII, XI, IX, and VIII. Factor XIIa is a key component of this pathway, and its inhibition by heparin would lead to an elevated PTT.

The other options are not directly related to the DVT prophylaxis:

A. VII is a factor involved in the extrinsic pathway of coagulation, which is not affected by heparin.

C. VIIa is an activated form of factor VII, which is also involved in the extrinsic pathway and not directly affected by heparin.

D. X is a factor involved in the common pathway of coagulation, which is not specifically targeted by heparin.

E. XII is the zymogen form of factor XII, which is activated to XIIa. While heparin does affect factor XIIa, the correct answer is XIIa, not XII.",Success

Here's why:

* The patient's symptoms, such as shortness of breath, bilateral crackles, and pitting edema, suggest heart failure.
* The additional heart sound after S2 (S3 or S4) is also consistent with heart failure.
* Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a hormone released by the heart in response to increased pressure and volume. Elevated BNP levels are often seen in heart failure.
* Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is released in response to decreased blood volume or pressure. In heart failure, ADH levels may be elevated to help retain water and increase blood pressure.
* Sodium levels are often low in heart failure due to increased ADH and water retention.
* Potassium levels may also be low due to increased aldosterone levels, which can occur in heart failure.

Therefore, the lab values that most likely correspond to this patient's presentation are high BNP, high ADH, low sodium, and low potassium.",Success

The patient's symptoms, including blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae, joint hypermobility, and decreased tone, are consistent with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder characterized by brittle bones and other connective tissue abnormalities. The incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis and the patient's inability to stand or crawl after a minor trauma also support this diagnosis. OI is caused by mutations in the genes that encode type I collagen, leading to insufficient production of procollagen type 1.",Success
"A 21-year-old man comes to the emergency room with swelling and severe pain in his left lower leg that started 2 hours ago. He has no history of serious illness or trauma. His father has a history of pulmonary embolism. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily since he started college 3 years ago. He appears very distressed. He is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 92 kg (203 lb); BMI is 30.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a tender and mildly swollen left lower leg; dorsiflexion of the left foot causes severe pain in the calf. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 184,000/mm3, a prothrombin time of 11 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 26 seconds, and positive fibrin split products. Ultrasonography of the left leg shows incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow. The patient is administered a 5000 IU intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin followed by a constant infusion. Six hours later, the activated partial thromboplastin time is 30 seconds.

"An 80-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of fatigue and lightheadedness. He does not have chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing. He has a history of hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and asthma. Current medications include simvastatin, metformin, lisinopril, albuterol, and ibuprofen. His pulse is 48/min and blood pressure is 89/50 mm Hg. He responds slowly to questions but is oriented to person, place, and time. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. His lungs are clear to auscultation and bowel sounds are positive with no pulsatile masses or bruits. Pedal pulses are nonpalpable, distal extremities are cold, and capillary refill time is 4 seconds. An ECG shows left axis deviation, a Q wave in lead III, a constant PR interval of 0.15 seconds with every third P wave that is nonconducted, and a QRS interval of .09 seconds. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",D,"The correct answer is D. Cardiac pacing.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue and lightheadedness, along with his physical examination findings of bradycardia (heart rate of 48/min), hypotension (blood pressure of 89/50 mm Hg), and signs of decreased peripheral perfusion (cold distal extremities, nonpalpable pedal pulses, and prolonged capillary refill time), suggest that he is experiencing hemodynamic instability due to a bradyarrhythmia.

The ECG findings of a constant PR interval of 0.15 seconds with every third P wave that is nonconducted suggest a diagnosis of Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. This type of block can cause symptoms of bradycardia and hemodynamic instability, especially in older adults.

Given the patient's symptoms and ECG findings, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform cardiac pacing to increase the heart rate and improve cardiac output. This can be done temporarily with a transcutaneous pacemaker or permanently with a pacemaker implantation. The other options, such as dopamine, dobutamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, are not indicated in this scenario as they are primarily used to increase blood pressure and cardiac output in patients with shock or cardiogenic shock, rather than to treat bradyarrhythmias.",Success
"In a small town with a population of 10,000 people, the prevalence of alcohol use is estimated to be 30%. A study is done with a null hypothesis that there is no association between alcohol use and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The data obtained shows, of the 200 alcoholics who were followed-up, 30 developed GERD; and out of the 400 non-alcoholics, 30 developed GERD. What fraction of GERD can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed in this town?",A,"The correct answer is A. 45/195.

To calculate the fraction of GERD that can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed, we need to calculate the attributable risk (AR) of alcohol use on GERD.

First, let's calculate the incidence of GERD in alcoholics and non-alcoholics:

Incidence of GERD in alcoholics = 30/200 = 0.15
Incidence of GERD in non-alcoholics = 30/400 = 0.075

The attributable risk (AR) is the difference in incidence between the exposed group (alcoholics) and the unexposed group (non-alcoholics):

AR = Incidence in alcoholics - Incidence in non-alcoholics
= 0.15 - 0.075
= 0.075

The population attributable risk (PAR) is the proportion of GERD cases in the general population that can be attributed to alcohol use:

PAR = (Prevalence of alcohol use x AR) / Incidence of GERD in the general population
= (0.3 x 0.075) / (60/1000)
= 45/195

Therefore, if alcohol is no longer consumed in this town, 45/195 of GERD cases can be prevented in the general population.",Success

On physical examination, a mild conjunctival pallor is evident, and the rectum is erythematous, indurated, and tender. Colonoscopy demonstrates continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon. What is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Ulcerative colitis.

The patient's symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, cramping, grossly bloody stool, and an urge to defecate, are consistent with inflammatory bowel disease. The colonoscopy findings of continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon also support this diagnosis. Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that typically affects the rectum and colon, causing inflammation and ulceration of the mucosa. The patient's history of bulimia with laxative abuse may have contributed to the development of ulcerative colitis, but it is not the primary diagnosis.",Success

The ribosome is an essential organelle that plays an important role in the synthesis of new proteins. The location of the ribosome within the cell can vary and provides a clue to the function of the particular cell. What ribosome location is essential for protein-secreting cells?,A,"The correct answer is A. Rough endoplasmic reticulum.

In protein-secreting cells, such as pancreatic cells or plasma cells, the ribosomes are typically found attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). The RER is a type of endoplasmic reticulum that has ribosomes attached to its surface, and it plays a crucial role in the synthesis and transport of proteins that are destined for secretion or insertion into membranes. The ribosomes attached to the RER translate messenger RNA (mRNA) into protein, and the newly synthesized proteins are then translocated into the RER lumen for further processing and transport.",Success

The cervix is dilated to 5 cm, 70% effaced, and the station of the head is -2. A fetal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",A,"The correct answer is C. Initiate nifedipine therapy.

The patient is experiencing frequent contractions and is at 26 weeks' gestation, which indicates preterm labor. The goal of management is to delay delivery to allow for fetal maturation. Nifedipine is a tocolytic medication that can help relax the uterus and slow down contractions, allowing for a delay in delivery. This is the most appropriate next step in management.

Allowing vaginal delivery (Option A) is not appropriate at this gestational age, as the fetus is not yet mature enough to survive outside the womb. Misoprostol (Option B) is a medication that can induce labor, which is the opposite of what is needed in this situation. Performing a cesarean delivery (Option D) may be necessary if the fetus is in distress or if the mother's life is at risk, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. Performing dilation and evacuation (Option E) is not relevant to this situation, as it is a procedure typically used for terminating a pregnancy, not for managing preterm labor.",Success

Which of the following best explains these findings?",A,"The correct answer is A. Kwashiorkor.

Kwashiorkor is a form of protein-energy malnutrition that is common in children who have inadequate nutrition, often due to poverty, conflict, or displacement. The symptoms described in the question, such as pitting edema, abdominal swelling, irritability, and difficulty arousing, are consistent with kwashiorkor. The presence of ascites and hepatomegaly also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the fact that the child has missing teeth suggests a lack of adequate nutrition, which is a hallmark of kwashiorkor.

Marasmus (option B) is another form of protein-energy malnutrition, but it typically presents with a more emaciated appearance, whereas kwashiorkor is characterized by edema and swelling.

Beriberi (option C) is a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1) that can cause edema, but it is not typically associated with protein-energy malnutrition.

Rickets (option D) is a condition caused by vitamin D deficiency, which can lead to bone deformities, but it is not typically associated with edema or abdominal swelling.

Scurvy (option E) is a deficiency of vitamin C, which can cause fatigue, malaise, and bleeding gums, but it is not typically associated with edema or abdominal swelling.",Success

"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?",A,"Correct Answer is: C, Lead-time bias

Explanation: Lead-time bias occurs when a diagnostic test appears to improve outcomes because it detects a condition earlier, but the earlier detection does not actually change the natural course of the disease. In this case, if the conclusion that initial ultrasonography is associated with better outcomes is due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point-of-care ultrasound, it would be an example of lead-time bias. The earlier detection of nephrolithiasis may not actually change the outcome, but it would appear to do so because of the earlier detection.",Success

Her pulse is 88/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 144/90 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm without any signs of ischemia. Serum cardiac markers are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress.

The patient's symptoms, such as intermittent painful retrosternal dullness, shortness of breath, and palpitations, are suggestive of angina pectoris, which is a classic symptom of coronary artery disease. The fact that the symptoms are triggered by exertion and cold weather, and resolve with rest, further supports this diagnosis. The patient's risk factors, including hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a history of smoking (although she currently does not smoke), also increase her likelihood of having coronary artery disease.

A myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress is a non-invasive test that can help diagnose coronary artery disease by assessing blood flow to the heart muscle.

There is marked tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic region and right lower quadrant, with voluntary guarding but no rebound. Pelvic exam shows moderate purulent discharge in the vaginal vault, cervical motion tenderness, and a tender adnexal mass on the right side. Which of the following is the best next step in treating this patient’s condition?",B,"The correct answer is B. Intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline with inpatient admission.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination suggest a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is a serious infection of the female reproductive organs. The patient's recent treatment with ciprofloxacin for a urinary tract infection may have contributed to the development of PID. The presence of purulent discharge, cervical motion tenderness, and a tender adnexal mass on the right side support this diagnosis.

Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the risk of complications, such as tubo-ovarian abscess or sepsis, inpatient admission and intravenous antibiotics are necessary. Cefotetan and doxycycline are appropriate antibiotics for the treatment of PID, covering a range of potential pathogens including Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and anaerobes.

Option A is incorrect because outpatient management is not sufficient for this patient's condition, and intramuscular ceftriaxone may not provide adequate coverage for anaerobic organisms. Option C is incorrect because vancomycin is not typically used to treat PID, and outpatient follow-up is not sufficient for this patient's condition. Option D is incorrect because methotrexate is not an antibiotic and is not used to treat PID. Option E is incorrect because exploratory laparotomy is not the initial treatment of choice for PID, and may be reserved for cases that are refractory to medical therapy or have complications such as a tubo-ovarian abscess.",Success
"A 72-year-old man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital for the evaluation of breathlessness and fatigue. His pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Further evaluation shows a systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg × min/L with an end-systolic volume of 80 mL. Which of the following describes the ejection fraction in this patient?",E,"The correct answer is C. 35%.

Explanation: The patient's end-systolic volume is 80 mL, and the normal end-systolic volume is around 50-60 mL. The ejection fraction (EF) is calculated as:

EF = (End-diastolic volume - End-systolic volume) / End-diastolic volume

Since the end-diastolic volume is not provided, we can use the formula:

EF = (Stroke volume / End-diastolic volume) × 100

The stroke volume can be estimated from the cardiac output (CO) and heart rate (HR):

CO = HR × Stroke volume

Given the patient's pulse is 100/min, and the systemic vascular resistance is 35 mm Hg × min/L, we can estimate the cardiac output to be around 5-6 L/min (normal range). Assuming a stroke volume of around 60-70 mL (normal range), we can calculate the ejection fraction:

EF = (60-70 mL / 120-140 mL) × 100 ≈ 35-40%

Therefore, the closest answer is C. 35%.",Success

She has copious thin and watery nasal mucus. The physician suggests replacing diphenhydramine with fexofenadine to improve her drowsiness. What characteristic of fexodenadine allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine?",D,"The correct answer is D. Relative lipophobicity.

Fexofenadine is a non-sedating antihistamine, which means it is less likely to cause drowsiness compared to diphenhydramine. This is due to its relative lipophobicity, which refers to its low ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. As a result, fexofenadine has a lower affinity for the central nervous system and is less likely to cause sedation.",Success
"A 55-year-old male visited his primary care physician complaining of chest pain and progressive shortness of breath worsened by exertion. His vital signs were within normal limits. He reports that he worked in a naval shipyard for 10 years during his twenties. A CT scan of his chest shows diffuse thickening of the pleura and a diagnosis of mesothelioma is made.

"A 56-year-old man recently diagnosed with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use presents to the clinic for a follow up evaluation. He states that he has abstained from alcohol and attends a support group regularly. He has not taken any new medications or encountered any sick contacts. The patient's blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 15/min. His physical exam is grossly unremarkable. He has brought an gastroduodenoscopy report for review, which reveals that the patient has small esophageal varices with red spots. What is the next best step to prevent bleeding?",D,"The correct answer is D. Nadolol.

The patient has small esophageal varices with red spots, which indicates a high risk of bleeding. Non-selective beta blockers, such as nadolol, are commonly used to prevent bleeding from esophageal varices in patients with cirrhosis. They work by reducing portal pressure and decreasing the risk of variceal bleeding.

Endoscopic sclerotherapy (A) and ligation (B) are both used to treat bleeding varices, but they are not the next best step in preventing bleeding in this patient. Metoprolol (C) is a selective beta blocker that is not typically used for this indication. Repeating the endoscopy (E) may be necessary for surveillance, but it is not the next best step in preventing bleeding.",Success
"A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife for incomprehensible speech. Upon first inspection you note the man is drooling and his eyes are tearing excessively. The patient's wife explains that the man was tilling the fields on the family beet farm when she found him collapsed on a pile of freshly picked beets. The patient seemed confused so the wife brought him in promptly, and states it has only been ten minutes since the patient was found down in the fields. Physical exam is deferred due to a confused and combative patient who is speaking clearly yet his sentences do not make any sense. The patients clothes are removed in the ED. Vital signs are currently being obtained. Which of the following is the best initial step in management?",D,"Correct Answer is: A, Sublingual atropine drops

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including incomprehensible speech, drooling, and excessive tearing, are consistent with organophosphate poisoning, which is a common hazard in agricultural settings. The best initial step in management is to administer sublingual atropine drops to counteract the muscarinic effects of the organophosphate.",Success
"A 75-year-old man presents to the physician for his annual blood pressure visit and blood work. He has no complaints other than occasional knee pain. The past medical history includes hypertension. He has had knee osteoarthritis for several years and takes occasional acetaminophen for pain control. His diet is full of vegetables. He exercises every day. He has no history of smoking. He had a brother who died at the age of 84 due to hematologic malignancy. The temperature is 36.8℃ (98.2℉), and the blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. The physical examination shows no abnormalities other than a reduced range of motion and crepitus in both knees. The laboratory test results are as follows:
Hemoglobin 15 g/dL
Leukocyte count 58,000/mm3
Platelet count 250,000/mm3
Flow cytometry on the peripheral blood reveals an absolute lymphocyte count of 50,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",A,"The correct answer is A. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

The patient's laboratory results show a significantly elevated leukocyte count (58,000/mm3) with a high absolute lymphocyte count (50,000/mm3). This suggests a lymphoproliferative disorder, and the most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow, characterized by an abnormal increase in mature lymphocytes. The patient's age, lack of symptoms, and normal physical examination also support this diagnosis.

Monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL) is a precursor condition to CLL, but it is typically characterized by a lower absolute lymphocyte count (<5,000/mm3). Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a condition characterized by the presence of a monoclonal protein in the blood, but it is not typically associated with an elevated leukocyte count. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow, but it is typically characterized by anemia, bone lesions, and an abnormal protein in the blood, which are not present in this patient. Polycythemia vera (PV) is a condition characterized by an overproduction of red blood cells, which is not consistent with the patient's laboratory results.",Success
A 60-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of cough productive of yellow sputum with occasional streaks of blood. He has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. He is afebrile. Pulmonary examination shows inspiratory crackles at the left infraclavicular area. An x-ray of his chest shows a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning. A sputum sample does not grow acid-fast bacteria despite multiple cultures. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?,D,"The correct answer is D. Opportunistic colonization.

The patient's symptoms, such as coughing up yellow sputum with blood streaks, and the presence of a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning, suggest the presence of a lung lesion. The fact that the sputum sample does not grow acid-fast bacteria despite multiple cultures rules out active tuberculosis. The most likely cause of this patient's condition is opportunistic colonization, which means that the patient has a lung cavity or lesion that has become colonized by bacteria or fungi, leading to the symptoms and radiographic findings.",Success

A researcher hypothesizes that low birth weight is related to obesity later in life. He conducts a study with a 95% confidence interval with a p-value of 0.049 to disprove his null hypothesis. He rejects his null hypothesis and concludes that low birth weight is associated with obesity. Which of the following statements best associates with his study?,B,"Correct Answer is: E. A type 1 error has been made.

Explanation: The researcher rejects the null hypothesis with a p-value of 0.049, which means there is a 4.9% chance of observing the result (or a more extreme result) assuming that the null hypothesis is true. This is below the typical significance level of 0.05, so the researcher concludes that there is a statistically significant association between low birth weight and obesity. However, this also means that there is a 4.9% chance of making a type 1 error, which is the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis. Therefore, the correct answer is E. A type 1 error has been made.",Success
"A 52-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for abdominal pain and diarrhea. The patient states that she has been experiencing watery diarrhea for weeks now. During this same period she states she has been constantly thirsty and does not have the same energy levels that she once had.

His mother has been giving him ibuprofen at night for “growing pains,” but his symptoms have not improved. One week before the pain started, the patient was hit in the thigh by a baseball, which caused his leg to become red and swollen for several days. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. His gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. A biopsy of the left femur shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",D,"The correct answer is D. Ewing sarcoma.

The symptoms and laboratory findings in this case are consistent with Ewing sarcoma, a type of bone cancer that typically affects children and adolescents. The patient's progressive leg pain, tenderness along the femur, and abnormal laboratory results (elevated leukocyte count and ESR) are all indicative of a malignant bone tumor. The x-ray findings of multiple lytic lesions and new bone formation are also consistent with Ewing sarcoma. The biopsy result of small round blue cells further supports this diagnosis.",Success
"A 55-year-old male with a history of stage I colon cancer status-post left hemicolectomy presents to your office for follow-up. You intend to discuss the results from his recent surveillance colonoscopy, which showed no remaining cancer, no polyps, and a well-healed anastmosis. During your meeting, you note that the patient is exhibiting the defense mechanism of suppression. Which of the following statements from the patient is consistent with your impression?",E,"The correct answer is E. ""I really haven't thought about the colonoscopy until today. Worrying before getting the results wasn't going to help anything.""

Suppression is a defense mechanism in which an individual consciously pushes unpleasant or anxiety-provoking thoughts or feelings out of their awareness. The patient's statement in option E is consistent with suppression because they are acknowledging that they deliberately avoided thinking about the colonoscopy results until the appointment, implying that they were trying to avoid anxiety or worry.",Success

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",E,"The correct answer is B. Nitrofurantoin.

The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) as evidenced by the positive leukocyte esterase, WBCs, and nitrites in the urinalysis. The presence of Enterobacter in the urine culture also supports this diagnosis. 

Nitrofurantoin is a suitable antibiotic for treating UTIs, especially in elderly patients, as it is less likely to cause Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea and has a lower risk of selecting for resistant organisms. Additionally, it is effective against Enterobacter.

TMP-SMX (A) is not a good choice due to the patient's age and the risk of hyperkalemia. Levofloxacin (C) is a fluoroquinolone that can cause tendon rupture and is not a first-line agent for UTIs in elderly patients. Cephalexin (D) is a cephalosporin that may not be effective against Enterobacter. No treatment is not necessary (E) because the patient has a UTI that requires antibiotic treatment.",Success

His pulse is 124/min and pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 90%. He weighs 50-kg (110-lb). A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is suspected and intravenous heparin is initiated. If the volume of distribution of heparin is equivalent to 60 mL/kg and the target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL, which of the following is the most appropriate loading dose for this patient?",B,"Correct Answer is: B, 1,500 units

Explanation: To calculate the loading dose of heparin, we need to know the volume of distribution (Vd) and the target peak plasma concentration (Cp). The formula to calculate the loading dose is:

Loading dose = Vd x Cp

Given values:
Vd = 60 mL/kg
Cp = 0.5 units/mL
Patient's weight = 50 kg

First, calculate the volume of distribution in mL:
Vd (mL) = 60 mL/kg x 50 kg = 3000 mL

"A 3-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician for evaluation because his parents have been concerned by a number of troubling signs. Specifically, they have noticed that he has been exhibiting aggressive behavior as well as hyperactivity. In addition, he has had intellectual disability and is slow to hit developmental milestones. Physical exam reveals coarse facies, short stature, and joint stiffness. Eye exam reveals no abnormalities of the cornea or lens. Based on these findings, the patient is referred to a geneticist for further evaluation. Which of the following substances would most likely accumulate in the cells of this patient?",D,"The correct answer is D. Heparan sulfate.

The symptoms described in the question, such as aggressive behavior, hyperactivity, intellectual disability, coarse facies, short stature, and joint stiffness, are consistent with Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), a group of lysosomal storage disorders. The accumulation of heparan sulfate, a type of glycosaminoglycan, is a hallmark of MPS.

MPS is caused by a deficiency of enzymes involved in the breakdown of glycosaminoglycans, leading to their accumulation in cells. The specific type of MPS that matches the symptoms described is likely to be MPS I (Hurler syndrome), which is characterized by the accumulation of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate.

The other options are not directly related to the symptoms described:

A. Cerebroside sulfate is a type of glycolipid that accumulates in metachromatic leukodystrophy, a different lysosomal storage disorder.

"An investigator is studying the frequency of polycythemia in a population of a remote, mountainous region. A representative sample of 100 men shows a normal distribution of hemoglobin concentration with a mean concentration of 17 g/dL and a standard error of 0.1 g/dL. Which of the following best represents the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL?",B,"Correct Answer is: E. 5%

Explanation: Since the distribution of hemoglobin concentrations is normal, we can use the 68-95-99.7 rule to determine the probability. The mean is 17 g/dL, and the standard error is 0.1 g/dL. To find the standard deviation, we can multiply the standard error by the square root of the sample size (100): SD = 0.1 x √100 = 1 g/dL.

A hemoglobin concentration of 18 g/dL is 1 standard deviation above the mean. According to the 68-95-99.7 rule, about 68% of the data points fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean, which means about 32% of the data points fall outside of 1 standard deviation. Since the distribution is symmetrical, half of these (16%) will be above 1 standard deviation, and half will be below. However, we are interested in the probability of a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL, which is more than 1 standard deviation above the mean. This corresponds to the upper tail of the distribution, which is approximately 5% of the data points.",Success

An investigator is studying bacterial adaptations to the environment in an infectious isolate and a noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B. Animals exposed to the noninfectious isolate do not develop symptoms of infection. The investigator cultivates the noninfectious isolate in a culture with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate. Some of the animals exposed to these bacteria develop symptoms of infection. Which of the following processes is most likely responsible for the described findings?,C,"The correct answer is C. Transformation.

The scenario described in the question suggests that the noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B acquired genetic material from the infectious isolate, which allowed it to become infectious. This is consistent with the process of transformation, where free DNA from one bacterium is taken up by another bacterium, allowing for the transfer of genetic information.

Conjugation (A) involves the direct transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another through a specialized structure called a pilus. Reassortment (B) is a process that occurs in viruses, where genetic material is exchanged between different viral strains. Generalized transduction (D) is a process where a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria) accidentally picks up bacterial DNA and transfers it to another bacterium. Recombination (E) is a broader term that refers to the exchange of genetic material between different DNA molecules, but it is not the most specific answer in this case.",Success

During the physical exam, the physician finds that the patient is hypertensive. Serum analysis reveals hyperglycemia. The physician suspects a pituitary adenoma. Which dexamethasone test result would help confirm the physician's suspicions?",E,"The correct answer is B. Low-dose, increased ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH.

This question is related to Cushing's syndrome, which is caused by excess cortisol production. The physician suspects a pituitary adenoma, which would lead to an increase in ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) production, stimulating the adrenal glands to produce more cortisol.

The dexamethasone suppression test is used to diagnose Cushing's syndrome. In this test, a low dose of dexamethasone is administered, and if ACTH levels increase, it suggests that the pituitary gland is producing excess ACTH, which is consistent with a pituitary adenoma. If a high dose of dexamethasone is then administered and ACTH levels decrease, it confirms that the pituitary adenoma is responsive to feedback inhibition, which is a characteristic of pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Low-dose, increased ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH.",Success

Scintigraphy reveals the most common pathologic condition associated with the patient’s diagnosis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",A,"The correct answer is A. Adenoma.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, which is typically caused by a benign tumor (adenoma) of the parathyroid gland. The elevated calcium and PTH levels, along with the radiographic findings of subperiosteal resorption and osteoporosis, support this diagnosis.",Success
"A 35-year-old woman presents to a psychiatrist for an initial consultation. She reports that for the past 3 years, she has experienced several periods of depressed mood. The episodes do not coincide with any specific life events and seem to resolve after 4-6 weeks. During these episodes, she experiences a depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and a poor appetite, but she at times is able to enjoy spending time with her children and husband but other times she is distressed and cannot enjoy time with them. Upon further questioning, she also reports experiencing occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years. During these episodes, she is very productive at her work as a lawyer and requires less sleep than usual. Her past medical history is notable for obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. She is on insulin and takes methotrexate. She smokes marijuana occasionally. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 124/80 mmHg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, she is quiet with a flattened affect, but is cooperative and answers questions thoroughly. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",C,"The correct answer is C. Cyclothymic disorder.

The patient's symptoms meet the criteria for cyclothymic disorder, which is a mood disorder characterized by periods of depressed mood and periods of elevated mood that are not severe enough to meet the criteria for major depressive episodes or manic episodes. The patient's episodes of depressed mood last for 4-6 weeks, which is consistent with cyclothymic disorder, and she also experiences episodes of elevated mood that increase her productivity and reduce her need for sleep. The patient's ability to experience pleasure during her depressive episodes and her lack of psychotic symptoms also support this diagnosis.

Bipolar I disorder (A) is unlikely because the patient's elevated mood episodes are not severe enough to meet the criteria for manic episodes. Bipolar II disorder (B) is also unlikely because the patient's elevated mood episodes are not severe enough to meet the criteria for hypomanic episodes. Persistent depressive disorder (D) is unlikely because the patient's depressive episodes are not continuous and she experiences periods of elevated mood. Schizoaffective disorder (E) is unlikely because the patient does not exhibit psychotic symptoms.",Success

Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus.

The patient's symptoms, including periodic painful double vision, adduction deficits, and nystagmus, are consistent with a lesion affecting the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), which is a bundle of fibers in the brainstem that coordinates eye movements. The MLF is responsible for adduction (inward movement) of the eye, and damage to this area can cause adduction deficits and nystagmus.

The patient's history of a recent head injury and normal CT scan suggest that the lesion is likely a demyelinating injury, rather than a structural lesion such as a tumor or hematoma. The bilateral disc hyperemia on fundoscopy also supports this diagnosis, as it is a common finding in demyelinating diseases.

""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28

"An 80-year-old African American man is brought to the emergency department in a confused state with history of general illness for the past week. He is known to be hypertensive, but noncompliant with medications for the last 20 years. Physical examination reveals dry skin, ecchymoses, and conjunctival pallor. His blood pressure is 180/99 mm Hg, heart rate is 89/min, and respiratory rate is 17/min. The initial laboratory results are remarkable for hemoglobin of 10 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 90 μm3, platelet count of 200,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen of 29 mg/dL, and creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL. Which of the following would be the best initial management for this patient's condition?",A,"Correct Answer is: C, Calcium channel blocker (CCB)

Explanation: The patient is an 80-year-old African American man with a history of hypertension and noncompliance with medications for 20 years. He presents with confusion, dry skin, ecchymoses, and conjunctival pallor, indicating dehydration and possible end-organ damage. His blood pressure is 180/99 mm Hg, which is severely elevated. The initial laboratory results show anemia, normal platelet count, and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, suggesting kidney damage.

Given the patient's age, race, and comorbidities, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are a good choice for initial management of hypertension. CCBs are effective in reducing blood pressure and have a relatively low risk of adverse effects, particularly in older adults. They are also a good option for African Americans, who tend to respond better to CCBs than to other classes of antihypertensive medications.

ACEIs and ARBs may not be the best initial choice due to the patient's kidney damage and potential risk of worsening renal function. Beta-blockers may not be effective in this patient due to the lack of tachycardia, and thiazide diuretics may exacerbate dehydration.",Success

Sputum culture grows Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A sweat test shows chloride concentration of 85 mEq/L (elevated). Which of the following is involved in the pathogenesis of this patient’s symptoms?",B,"The correct answer is: B. Abnormal CFTR protein

The patient's symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, cough, poor weight gain, and frequent stools with an unpleasant smell, are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). The sweat test result showing an elevated chloride concentration of 85 mEq/L is a diagnostic indicator of CF. The growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum culture is also consistent with CF, as this bacterium is a common pathogen in CF patients.

The abnormal CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein is the underlying cause of CF. The CFTR protein is a chloride channel that regulates the transport of salt and water in and out of cells. In CF, the abnormal CFTR protein leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus that clogs the airways and digestive tract, causing the characteristic symptoms of the disease.",Success

The murmur becomes louder when the patient is asked to squat. An echocardiogram is performed. Which of the structures below gives rise to the defective structure that is causing this patient’s symptoms?",B,"Correct Answer is: C, Infundibular septum

Explanation: The symptoms described, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and a harsh pansystolic murmur, are consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). The fact that the murmur becomes louder when the patient squats suggests that the VSD is a muscular VSD, which is located in the muscular part of the ventricular septum. The infundibular septum is the structure that gives rise to the defective structure causing this patient's symptoms.",Success
"A 26-year-old woman developed rapidly progressive septic shock associated with nuchal rigidity, petechiae, and purpura. She tested positive for both Kernig and Brudzinski's signs and shows signs of confusion, dyspnea, and hypotension. The blood culture results confirmed the presence of Neisseria meningitidis, and a complete blood count (CBC) revealed leukocytosis. Which one of the cytokines below takes part in the pathogenesis of septic shock?",A,"The correct answer is A. Tumor necrosis factor-α.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is a cytokine that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of septic shock. It is released by macrophages and other immune cells in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides, such as those found in Neisseria meningitidis. TNF-α causes a systemic inflammatory response, leading to vasodilation, increased permeability, and activation of other immune cells, which can ultimately lead to septic shock.

The other options are not directly involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock:

B. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is involved in the regulation of eosinophil function and is not typically associated with septic shock.

C. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is involved in the regulation of cell-mediated immunity and is not directly involved in septic shock.

D. Interferon-α (IFN-α) is involved in the regulation of antiviral responses and is not typically associated with septic shock.

Which of the following options best explains the patient’s neurological and psychiatric symptoms?",D,"The correct answer is D. Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids.

The patient's symptoms, including tingling and decreased sensation in both lower extremities, somnolence, and forgetfulness, suggest a neurological disorder. The patient's medical history, including acute hepatitis B 20 years ago, and the presence of a bright red tongue with atrophic papillae, suggest a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient's blood test results, including a low hemoglobin level, low mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and a low reticulocyte count, are consistent with a macrocytic anemia, which is often seen in vitamin B12 deficiency.

Vitamin B12 plays a crucial role in the methylation of myelin phospholipids, which is necessary for the maintenance of the myelin sheath. Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids can lead to demyelination and neurological symptoms, including numbness, tingling, and weakness in the extremities, as well as cognitive impairment and somnolence.",Success

Hepatitis C IgG: Positive
HCV RNA: 100,000,000 IU/ml

This patient should be started on which of the following medications?",A,"The correct answer is A. Sofosbuvir and simeprevir.

The patient's laboratory results indicate that he has chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, as evidenced by the presence of HCV RNA in his blood. The patient's history of intravenous drug use and homelessness in his early 30s suggests that he may have acquired the infection through shared needles or other high-risk behaviors.

Sofosbuvir and simeprevir are direct-acting antiviral agents that are commonly used to treat HCV genotype 1 infection, which is the most common genotype in the United States. This combination therapy has been shown to be highly effective in achieving sustained virologic response (SVR) in patients with chronic HCV infection.

Interferon-alpha (option B) is an older treatment for HCV that is no longer commonly used due to its side effects and lower efficacy compared to direct-acting antiviral agents. Interferon-gamma (option C) is not a treatment for HCV. Ribavirin (option D) is a medication that is sometimes used in combination with interferon-alpha or direct-acting antiviral agents to treat HCV, but it is not typically used as monotherapy. Lamivudine (option E) is an antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV infection, not HCV.",Success

She appears ill and is lethargic. Her temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Physical examination shows jaundice and tender hepatomegaly. Laboratory studies show the presence of anti-hepatitis A IgM antibodies. A liver biopsy performed at this time would most likely show which of the following histopathological findings?",A,"The correct answer is B. Acellular debris surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages.

This question is describing a patient with acute hepatitis A, which is a viral infection that causes inflammation of the liver. The symptoms and laboratory results, including the presence of anti-hepatitis A IgM antibodies, are consistent with this diagnosis.

On liver biopsy, acute hepatitis A would typically show a pattern of inflammation and necrosis, characterized by the presence of acellular debris (dead liver cells) surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages, which are immune cells that are trying to clean up the damaged tissue. This is the most likely histopathological finding in this scenario.",Success

"A 9-month-old boy is brought to his pediatrician by his mother for a routine health checkup. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. He was breastfed for the first 3 months and then switched to cow’s milk and about two months ago she started giving him fruits and vegetables. Family history is noncontributory. Today, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, and temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F). On examination, he has a heartbeat with a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Generally, the boy looks pale. His weight and height fall within the expected range. A complete blood count (CBC) shows the following:
Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.1 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): 65 fL
Total iron binding capacity (TIBC): 550 μg/dL
Serum iron: 45 µg/dL
Serum lead: < 5 µg/dL
What is the best treatment for this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Proper diet and iron supplementation.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest iron deficiency anemia. The hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL is below normal, and the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 65 fL indicates microcytic anemia, which is consistent with iron deficiency. The total iron binding capacity (TIBC) is elevated, and the serum iron level is low, further supporting the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia.

The best treatment for this patient is to provide iron supplementation in addition to ensuring a proper diet that is rich in iron. Iron supplementation will help to replenish the patient's iron stores and correct the anemia. A proper diet that includes iron-rich foods such as meat, poultry, fish, and fortified cereals will also help to maintain adequate iron levels.

Option A, iron supplementation only, is not sufficient as the patient also needs a proper diet to maintain adequate iron levels. Option C, multivitamins, may not provide sufficient iron to correct the anemia. Option D, proper diet only, may not be enough to correct the anemia quickly, and iron supplementation is necessary to replenish the patient's iron stores. Option E, lead chelation therapy, is not indicated as the serum lead level is within normal limits.",Success

"A 58-year-old male is diagnosed with hypertension and started on daily propranolol after failing antihypertensive therapy with other medications. Three months later, his blood pressure appears to be adequately controlled on this therapy. While working in his garden one afternoon, the patient is stung by a wasp and experiences a severe anaphylactic reaction that is subsequently treated with epinephrine. Which of the following effects would be expected upon administration of this epinephrine treatment?",C,"The correct answer is A. Decreased bronchodilation.

Propranolol is a non-selective beta blocker, which means it blocks both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. Beta-2 receptors are responsible for bronchodilation, which is the widening of the airways. In an anaphylactic reaction, epinephrine is administered to stimulate beta-2 receptors and cause bronchodilation, which helps to relieve respiratory distress.

However, in this patient, the beta blocker propranolol is already blocking beta-2 receptors, which would reduce the effectiveness of epinephrine in causing bronchodilation. Therefore, the administration of epinephrine would be expected to result in decreased bronchodilation.",Success

CT-guided drainage of the fluid collection yields 250 mL of yellow-greenish fluid. Release of which of the following substances is most likely responsible for the formation of the drained lesion?",E,"The correct answer is C, Lipoteichoic acid.

The patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are consistent with diverticulitis, a complication of diverticulosis. The formation of the abscess (the 5.0-cm, low-attenuation pelvic lesion with air-fluid levels) is likely due to the release of lipoteichoic acid, a component of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria, which is a common cause of diverticulitis. Lipoteichoic acid is a potent inducer of inflammation and can lead to the formation of abscesses.",Success

"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
Given the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?",B,"Correct Answer is: B. A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.

Explanation: A type 1 error, also known as a false positive, occurs when a study finds a statistically significant difference between groups when, in reality, there is no true difference. This means that the null hypothesis (which states that there is no difference between groups) is actually true, but the study incorrectly rejects it. In the context of this study, if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error, it would mean that mepolizumab does not actually reduce asthma exacerbations or improve markers of asthma control, but the study incorrectly concluded that it does.",Success
"A 30-year-old Japanese woman is brought to the emergency department after fainting at work. She says she was only unconscious for a moment and recovered quickly. She reports increasing fatigue and joint pain for the past 4 months. Her blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, and her temperature is 36.6°C (98.0°F).

A 21-year-old female presents to the clinic requesting prenatal counseling. She was born with a disease that has led her to have recurrent upper respiratory infections throughout her life requiring antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. She marries a man (without this disease phenotype) from a population where the prevalence of this disease is 1/100. What is the chance that their child will have the disease of interest?,A,"The correct answer is B. 1/10.

The disease described is cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive disorder. The patient is homozygous for the disease-causing mutation (affected). Her husband is not affected, so he is either homozygous for the normal allele or heterozygous (carrier). Since the prevalence of the disease in his population is 1/100, the frequency of the disease-causing allele is approximately 1/10 (square root of 1/100). Therefore, the probability that he is a carrier is 2/10 (2 times the frequency of the disease-causing allele).

The patient's genotype is aa (homozygous affected), and her husband's genotype is either AA (homozygous normal) or Aa (heterozygous carrier). The possible genotypes of their offspring are:

* If the husband is AA: all offspring will be Aa (heterozygous carriers)
* If the husband is Aa: offspring will have a 1/2 chance of being Aa (heterozygous carriers) and a 1/2 chance of being aa (homozygous affected)

During the first 2 days of clinical manifestations, the parents of the child tried to control the symptoms using acetaminophen; however, the newborn continued to be ill, and blisters were noticeable around the buttocks, hands, and feet. During the physical examination, the vital signs include body temperature 39.0°C (102.3°F), heart rate 130/min, and respiratory rate 45/min. Ears, nose, and oral mucosa preserved their integrity, while the skin presents with diffuse blanching erythema and flaccid blisters with a positive Nikolsky’s sign. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",B,"The correct answer is B. Scalded skin syndrome.

Scalded skin syndrome, also known as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, is a rare but serious skin infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus. It typically affects newborns and young children, and is characterized by fever, irritability, and a distinctive skin rash with blisters and erosions. The Nikolsky's sign, which is a positive sign in this case, is a characteristic feature of scalded skin syndrome, where gentle pressure on the skin causes the top layer of skin to separate from the underlying layers, leading to blistering and erosion.

The other options are not as likely:

A. Scarlet fever is a bacterial infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, which typically presents with a characteristic sandpaper-like rash, fever, and sore throat. While it can cause skin lesions, it is not typically associated with blisters and erosions.

C. Impetigo is a bacterial skin infection that can cause blisters and crusts, but it is typically more localized and does not have the same widespread, diffuse erythema and blisters seen in scalded skin syndrome.

D. Erysipela is a bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissues, typically caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. While it can cause skin lesions and fever, it is not typically associated with blisters and erosions.

When you shine a light in her left eye there is no response. What response would you expect when you shine a light in her right eye?",B,"The correct answer is A. Bilateral mydriasis.

When light is shone into the right eye, the normal pupillary light reflex would cause both pupils to constrict (miosis). However, since the left eye is affected and has no response to light, shining light into the right eye would cause the right pupil to dilate (mydriasis) due to the lack of input from the affected left eye. This would result in bilateral mydriasis.",Success
