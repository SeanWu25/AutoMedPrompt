## Answer
Hyponatremia, or low sodium levels in the blood, can occur in individuals involved in heavy exercise due to excessive fluid intake without adequate replacement of sodium. This is often seen in endurance athletes who drink large amounts of water, diluting the sodium in their body. 

Option A, urine sodium plus urine potassium equal to 36 mEq/L, does not directly indicate hyponatremia. This is a measure of the concentration of these electrolytes in the urine, not the blood. 

Option B, urine osmolality of 200 mOsm/kg after exercise, is a measure of the concentration of solutes in the urine. A low urine osmolality could indicate dilution from excessive water intake, but it does not necessarily mean that the individual is hyponatremic.

Option D, an increase in urinary osmolality during exercise, could indicate dehydration, not hyponatremia. During dehydration, the body conserves water by concentrating the urine, leading to an increase in osmolality.

Option C, weight gain of .3 kg after exercise, is the most likely to be associated with the development of hyponatremia. This is because weight gain after exercise is often due to excessive fluid intake. If this fluid is mostly water without adequate sodium, it can dilute the sodium in the body, leading to hyponatremia.

Therefore, the answer is C. Weight gain .3 kg after exercise.
