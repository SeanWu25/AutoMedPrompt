## Answer
The patient's symptoms of polydipsia, polyuria, nephrocalcinosis, hypomagnesemia, hypercalciuria, and hypocitraturia, along with the ocular abnormalities (myopia magna and macular coloboma), suggest a diagnosis of familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC). This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects the kidneys' ability to reabsorb magnesium and calcium, leading to excessive urinary excretion of these minerals. The condition is associated with mutations in the CLDN16 and CLDN19 genes. However, the presence of ocular abnormalities in this patient, specifically myopia magna and macular coloboma, points towards a mutation in the CLDN19 gene. Mutations in the CLDN19 gene are known to cause FHHNC with ocular involvement, while mutations in the CLDN16 gene cause FHHNC without ocular involvement. The calcium-sensing receptor gene mutations are associated with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and not with the symptoms presented by the patient. Therefore, the answer is C. A loss of function mutation in the CLDN19 gene.
