## Answer
Icodextrin is a glucose polymer solution used in peritoneal dialysis (PD) for long dwell times. It is absorbed more slowly than glucose, providing sustained ultrafiltration over a longer period. This makes it particularly useful for patients with high transport characteristics, where glucose solutions may be absorbed before adequate ultrafiltration has occurred. Therefore, it can help in improving fluid balance in PD patients. However, there is no evidence to suggest that icodextrin leads to a faster resolution of peritonitis, decreases sodium sieving, or is associated with increased mortality. Therefore, the answer is [B. It results in improved ï¬‚uid balance].
