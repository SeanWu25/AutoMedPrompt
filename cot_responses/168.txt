## Answer
The patient in the scenario has chronic kidney disease (CKD) secondary to diabetic nephropathy. The goal of treatment in such patients is to slow the progression of CKD and reduce cardiovascular risk. This is achieved by controlling blood pressure, managing hyperglycemia, and using medications that have a specific renoprotective effect.

Option A, Losartan, is an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). ARBs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) like Lisinopril, which the patient is already taking, have similar effects on delaying the progression of CKD. Therefore, adding Losartan would not provide additional benefit.

Option B, Atrasentan, is an endothelin receptor antagonist. While it has shown some promise in reducing proteinuria in diabetic nephropathy, its role in delaying the progression of CKD is not as well established as other options.

Option D, Liraglutide, is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. It is primarily used for managing hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes. While it may have some beneficial effects on the kidneys, its primary role is not to delay the progression of CKD.

Option C, an SGLT-2 inhibitor, is a class of medications that has been shown to have significant renoprotective effects in patients with type 2 diabetes, even those with normal kidney function. They work by blocking the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, leading to increased glucose excretion and lower blood glucose levels. In addition to their glucose-lowering effect, SGLT-2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce albuminuria and slow the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), both of which are beneficial in slowing the progression of CKD.

Therefore, the answer is [C. An SGLT-2 inhibitor].
