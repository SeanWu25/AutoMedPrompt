## Answer
The question describes a situation where a hemodialysis facility has been cited for repeated violations in infection control, including cross-contamination of medical supplies and improper disinfection of treatment surfaces. The facility has been previously cited for poor infection control, and interviews with staff suggest a lack of individual accountability and a tendency to blame others for problems. 

Option A, outdated infection control policies, could be a potential issue, but the question does not provide information that the policies are outdated. 

Option B, inadequate staffing, is not mentioned in the scenario. 

Option C, poor patient and staff understanding of hand hygiene, could be a contributing factor to the infection control issues, but the scenario does not specifically mention hand hygiene as a problem. 

Option D, high community incidence of healthcare-acquired infections, is not mentioned in the scenario. 

Option E, lack of an effective culture of safety, seems to be the most fitting issue. The scenario describes a lack of individual accountability and a tendency to blame others for problems, which suggests a poor culture of safety. An effective culture of safety would involve individual accountability, a focus on learning from mistakes, and a commitment to improving patient safety.

Therefore, the answer is E. Lack of an effective culture of safety.
