## Answer
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is known to be teratogenic and is associated with a high risk of miscarriage and congenital malformations. Therefore, it is recommended to discontinue MMF prior to conception. Azathioprine is a safer alternative to MMF during pregnancy and is often used as a substitute. The transition should occur at least 6 weeks prior to conception to allow MMF to be completely eliminated from the body. Tacrolimus, on the other hand, is generally considered safe during pregnancy and is often continued, although levels may need to be adjusted as pregnancy progresses due to changes in drug metabolism and clearance. Waiting until the first trimester to discontinue MMF (option B) is not advisable due to the risk of fetal exposure during early development. Transitioning MMF to sirolimus (option C) is also not recommended as sirolimus has similar risks to MMF and is not considered safe during pregnancy. Discontinuing tacrolimus after pregnancy is confirmed (option D) is not necessary as tacrolimus is generally considered safe during pregnancy. Therefore, the answer is [A. Transition MMF to azathioprine > 6 weeks prior to attempts to conceive and plan to increase tacrolimus about 20%â€“25% during the second trimester to maintain therapeutic levels].
