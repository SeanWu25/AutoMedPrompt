## Answer
The patient's clinical presentation and family history suggest a genetic cause for his kidney disease. The presence of FSGS (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis) on light microscopy and thinning of the GBM (glomerular basement membrane) with focal regions of podocyte foot process effacement on electron microscopy are key findings. 

Option A, NPHS1 (nephrin), is associated with congenital nephrotic syndrome, which typically presents in infancy with massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. This does not match the patient's presentation.

Option B, ACTN4 (alpha-actinin 4), is associated with autosomal dominant FSGS. However, this typically presents with proteinuria in adolescence or early adulthood and progresses to end-stage renal disease within 10-20 years. The patient's age and the presence of hematuria make this less likely.

Option C, COL4 (type IV chain of collagen), is associated with Alport syndrome and thin basement membrane nephropathy. Alport syndrome typically presents with hematuria, sensorineural deafness, and ocular abnormalities, none of which are present in this patient. Thin basement membrane nephropathy typically presents with isolated microscopic hematuria, which is also not consistent with this patient's presentation.

Option D, NPHS2 (podocin), is associated with autosomal recessive FSGS. This typically presents in childhood with proteinuria, but can also present in adulthood. The presence of FSGS on biopsy and the family history of kidney disease make this the most likely option.

Therefore, the answer is [D. NPHS2 (podocin)].
