## Answer
The patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is interested in dietary modifications to reduce the risk of CKD progression. The options provided are related to her beverage consumption. 

Option A suggests discontinuing caffeinated beverages. While excessive caffeine intake can potentially increase blood pressure and have a diuretic effect, moderate consumption is generally considered safe and is not directly linked to CKD progression.

Option B suggests discontinuing milk-containing beverages. While milk does contain phosphorus, which can be problematic in later stages of CKD, the patient is currently in stage G3a:A1, which is not the most severe stage. Therefore, it is not necessary for her to completely avoid milk at this stage.

Option C suggests consuming .2 liters of water per day. This is a very low amount of water intake and is generally not recommended. Adequate hydration is important for kidney health.

Option D suggests discontinuing beverages containing artificial sweeteners. There is some evidence that suggests a link between artificial sweeteners and kidney damage. Diet sodas, which the patient consumes several of per day, often contain these artificial sweeteners. 

Therefore, the answer is D. Discontinuation of beverages containing artificial sweeteners.
