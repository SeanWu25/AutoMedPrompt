## Answer
Pediculosis capitis, also known as head lice, is a common condition that primarily affects children. It is highly contagious and spreads through direct contact with the hair of an infested person. However, it is important to note that lice cannot survive for long away from the human scalp and they do not infest environments or objects such as dialysis equipment or chairs. Therefore, examining all patients in the facility for head lice (option B) is not necessary. 

Daily hair washing with a shampoo/conditioner or conditioner before and after application of a topical pediculicide (option C) is also not recommended. Over-washing can lead to dryness and irritation of the scalp, and it may also reduce the effectiveness of the pediculicide.

Lindane shampoo (option D) is not recommended for the treatment of head lice, especially in children. Lindane is a neurotoxic pesticide that can cause serious side effects, including seizures and death. It is only used as a last resort when other treatments have failed and should never be used in children, pregnant women, the elderly, or individuals with skin conditions or a low body weight.

The most appropriate management, in this case, would be to use extra care in the terminal cleaning of the dialysis station, with special attention to the dialysis chair after the patient has completed the dialysis treatment (option A). Although lice cannot survive for long away from the human scalp, they can temporarily survive on objects such as clothing, hats, and furniture. Therefore, thorough cleaning of the dialysis station and chair can help to prevent the spread of lice to other patients.

Therefore, the answer is [A].
