The question is asking for the preferred order of use for maintenance drugs in a patient with proteinase-3-ANCA–associated vasculitis who has achieved remission after treatment with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. 

Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD20, a protein expressed on the surface of B cells. It is used in the treatment of several autoimmune diseases and malignancies. Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive medication used to prevent the body from rejecting a transplanted organ, as well as to treat autoimmune diseases. Mycophenolate is another immunosuppressive drug used to prevent rejection in organ transplantation. Extended cyclophosphamide refers to a longer duration of treatment with cyclophosphamide, a chemotherapy drug that is also used to suppress the immune system in certain autoimmune diseases.

The preferred order of use for these drugs would be based on their efficacy and safety profile in the treatment of proteinase-3-ANCA–associated vasculitis. 

Rituximab has been shown to be effective as a maintenance therapy in ANCA-associated vasculitis and is generally well-tolerated. Azathioprine is also commonly used as a maintenance therapy in this condition, although it may be less effective than rituximab. Mycophenolate and extended cyclophosphamide are less commonly used due to concerns about side effects and toxicity.

Therefore, the preferred order of use would be rituximab, followed by azathioprine, then mycophenolate, and finally extended cyclophosphamide.

Therefore, the answer is [A. Rituximab > azathioprine > mycophenolate > extended cyclophosphamide].
