## Answer
Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), also known as calciphylaxis, is a rare and serious disorder that presents with skin ischemia and necrosis. It is most commonly seen in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The pathogenesis of CUA is complex and not fully understood, but it is thought to involve a combination of systemic inflammation, abnormalities in calcium and phosphate metabolism, and the use of certain medications. 

Among the options provided, the use of activated vitamin D (Option C) is the most likely to be associated with an increased risk of CUA. Activated vitamin D is often used in patients with ESRD to manage secondary hyperparathyroidism. However, it can also lead to hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, which can contribute to vascular calcification and increase the risk of CUA. 

Hypertension (Option A) is a common comorbidity in patients with ESRD, but it is not specifically associated with an increased risk of CUA. Ethnicity (Option B) is also not a known risk factor for CUA. The use of insulin (Option D) is not associated with an increased risk of CUA.

Therefore, the answer is [C. Her use of activated vitamin D].
