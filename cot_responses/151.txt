## Answer
The key to improving adherence to hand hygiene practices is to make it as easy and convenient as possible for staff to clean their hands, while also providing feedback on their performance. Option A, encouraging staff to wash their hands with soap and water before and after each patient contact, is a good practice but it may not be practical in a busy dialysis center where staff may not have the time to leave their station to wash their hands. Option B, promoting the frequent use of gloves, is not a good strategy because gloves are not a substitute for hand hygiene and can still spread germs if not changed frequently. Option D, minimizing the time needed for hand hygiene by training staff to apply a small amount of an alcohol-based hand rub for 10 seconds, is not recommended because it may not be sufficient to kill all germs. Therefore, the best strategy is option C, making alcohol-based hand rub readily available near dialysis stations, and observing hand hygiene opportunities monthly, providing staff with feedback regarding their performance. This strategy makes it easy for staff to clean their hands, and the feedback component helps to reinforce good practices and correct poor ones.

Therefore, the answer is [C].
