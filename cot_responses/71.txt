## Answer
The question is asking whether a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus, stage G3b CKD due to diabetic kidney disease, and asymptomatic hyperuricemia should start urate-lowering therapy. 

Option A suggests that urate-lowering therapy only slows GFR decline when started in individuals with an eGFR > 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2. However, the patient's eGFR is 36 ml/min per 1.73 m2, which is less than the threshold mentioned in this option. Therefore, this option is not applicable to this patient.

Option B suggests starting febuxostat, a urate-lowering therapy, because it has been shown to delay progression to ESRD. However, the question does not provide any evidence or studies that support the use of febuxostat in delaying progression to ESRD in patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia and CKD. Therefore, this option is not supported by the information provided in the question.

Option D suggests that urate-lowering therapy is only effective in individuals who have both CKD and gout. However, the patient does not have gout, so this option is not applicable to this patient.

Option C suggests that the patient should not start urate-lowering therapy because existing evidence does not support efficacy in delaying the need for renal replacement therapy. This option aligns with the current guidelines and evidence, which do not recommend urate-lowering therapy for asymptomatic hyperuricemia, even in patients with CKD.

Therefore, the answer is [C. He should not start urate-lowering therapy, because existing evidence does not support efÔ¨Åcacy in delaying the need for renal replacement therapy].
