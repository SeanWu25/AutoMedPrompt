## Answer
Oral adsorbents are used to reduce the levels of uremic toxins in the body. However, the existing evidence regarding their effectiveness in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is not very strong. While some studies suggest that oral adsorbents may reduce serum indoxyl sulfate levels, the overall evidence does not conclusively show that they delay the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Poor adherence could potentially limit the use of oral adsorbents, but this is not the primary issue at hand. The main point is that the existing studies do not show a significant benefit of using oral adsorbents for reducing uremic toxin levels and slowing CKD progression. Therefore, the answer is B. Existing studies show no benefit.
