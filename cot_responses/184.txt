## Answer
When considering a secondary component in blood pressure elevation, it's important to consider factors that could directly influence blood pressure. These could include lifestyle factors, diet, and especially medication use. 

Option A, asking about the number of steps walked daily, could provide information about the patient's physical activity level. However, while physical activity can influence blood pressure, it's not typically a direct cause of secondary hypertension.

Option B, asking about the number of meals eaten at home, could provide information about the patient's diet. A diet high in sodium, for example, can contribute to hypertension. However, this question is not specific enough to identify dietary factors that could cause secondary hypertension.

Option D, asking about recent travel to a third-world country, could potentially identify exposure to infectious diseases that could cause secondary hypertension. However, this is a less common cause of hypertension and would not be the most likely cause in this case.

Option C, asking about medication and drug use, is the most likely to identify a direct cause of secondary hypertension. Many medications and drugs, both prescription and over-the-counter, can cause or contribute to hypertension. This includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), certain antidepressants, decongestants, and illicit drugs like cocaine and methamphetamines.

Therefore, the answer is [C. What medications or drugs, prescription or otherwise, are you using?]
