## Answer
The question is asking for the characteristic that is most predictive of multiple readmissions in patients receiving hemodialysis (HD). 

Option A suggests that age > 65 years is the most predictive factor. While it is true that older age can be associated with more health complications, it is not necessarily the most predictive factor for multiple readmissions.

Option B suggests that community dwelling is the most predictive factor. However, whether a patient lives in a community setting or not does not directly correlate with their likelihood of readmission.

Option D suggests that a recent admission for a noncardiac cause is the most predictive factor. While the cause of a recent admission might influence the likelihood of readmission, it is not necessarily the most predictive factor.

Option C suggests that the number of hospitalizations in the past year is the most predictive factor. This option seems the most plausible because a history of multiple hospitalizations indicates a pattern of health instability, which could lead to more readmissions. 

Therefore, the answer is [C. Number of hospitalizations in the past year].
