## Answer
The patient's presentation includes a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, scattered hazy opacities on chest x-ray, and urine abnormalities including proteinuria and hematuria. However, she has no respiratory or urinary symptoms, and her serum creatinine is normal, indicating that her kidney function is not significantly impaired. 

Option A suggests that urine abnormalities are uncommon in COVID-19 patients without acute kidney injury (AKI) and are highly predictive of glomerulonephritis. However, this is not entirely accurate. While urine abnormalities can occur in COVID-19 patients, they are not necessarily predictive of glomerulonephritis, especially in the absence of other symptoms or signs of this condition.

Option B suggests that nephrotic-range proteinuria can be secondary to COVID-19 in patients who have high-risk APOL-1 alleles. While APOL-1 risk alleles are associated with a higher risk of kidney disease in certain populations, there is no specific evidence linking them to nephrotic-range proteinuria in COVID-19 patients.

Option C suggests that COVID-19 patients have a higher risk of glomerulonephritis, including IgA nephritis and anti-GBM nephritis. While COVID-19 can affect the kidneys, there is no specific evidence suggesting a higher risk of these particular forms of glomerulonephritis in COVID-19 patients.

Option D suggests that diffuse microangiopathy is a frequent finding in autopsy and biopsy reports from COVID-19 patients. This is accurate. COVID-19 can cause endothelial injury and inflammation, leading to microangiopathy. This can manifest as proteinuria and hematuria, as seen in this patient.

Therefore, the answer is [D. Diffuse microangiopathy is a frequent Ô¨Ånding in autopsy and biopsy reports from COVID-19 patients].
