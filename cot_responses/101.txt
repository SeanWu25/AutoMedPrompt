## Answer
The patient's EKG findings of shortened QT intervals and ST segment/T wave abnormalities, along with his symptoms of intermittent substernal chest pain and resting tachycardia, suggest a cardiac etiology. However, his normal troponin levels make acute coronary syndrome less likely. The shortened QT interval can be caused by hypercalcemia or hypermagnesemia. Given that the patient has been bedridden for a prolonged period with likely inadequate dietary intake, hypercalcemia secondary to immobilization is a possibility. Immobilization can lead to increased bone resorption and subsequent hypercalcemia. Therefore, checking serum calcium levels would be a reasonable next step in this patient's evaluation. Cardiac catheterization, chest CT, and cardiac ultrasonography are more invasive or resource-intensive tests that may not be necessary at this stage. Serum magnesium could also be checked, but hypermagnesemia is less likely in this clinical scenario.
Therefore, the answer is C. Serum calcium.
