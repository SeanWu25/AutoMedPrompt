## Answer
The question is asking about the risks associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) and treatment with warfarin. 

Option A states that AF is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke. This is true. AF can cause blood to pool in the atria, leading to the formation of blood clots. If a clot travels to the brain, it can block blood flow, causing an ischemic stroke. 

Option B suggests that AF is associated with increased mortality only in the first 90 days after diagnosis. This is not accurate. AF is associated with increased mortality risk, but this risk is not limited to the first 90 days after diagnosis. 

Option C suggests that asymptomatic supraventricular rhythms are not associated with increased mortality risk. This is not relevant to the question, as the patient has been diagnosed with AF, not an asymptomatic supraventricular rhythm.

Option D states that warfarin use in hemodialysis (HD) patients does not increase the risk of bleeding. This is incorrect. Warfarin is an anticoagulant, and its use is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, including in patients on HD.

Therefore, the answer is [A. AF is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke].
