## Answer
The patient in the scenario has anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease (CKD) following bilateral nephrectomy. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) like erythropoietin are typically used to treat anemia in CKD, but this patient has opted not to use them due to a recent cancer diagnosis. 

Option A is incorrect because while ESAs do not cause de novo malignancy, they can potentially stimulate the growth of existing cancer cells. 

Option B is incorrect because iron sucrose is used to treat iron deficiency in CKD patients, and there is no evidence that it increases the risk of infectious complications at the prescribed dose.

Option C is incorrect because cinacalcet is used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients, but it does not directly improve hemoglobin levels.

Option E is incorrect because competitive prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitors, such as roxadustat, have been shown to be effective in treating anemia in CKD patients, including those who have undergone nephrectomy.

This leaves us with option D. Roxadustat is a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor that stimulates erythropoiesis and regulates iron metabolism. It has been shown to be effective in treating anemia in CKD patients and could be a future alternative for this patient who does not want to use ESAs.

Therefore, the answer is [D. Roxadustat is a possible future alternative agent for the treatment of his anemia]
