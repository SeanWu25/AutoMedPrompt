## Answer
The patient has Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (GN), which is a common extrahepatic manifestation of HCV. The first line of treatment for HCV-associated GN is to cure the HCV infection. Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents are the treatment of choice for HCV infection. Pangenotypic DAA regimens, such as sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, can be used in all HCV genotypes and are recommended in patients with kidney disease, including those with severe kidney impairment or end-stage kidney disease. The use of rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against CD20, is not recommended as initial therapy for HCV-associated GN. It may be considered in patients who do not respond to antiviral therapy or who have contraindications to antiviral therapy. Therefore, the answer is E. She should be treated with a pangenotypic DAA, and rituximab should not be used, at least initially.
