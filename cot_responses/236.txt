## Answer
The question is asking for an evidence-based approach to manage hyperkalemia in a patient with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) who is already on dialysis. 

Option A suggests that sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is not effective in dialysis patients. However, this is not accurate. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is a medication that can help lower potassium levels in the blood and it can be used in patients on dialysis.

Option B suggests choosing sodium zirconium cyclosilicate over patiromer because it is less likely to cause edema. While it's true that sodium zirconium cyclosilicate is less likely to cause edema compared to patiromer, this option does not directly address the patient's hyperkalemia.

Option C suggests that sodium zirconium cyclosilicate also removes hydrogen ions and may increase serum bicarbonate. This is true, but it does not directly address the patient's hyperkalemia.

Option D suggests that sodium zirconium cyclosilicate works quickly and has been shown to provide added benefit to insulin and glucose in the treatment of acute severe hyperkalemia. This is accurate and directly addresses the patient's hyperkalemia. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate can be used in conjunction with insulin and glucose to quickly lower potassium levels in the blood.

Therefore, the answer is [D. Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate works quickly and has been shown to provide added beneÔ¨Åt to insulin and glucose in the treatment of acute severe hyperkalemia].
