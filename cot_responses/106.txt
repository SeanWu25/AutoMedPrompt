## Answer
The patient's kidney biopsy shows a membranoproliferative pattern with strong linear GBM IgG staining by immunofluorescence. The IgG was lambda-light chain restricted, which suggests that the IgG in the kidney biopsy may be monoclonal. Monoclonal IgG is produced by a single clone of plasma cells and is typically associated with conditions such as multiple myeloma. The absence of circulating anti-GBM antibodies makes option D less likely, as this treatment regimen is typically used for anti-GBM disease. The presence of ANCA is not mentioned in the patient's history or lab results, making option B less likely. The progression of the patient's disease to requiring dialysis within 1 year (option C) cannot be definitively determined based on the information provided. Therefore, the answer is A. The IgG in the kidney biopsy may be monoclonal.
