## Answer
To answer this question, we need to understand the relationship between diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (CKD). 

Option A suggests that approximately half of all CKD cases are attributed to diabetes. This is plausible as diabetes is a leading cause of CKD, but the exact proportion may vary.

Option B suggests that reducing diabetes would not lower the CKD burden. This is unlikely to be correct, as diabetes is a major risk factor for CKD. Therefore, reducing the prevalence of diabetes would likely reduce the incidence of CKD.

Option C suggests that the prevalence of CKD is twice as high in adults with diabetes than in those without. This is also plausible, given the strong link between diabetes and CKD.

Option D suggests that more timely and effective implementation of CKD care reduces adverse kidney disease outcomes in adults with diabetes. This is likely to be true, as early detection and management of CKD can slow its progression and reduce complications.

However, the question asks for the statement that is correct regarding the public health impact of diabetes mellitus in the United States. While all options discuss the relationship between diabetes and CKD, option A provides a specific statistic that can be verified. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, diabetes does indeed cause approximately 44% of all new cases of kidney failure, which is close to one out of two.

Therefore, the answer is [A].
