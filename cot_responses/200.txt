## Answer
First, let's understand the disease in question. C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is a rare kidney disease characterized by deposition of complement C3 in the glomeruli, leading to glomerular inflammation and damage. It includes dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN). The disease is driven by dysregulation of the alternative pathway of complement activation.

Option A suggests that eculizumab, a complement inhibitor, has shown benefit in the majority of patients with C3G. However, eculizumab, which inhibits the terminal complement pathway, has shown variable results in C3G, which is primarily driven by dysregulation at the level of C3 convertase, upstream of the terminal pathway. Therefore, this statement is not entirely accurate.

Option B suggests that treatment with mycophenolate mofetil and steroids has been associated with improved rates of remission of C3G in observational studies. While these agents are often used in the treatment of C3G, their efficacy is not well established due to the rarity of the disease and lack of randomized controlled trials. Therefore, this statement is not entirely accurate either.

Option C suggests that in patients with monoclonal gammopathyâ€“associated C3 glomerulopathy, treatment with immunosuppression shows similar outcomes to clone-based therapy. However, clone-directed therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplant) is preferred over immunosuppression in these patients as it targets the underlying cause of the disease. Therefore, this statement is not accurate.

Option D suggests that use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be associated with reduced levels of complement activation in C3G by blocking cleavage of C3. However, ACE inhibitors like lisinopril are used in C3G primarily for their antiproteinuric effects, not for their impact on complement activation. Therefore, this statement is not accurate.

Therefore, the answer is [None of the above].
