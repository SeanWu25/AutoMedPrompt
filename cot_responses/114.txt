## Answer
The prognosis of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (GN) depends on several factors. The patient's serum creatinine level at presentation is one of the most important predictors of prognosis. A higher serum creatinine level at presentation is associated with a higher risk of dialysis dependency at 1 year. This is because a higher creatinine level indicates more severe kidney damage. The patient's age is not typically associated with a reduced hazard of dialysis dependency. In fact, older age is usually associated with a worse prognosis in kidney disease. The percentage of crescents shown by examination of a kidney biopsy specimen can be predictive of the severity of the disease, but it is not typically used as a standalone predictor of dialysis dependency at 1 year. Recent studies have shown improved survival rates in anti-GBM nephritis, but the exact percentage can vary widely depending on the specifics of the patient population and treatment regimen. Therefore, the answer is A. His serum creatinine level at presentation is an independent predictor of dialysis dependency at 1 year.
