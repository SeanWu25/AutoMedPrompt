## Answer
The patient's EPTS score is 93, which is quite high. The EPTS score is used to predict post-transplant survival based on factors such as age, time on dialysis, and presence of diabetes or prior solid organ transplant. A higher score indicates a lower expected post-transplant survival. The KDPI score, on the other hand, is a measure of the quality of the donor kidney, with higher scores indicating poorer quality. 

Option A suggests not consenting for KDPI >85 kidneys due to the increased risk associated with high KDPI kidneys transplanted to individuals with high EPTS scores. This is a valid concern as both high EPTS and high KDPI are associated with poorer outcomes. However, this does not take into account the potential benefit of transplantation over remaining on dialysis.

Option B suggests not placing the patient on the waiting list because he is not expected to have a survival benefit from transplantation. However, the patient has been approved for kidney transplantation and is already on the active waitlist. This suggests that the medical team has determined that he is likely to benefit from transplantation.

Option D suggests considering only KDPI >85 kidneys, given his high EPTS. This would limit the patient's options and potentially increase his wait time for a transplant.

Option C suggests encouraging the patient to consent for KDPI >85 kidneys because of the increased survival associated with high KDPI kidneys compared with remaining on the waitlist for a KDPI 35-85 kidney. This seems to be the most reasonable option. While high KDPI kidneys are of poorer quality, receiving a transplant sooner rather than later may still provide a survival benefit over remaining on dialysis.

Therefore, the answer is [C].
