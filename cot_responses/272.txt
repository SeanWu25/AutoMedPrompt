## Answer
The question is asking about factors that have been shown to be associated with nonadherence to treatment after transplantation. Nonadherence to treatment can lead to poor outcomes after transplantation, including graft rejection and loss. 

Option A refers to the patient's habit of cutting short her dialysis treatments due to scheduling conflicts. This could indicate a lack of commitment to her treatment regimen, which could potentially carry over into nonadherence after transplantation. 

Option B refers to the patient's poorly controlled hypertension. While poorly controlled hypertension can lead to complications after transplantation, it is not directly associated with nonadherence to treatment.

Option C refers to the patient's poorly controlled hyperphosphatemia on dialysis. Like hypertension, while this can lead to complications, it is not directly associated with nonadherence.

Option D refers to the patient's hyperkalemia. Again, while this can lead to complications, it is not directly associated with nonadherence.

Option E refers to the patient's lack of confirmed post-transplantation caregivers. Inadequate social support has been shown in studies to be associated with nonadherence after transplantation. Patients who lack a strong support system may have difficulty managing their medications and attending follow-up appointments, which can lead to nonadherence.

Therefore, the answer is [E. Inadequate social support].
