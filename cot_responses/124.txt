## Answer
To answer this question, we need to consider which of the given options would most likely lead to better outcomes in peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis. 

Option A suggests that centers with fewer PD patients per year would have better outcomes. However, this is not necessarily true. The number of patients a center treats does not directly correlate with the quality of care provided. 

Option B suggests that less training time leads to better outcomes. This is counterintuitive as more training time would generally lead to better patient understanding and management of their condition, thus potentially leading to better outcomes.

Option C suggests that centers with a higher percentage of patients treated with PD would have better outcomes. This could be true as these centers might have more experience and expertise in managing PD and its complications, including peritonitis. 

Option D suggests that training patients soon after catheter insertion would lead to better outcomes. While early training is important, it does not necessarily guarantee better outcomes as the quality and comprehensiveness of the training are also crucial.

Therefore, considering all these factors, the center characteristic that is most likely to be associated with more favorable PD-related peritonitis outcomes would be the one that indicates a higher level of experience and expertise in managing PD. 

Therefore, the answer is C. Centers with > 29% of dialysis patients treated with PD.
