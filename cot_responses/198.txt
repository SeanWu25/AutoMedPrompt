## Answer
The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are suggestive of membranous nephropathy (MN), a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. The presence of PLA2R antibodies is a characteristic feature of primary MN. 

Option A suggests deferring renal biopsy. However, renal biopsy is typically performed to confirm the diagnosis of MN and to rule out secondary causes. Therefore, this option is not correct.

Option B suggests monitoring serologies monthly and treating if PLA2R fails to decrease by > 25% in 3 months. However, the treatment of MN is not typically guided by PLA2R levels alone. Therefore, this option is not correct.

Option C refers to the MENTOR study, which compared rituximab with cyclosporine for the treatment of MN. However, the study found that patients treated with rituximab had a significantly higher rate of remission and a lower rate of relapse than those treated with cyclosporine. Therefore, this option is not correct.

Option D also refers to the MENTOR study and states that those treated with rituximab had higher rates of remission at 24-month-follow up. This is consistent with the findings of the MENTOR study, which found that rituximab was superior to cyclosporine in inducing remission of proteinuria and maintaining remission up to 24 months.

Therefore, the answer is D. In the MENTOR study, those treated with rituximab had higher rates of remission at 24-month-follow up.
