## Answer
Incretin-based therapies, such as sitagliptin, are a class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes. They work by increasing the amount of insulin your body produces in response to eating and by reducing the amount of glucose your liver produces. 

Option A suggests that incretin-based therapies increase the risk of hypoglycemia. However, these medications are known to have a low risk of hypoglycemia when used alone. 

Option B suggests that incretin-based therapies are associated with an increased risk of mortality when used in adults with non–dialysis-dependent CKD. However, studies have not shown a significant increase in mortality rates among patients with CKD using these medications.

Option D suggests that incretin-based therapies increase the rate of CKD progression. However, there is no evidence to suggest that these medications accelerate the progression of CKD. 

Option C states that incretin-based therapies are not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia or mortality among adults with non–dialysis-dependent CKD when compared with other glucose-lowering agents. This statement aligns with the current understanding of these medications. They are generally well-tolerated and do not increase the risk of hypoglycemia or mortality in patients with CKD.

Therefore, the answer is [C. Incretin-based therapies are not associated with an increased risk of hypoglycemia or mortality among adults with non–dialysis-dependent CKD when compared with other glucose-lowering agents].
