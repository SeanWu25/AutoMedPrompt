## Answer
The patient in the scenario is an 18-year-old Hispanic man with nephrotic syndrome and FSGS (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis) that is resistant to standard treatment with prednisone and angiotensin inhibition. 

Option A, genetic testing for a podocytopathy, is not the most appropriate next step. While genetic mutations can cause FSGS, they are typically seen in familial cases or in patients who present at a very young age. This patient has no family history of kidney disease and is 18 years old, which makes a genetic cause less likely.

Option B, determining the APOL1 risk allele status, is also not the most appropriate next step. APOL1 risk alleles are associated with a higher risk of FSGS and other kidney diseases in individuals of African descent. However, this patient is Hispanic, so testing for APOL1 risk alleles is less likely to be informative.

Option C, searching for an underlying lymphoma, is not the most appropriate next step. While malignancies like lymphoma can cause secondary FSGS, there is no indication in the patient's history or physical examination that suggests an underlying malignancy.

Option D, requesting a B7-1 (CD80) stain of the kidney biopsy specimen, is the most appropriate next step. B7-1 is a protein that is overexpressed in the podocytes of some patients with primary FSGS. Overexpression of B7-1 can cause proteinuria and FSGS, and it is associated with resistance to standard treatments, as seen in this patient. Therefore, staining the kidney biopsy for B7-1 could provide valuable information about the cause of this patient's FSGS and guide further treatment.

Therefore, the answer is D. Request B7-1 (CD80) stain of the kidney biopsy specimen.
