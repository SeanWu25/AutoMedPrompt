## Answer
The patient's hyperkalemia is likely due to the use of tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor that can cause hyperkalemia by decreasing renal potassium excretion. However, reducing the dose of tacrolimus is not the best initial approach to manage hyperkalemia in this patient because the tacrolimus level is within the therapeutic range and it is crucial for preventing transplant rejection.

Chlorthalidone (option B) is a thiazide diuretic that could potentially lower potassium levels by increasing renal potassium excretion. However, it can also exacerbate the patient's metabolic acidosis (indicated by a total CO2 of 18 mmol/L), which can in turn worsen hyperkalemia. Therefore, this is not the best choice.

Fludrocortisone (option C) is a mineralocorticoid that increases renal potassium excretion and sodium reabsorption. It could be useful in managing hyperkalemia, but it can also cause fluid retention and worsen hypertension, which is already a problem for this patient (BP is 160/94 mmHg). Therefore, this is not the best choice.

Sodium bicarbonate (option D) can help manage hyperkalemia by shifting potassium from the extracellular space to the intracellular space. It can also correct the patient's metabolic acidosis, which can help lower potassium levels. Therefore, this seems to be the best choice.

Therefore, the answer is D. Start sodium bicarbonate.
