## Answer
The patient has chronic hypercalcemia and high PTH level, which is indicative of hyperparathyroidism. However, the patient's alkaline phosphatase and phosphate serum levels are normal, which suggests that the bone turnover might not be high. 

Option A suggests starting an oral calcimimetic, which is used to treat hyperparathyroidism. However, this treatment is based on the assumption that the patient has high bone turnover, which might not be the case here.

Option C suggests scheduling a parathyroidectomy, which is a surgical procedure to remove the parathyroid glands. This is a more invasive approach and should be considered if other treatments are not effective or if the patient has severe symptoms. Again, this option assumes high bone turnover.

Option D suggests performing a DXA examination, which is a type of imaging test that measures bone density. This could provide useful information about the patient's bone health, but it does not directly address the patient's hyperparathyroidism.

Option B suggests obtaining a bone biopsy. This would provide definitive information about the patient's bone turnover. Given that the patient's alkaline phosphatase and phosphate serum levels are normal, it is possible that the patient has normal or low bone turnover despite the hyperparathyroidism. A bone biopsy would confirm this and guide further treatment.

Therefore, the answer is B. Try to obtain a bone biopsy, because hypercalcemic hyperparathyroidism in kidney-transplant recipients commonly does not represent high bone turnover but instead normal or low bone turnover.
