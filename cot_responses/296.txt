## Answer
The patient has been diagnosed with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1 and has been prescribed calcium and vitamin D. The potential complications of this therapy include nephrocalcinosis, brain calcifications, and nephrolithiasis. 

Nephrocalcinosis (A) is a condition that occurs when too much calcium is deposited in the kidneys. It's often caused by hypercalcemia, which can be a side effect of taking calcium supplements.

Brain calcifications (B) can occur due to an excess of calcium in the body, which can be caused by taking calcium supplements.

Nephrolithiasis (C) is the formation of kidney stones, which can occur when there is too much calcium in the urine, a potential side effect of taking calcium supplements.

Hypocalciuria (D), on the other hand, is a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of calcium in the urine. This is not a typical complication of calcium and vitamin D supplementation. In fact, these supplements would more likely cause hypercalciuria, or high levels of calcium in the urine, which could lead to the complications mentioned above.

Therefore, the answer is D. Hypocalciuria.
