## Answer
The patient's presentation of hypertension and hypokalemia (low potassium levels) with low renin and aldosterone levels suggests a diagnosis of apparent mineralocorticoid excess. This condition is characterized by an overactivity of mineralocorticoids, which leads to sodium retention, potassium loss, and hypertension. The most common cause of this syndrome is the ingestion of glycyrrhizic acid, a component of licorice and also found in some forms of chewing tobacco. This substance inhibits the enzyme 11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, which normally inactivates cortisol in the kidney. When this enzyme is inhibited, cortisol can act on mineralocorticoid receptors, mimicking the effect of aldosterone and leading to sodium retention, potassium loss, and hypertension. The other options are less likely: surreptitious diuretic abuse would typically cause a low sodium level, primary hyperaldosteronism would cause high aldosterone levels, and villous adenoma would typically present with secretory diarrhea and hypokalemia, but not hypertension. 
Therefore, the answer is B. Syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess due to glycyrrhizic acid.
