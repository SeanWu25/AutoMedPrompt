## Answer
Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is a significant cause of graft loss in transplant recipients. It is caused by the production of donor-specific antibodies that lead to inflammation and damage to the graft. The mainstay of treatment for AMR includes plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and rituximab. Plasmapheresis is used to remove circulating antibodies, IVIG is used to neutralize circulating antibodies, and rituximab is used to deplete B cells, which are responsible for antibody production. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, has been used in refractory cases of AMR, but the evidence supporting its use is not as strong as the combination of plasmapheresis, IVIG, and rituximab. Therefore, the answer is B. Plasmapheresis, IVIG, and rituximab.
