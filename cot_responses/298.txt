## Answer
To answer this question, we need to understand the mechanism of action of each of the listed drugs in relation to phosphate absorption.

A. Tenapanor is a sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) inhibitor that reduces the absorption of dietary phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract. It primarily acts on transcellular phosphate absorption.

B. Modified-release nicotinamide is a form of vitamin B3 that has been shown to reduce phosphate levels in patients with chronic kidney disease. It does this by inhibiting sodium-dependent phosphate co-transporters in the gut, which are responsible for transcellular phosphate absorption.

C. EOS789 is a novel phosphate binder that inhibits phosphate absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. It acts by binding to dietary phosphate in the gut, preventing its absorption. This is a form of transcellular phosphate absorption inhibition.

D. Ferric iron oxide adipate is a phosphate binder that binds to dietary phosphate in the gut, preventing its absorption. This is also a form of transcellular phosphate absorption inhibition.

From the above, it is clear that all the options except for Tenapanor primarily target transcellular phosphate absorption. Tenapanor, on the other hand, targets paracellular phosphate absorption.

Therefore, the answer is [A. Tenapanor].
