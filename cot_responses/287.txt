## Answer
To answer this question, we need to consider the characteristics and findings associated with lupus nephritis. 

Option A suggests that lupus nephritis is being diagnosed at a younger age. While lupus can indeed affect individuals at a young age, there is no specific trend indicating that the diagnosis of lupus nephritis is occurring at a younger age. 

Option B states that the time from diagnosis of SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) to the development of lupus nephritis is shorter in Blacks and other minority groups. This is indeed true. Several studies have shown that minority groups, including Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians, tend to develop lupus nephritis earlier and have a more severe disease course compared to Caucasians.

Option C suggests that in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis who undergo rebiopsy, histologic findings correlate closely with clinical response to treatment. This is not entirely accurate. While histologic findings can provide valuable information about the disease, they do not always correlate closely with clinical response to treatment. 

Option D states that Anti-PLA2R antibodies are frequently identified in patients with class 5 lupus nephritis. Anti-PLA2R antibodies are actually associated with primary membranous nephropathy, not lupus nephritis.

Therefore, the answer is [B. The time from diagnosis of SLE to the development of lupus nephritis is shorter in Blacks and other minority groups].
