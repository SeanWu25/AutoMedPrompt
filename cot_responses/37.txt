## Answer
The question is asking for the best advice regarding the outcomes of a patient with ESRD returning to peritoneal dialysis (PD) after an episode of refractory culture-negative peritonitis that required catheter removal and subsequent treatment with hemodialysis. 

Option A suggests that PD is unlikely to be successful due to adhesions and inadequate peritoneal membrane transport. However, the patient's physical examination does not indicate any abdominal abnormalities, and his dialysis adequacy while on PD was consistently above recommended guidelines, suggesting that his peritoneal membrane transport is adequate.

Option B suggests that his peritonitis-free survival after switching back to PD is comparable with that of those who did not require transfer to hemodialysis after experiencing peritonitis. This is a possibility, but it does not provide a definitive answer regarding the patient's specific situation.

Option C suggests that PD is not recommended because the patient is anuric. However, anuria does not contraindicate PD. In fact, PD can be beneficial for anuric patients as it allows for better fluid control.

Option D suggests that PD is not recommended because of an increased risk for recurrent peritonitis after an episode of culture-negative peritonitis. This is a valid concern, as peritonitis is a common complication of PD and can lead to catheter removal, hospitalization, and even death. However, the risk of recurrent peritonitis can be managed with appropriate antibiotic therapy and catheter care.

Therefore, the answer is [B. His peritonitis-free survival after switching back to PD is comparable with that of those who did not require transfer to hemodialysis after experiencing peritonitis]. This option provides the most accurate and relevant advice for the patient's specific situation.
