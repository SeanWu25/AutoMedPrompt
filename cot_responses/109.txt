## Answer
The patient's kidney biopsy shows a membranoproliferative pattern of glomerular injury with IgG deposits and k-light chains, specifically IgG3. This suggests a proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits (PGNMID). PGNMID is a form of glomerulonephritis that is associated with monoclonal gammopathy, a condition where the body produces a single type of immunoglobulin. 

Option A, urine protein electrophoresis, is used to identify the presence of abnormal proteins in the urine, which can indicate kidney disease. However, in this case, we already know that the patient has proteinuria and kidney disease, so this test would not provide any new information.

Option C, serum complement levels, can be used to assess the activity of the immune system. However, this test would not provide specific information about the type of immunoglobulin being produced, which is the key issue in this case.

Option D, laser dissection/mass spectrometry analysis of the kidney biopsy, could provide more detailed information about the kidney tissue. However, this is a complex and invasive procedure that is not typically used in the initial evaluation of kidney disease.

Option B, serum immunofixation plus serum free light chains, is the best choice. Serum immunofixation is used to identify and measure the levels of specific types of immunoglobulins in the blood. This can help to confirm the diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy and guide treatment decisions. Serum free light chains test is used to detect abnormal levels of light chains in the blood, which can indicate conditions such as multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders. 

Therefore, the answer is B. Serum immunoÔ¨Åxation plus serum free light chains.
