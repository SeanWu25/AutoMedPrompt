## Answer
The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest that she is experiencing worsening of her Fabry disease, a genetic disorder that results in the buildup of a certain type of fat in the body's cells. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including acroparesthesias (tingling or burning sensations in the hands and feet), which the patient is experiencing. 

Option A, no additional management, is not appropriate because the patient's symptoms are worsening and her urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio has significantly increased, indicating kidney damage.

Option B, enzyme replacement therapy, is a treatment for Fabry disease that can help reduce the buildup of fat in cells. However, it is not typically used to manage acute symptoms and it's not clear whether it's safe during pregnancy.

Option C, gabapentin, is a medication that can help manage neuropathic pain, such as the acroparesthesias the patient is experiencing. It is considered safe for use during pregnancy.

Option D, diltiazem, is a calcium channel blocker used to treat high blood pressure and chest pain. It is not typically used to manage symptoms of Fabry disease and it's not clear why it would be beneficial in this case.

Therefore, the answer is C. Gabapentin.
