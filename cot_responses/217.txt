## Answer
The patient's hyperkalemia is likely due to inadequate dialysis, as evidenced by her high predialysis potassium levels and her habit of signing off early from her dialysis sessions. Therefore, the best management strategy would be to increase her dialysis time to ensure adequate clearance of potassium. Dietary restriction alone is unlikely to be sufficient, as her diet has already been discussed many times with a dietician. Changing the dialysate potassium concentration to 1 mEq/L could potentially lead to too rapid a decrease in serum potassium levels, which could cause cardiac arrhythmias. Adding a potassium-binding resin on non-dialysis days could be an option, but it would be more appropriate to first optimize her dialysis regimen. Therefore, the answer is B. Increase dialysis time to D.5 hours, continue dialysate [K] 2mEq/L.
