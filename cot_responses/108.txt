## Answer
To answer this question, we need to understand the relationship between hepatitis C, cryoglobulinemia, and glomerulonephritis (GN). 

Option A suggests that interferon-based antiviral therapies do not decrease the chances of developing cryoglobulinemia and GN in patients infected with hepatitis C, genotype 1. This is incorrect. Interferon-based therapies have been shown to reduce the risk of these complications in patients with hepatitis C.

Option B states that GN cannot develop after successful treatment of hepatitis C with direct-acting anti-viral agents in patients who have achieved a sustained remission. This is also incorrect. Even after successful treatment, there is still a risk of developing GN due to the persistent immune response.

Option C suggests that late treatment with interferon-based anti-viral therapies is as effective as early treatment in preventing the kidney manifestations of hepatitis C. This is not true. Early treatment is generally more effective in preventing complications.

Option D states that cryoglobulinemia can occur with hepatitis C and hepatitis B. This is correct. Cryoglobulinemia is a common extrahepatic manifestation of both hepatitis C and hepatitis B.

Therefore, the answer is [D. Cryoglobulinemia can occur with hepatitis C and hepatitis B].
