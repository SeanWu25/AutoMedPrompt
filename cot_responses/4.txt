## Answer
The patient's hypertension is poorly controlled despite being on three antihypertensive medications. He also has sleep apnea, a condition that is known to contribute to hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line treatment for sleep apnea and has been shown to improve blood pressure control, particularly in patients with resistant hypertension like this patient. The patient's difficulty using the CPAP machine should be addressed, as regular use of it for at least 4 hours per night can help lower his blood pressure and improve his nocturnal blood pressure pattern. Nocturnal oxygen supplementation, psychotherapy, and device-guided breathing are not as effective as CPAP in managing hypertension in patients with sleep apnea. Therefore, the answer is [D. Regular use of continuous positive airway pressure for at least 4 hours per night].
