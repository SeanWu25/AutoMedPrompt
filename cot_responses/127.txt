## Answer
Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), also known as calciphylaxis, is a rare and serious disorder that presents with painful skin lesions and can lead to nonhealing ulcers and severe infections. It is most commonly seen in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The pathogenesis is thought to involve calcification of the arterioles leading to ischemia and necrosis of the surrounding tissues. Risk factors include female sex, obesity, diabetes mellitus, warfarin use, and elevated calcium-phosphorus product.

The management of CUA involves multiple strategies including wound care, pain management, control of hyperparathyroidism, avoidance of calcium-based binders, and discontinuation of vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin. Sodium thiosulfate may also be used, although the evidence supporting its use is limited.

Looking at the options, avoiding skin trauma and subcutaneous injections (Option A) is a good practice in general for patients with CUA, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case as the patient is already receiving wound care and pain management.

Discontinuing cinacalcet (Option B) is not appropriate as cinacalcet is used to control hyperparathyroidism, which is a risk factor for CUA. Similarly, increasing cinacalcet (Option C) is not indicated as the patient's parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is already within the target range for patients with ESRD.

Parathyroidectomy (Option D) is a treatment option for patients with severe, refractory hyperparathyroidism, but this patient's PTH level is not excessively high and there is no indication that her hyperparathyroidism is refractory to medical management.

Finally, transferring to peritoneal dialysis (PD) (Option E) is not indicated as there is no evidence that PD is superior to hemodialysis in the management of CUA.

Therefore, the answer is A. Avoid skin trauma and subcutaneous injections.
