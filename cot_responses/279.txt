## Answer
This patient's blood pressure was not controlled despite being on three different antihypertensive medications, which initially suggests resistant hypertension. However, after directly observing her take her medications, her blood pressure significantly improved. This suggests that the issue was not with the efficacy of the medications, but rather with the patient's adherence to her medication regimen. This is consistent with pseudoresistant hypertension, which is defined as apparent treatment-resistant hypertension due to nonadherence to therapy. Therefore, the answer is B. Pseudoresistant hypertension.
