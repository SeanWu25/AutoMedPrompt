## Answer
The patient's biopsy report describes double contours of the glomerular basement membrane, rare foci of tubulitis, interstitial inflammation, interstitial fibrosis with sclerosis of the cortical parenchyma, peritubular capillaritis with staining for the complement degradation product C4d, but no large vessel inflammation or hyalinosis. These findings are indicative of chronic damage rather than acute damage. The presence of a de novo donor-specific antibody to HLA A27 and C4d staining suggests that this is an antibody-mediated process. T cell-mediated rejection would typically present with more severe tubulitis and interstitial inflammation, which is not the case here. Therefore, the histologic diagnosis is not consistent with acute T cell-mediated rejection (option C), acute mixed T cell-mediated and antibody-mediated rejection (option B), or grade IA chronic active T cell-mediated rejection (option A). The findings are most consistent with chronic active antibody-mediated rejection (option D), which is characterized by the presence of donor-specific antibodies, C4d staining, and evidence of chronic tissue injury.
Therefore, the answer is [D. Chronic active antibody-mediated rejection].
