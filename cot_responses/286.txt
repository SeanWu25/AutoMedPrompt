## Answer
The patient's presentation of malaise, nausea, dyspnea, oligoanuria, elevated serum creatinine, MPO-ANCA positivity, and kidney biopsy findings are consistent with ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis (GN), a type of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. 

Option A is incorrect. Plasma exchange has been shown to improve renal outcomes in patients with severe ANCA-associated GN, particularly those with high levels of serum creatinine.

Option B is correct. A reduced dose glucocorticoid regimen has been shown to be as effective as a standard dose regimen in inducing remission in ANCA-associated GN. Furthermore, it is associated with fewer infections in patients treated with cyclophosphamide, which is an immunosuppressive drug that can increase the risk of infections.

Option C is incorrect. Avacopan, a C5a receptor inhibitor, has been shown to be non-inferior, not superior, to glucocorticoids for achieving sustained disease remission at 6 months in ANCA-associated GN.

Option D is correct. Both daily oral cyclophosphamide and rituximab infusions have been shown to be equally effective for the induction of remission in ANCA-associated GN. 

Option E is incorrect. While mycophenolate mofetil is associated with fewer side effects than cyclophosphamide, it has not been shown to be associated with fewer infections.

Therefore, the answer is [B, D].
