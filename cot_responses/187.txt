## Answer
When considering the first-line treatment for hypertension, it's important to consider the efficacy and side effect profiles of the potential medications. 

Option A suggests that dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have similar effectiveness in reducing hypertension-related complications. While both types of calcium channel blockers can be effective in managing hypertension, there isn't a clear consensus that they have similar effects on complications related to hypertension.

Option B suggests that chlorthalidone and hydrochlorothiazide have similar effects on rates of myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke, and have similar adverse effect profiles. While both are thiazide diuretics and are often used interchangeably in clinical practice, some studies suggest that chlorthalidone may be more effective at reducing cardiovascular events than hydrochlorothiazide, although this is still a topic of debate.

Option C suggests that treatment with thiazide diuretics has been associated with better BP control and reductions in cardiovascular outcomes, as compared with other first-line agents for management of hypertension. This is generally true, as thiazide diuretics are often recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension due to their proven efficacy in reducing blood pressure and preventing cardiovascular events.

Option D suggests that treatment with ACE inhibitors led to the greatest reduction in rates of stroke and hospitalization for heart failure compared with other first-line agents. While ACE inhibitors are effective in managing hypertension and have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke and heart failure, they are not universally considered to be superior to other first-line agents in these respects.

Therefore, the answer is [C]. Thiazide diuretics are often recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension due to their proven efficacy in reducing blood pressure and preventing cardiovascular events.
