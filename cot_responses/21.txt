## Answer
This patient has chronic hypertension and is now postpartum with a rising blood pressure. She also has a significantly elevated urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, indicating the presence of albuminuria, which is a marker of kidney damage often seen in patients with diabetes and hypertension. The goal of therapy in such patients is not only to lower blood pressure but also to reduce albuminuria, which can slow the progression of kidney disease. Among the options provided, Enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is known to reduce albuminuria in addition to its blood pressure-lowering effect. However, ACE inhibitors are generally avoided in breastfeeding women because they have been reported to cause anemia, renal failure, and other adverse effects in breastfed infants. Atenolol and Metoprolol are beta-blockers, which are also generally avoided in breastfeeding women because they can cause bradycardia, hypotension, and other adverse effects in breastfed infants. Hydrochlorothiazide, a thiazide diuretic, is considered safe in breastfeeding women and can be used to treat hypertension. Therefore, the answer is A. Hydrochlorothiazide.
