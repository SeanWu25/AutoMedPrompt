## Answer
The patient's clinical picture is suggestive of acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to sepsis from pneumonia. The oliguria and the increase in creatinine from 1.1 to 1.4 mg/dL are indicative of this. The Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial Lite Fluid Management Protocol is a strategy used to manage fluid balance in critically ill patients. The goal is to avoid fluid overload, which can worsen outcomes in patients with conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis. 

Option A suggests giving a fluid bolus and reassessing in 1 hour. However, the patient's central venous pressure is 7 cm H2O, which is within the normal range (5-10 cm H2O), indicating that he is not hypovolemic. Therefore, a fluid bolus may not be necessary and could potentially lead to fluid overload.

Option B suggests giving dopamine at a dose of 1 Âµg/kg per minute. Dopamine at low doses can increase renal blood flow and urine output. However, it has not been shown to improve outcomes in patients with AKI and is not recommended as a first-line treatment.

Option C suggests giving intravenous furosemide 20 mg and reassessing in 4 hours. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that can increase urine output. However, it does not improve kidney function or survival in patients with AKI and can lead to side effects such as electrolyte imbalances.

Option D suggests no intervention and reassessing in 4 hours. Given the patient's stable hemodynamics and the absence of severe volume overload, this would be the most appropriate approach. The patient's AKI is likely due to sepsis, and the primary treatment should be addressing the underlying infection, which is already being done with antibiotics.

Therefore, the answer is D. No intervention and reassess in 4 hours.
