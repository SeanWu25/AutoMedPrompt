## Answer
The QTc interval is a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the heart's electrical cycle. A prolonged QTc interval can increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Certain medications can cause QTc prolongation, including some antidepressants, diuretics, and antiarrhythmics.

A. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that can cause electrolyte imbalances, which can indirectly lead to QTc prolongation.

B. Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor used for GERD. It is not typically associated with QTc prolongation.

C. Citalopram is an SSRI antidepressant. It is known to cause QTc prolongation, especially at higher doses.

D. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug that is well known to cause QTc prolongation.

Therefore, the medication least likely to be contributing to the increased QTc interval is pantoprazole.

Therefore, the answer is B. Pantoprazole.
