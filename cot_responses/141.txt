## Answer
The question is asking for a biomarker that can predict renal tubular injury beyond what can be predicted by serum creatinine levels. Serum creatinine is a common marker for kidney function, but it is not sensitive enough to detect early stages of kidney injury, especially tubular injury. 

Option A, Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1), is a type of protein that is highly upregulated in the proximal tubule cells of the kidney after injury. It is a sensitive and specific marker for renal proximal tubule injury.

Option B, Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL), is a protein that is upregulated in response to kidney injury. It is a sensitive marker for acute kidney injury, but it is not specific to renal tubular injury.

Option C, Liver-Fatty Acid Binding Protein (L-FABP), is a protein that is expressed in the liver, but it is also found in the kidney. It is a marker for tubulointerstitial damage in the kidney, but it is not as specific as KIM-1 for renal tubular injury.

Option D, Interleukin-18 (IL-18), is a proinflammatory cytokine that is produced in response to injury, including kidney injury. However, it is not specific to renal tubular injury.

Given these considerations, KIM-1 (Option A) is the most specific marker for renal tubular injury among the options provided. 

Therefore, the answer is [A. Urine kidney injury molecule-1].
