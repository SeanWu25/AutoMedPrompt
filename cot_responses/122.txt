## Answer
The question is asking about the effects of reducing the dialysate calcium level from 3.5 mEq/L to 2.5 mEq/L in a patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 

Option A suggests a significant reduction in mortality. However, there is no strong evidence to suggest that a decrease in dialysate calcium level directly leads to a significant reduction in mortality.

Option B suggests no change in histologically evident low-turnover bone disease. Low-turnover bone disease is a common complication in patients with ESRD, but it is primarily related to parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels rather than dialysate calcium levels.

Option C suggests a decrease in mean cancellous bone volume. This is a plausible outcome as lower dialysate calcium levels could lead to lower serum calcium levels, which could in turn stimulate PTH secretion and increase bone turnover, potentially leading to a decrease in bone volume.

Option D suggests a reduction in the progression of coronary artery calcification. While it is true that high calcium levels can contribute to vascular calcification, the relationship between dialysate calcium levels and coronary artery calcification is complex and not fully understood. 

Therefore, the answer is C. A decrease in mean cancellous bone volume.
