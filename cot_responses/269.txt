## Answer
The patient's presentation includes weight gain, difficulty sleeping, feeling tired and "groggy", and elevated blood pressure. These symptoms, along with her weight gain, could be indicative of uncontrolled hypertension. Uncontrolled hypertension is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in kidney transplant recipients. Therefore, managing her hypertension is crucial for her long-term survival.

Option A, malignant transformation of polycystic kidneys to renal cell carcinoma, is a possibility but it is a rare complication and the patient's symptoms do not specifically suggest this.

Option C, allograft rejection due to subtherapeutic tacrolimus, is unlikely as the patient's creatinine level is normal and there is no evidence of proteinuria or hematuria, which would be expected in the case of rejection.

Option D, development of post-transplantation diabetes mellitus, is a possibility given her weight gain. However, her fasting blood glucose level is normal, suggesting that she does not currently have diabetes.

Therefore, the answer is B. Uncontrolled hypertension with concern for pulmonary hypertension.
