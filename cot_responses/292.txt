## Answer
The patient's symptoms of severe flank pain, significant proteinuria (14 g in 24 hours), and hematuria suggest a kidney disease. The absence of costoverterbral angle tenderness and negative leukocyte esterase make pyelonephritis less likely, ruling out option B. The normal abdominal imaging rules out renal vein thrombosis and kidney stones, making option C less likely. The patient's known history of hepatitis B and poor compliance with antiviral therapy suggest that his kidney disease could be related to his hepatitis B infection. Hepatitis B virus is known to cause membranous nephropathy (MN), a type of nephrotic syndrome. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to start antiviral therapy for presumed hepatitis B virus–associated MN, making option D the best choice. A kidney biopsy (option A) could be considered later if the patient does not respond to antiviral therapy or if there is a need to confirm the diagnosis.
Therefore, the answer is [D. Begin antiviral therapy for presumed hepatitis B virus–associated MN].
