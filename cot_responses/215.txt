## Answer
The patient's history of recurrent nephrolithiasis and possible medullary sponge kidney suggests a metabolic abnormality leading to stone formation. Medullary sponge kidney is a congenital disorder characterized by cystic dilatation of the collecting tubules in one or both kidneys and is associated with nephrolithiasis. The most common type of kidney stones are calcium stones, often in the form of calcium oxalate. These stones form when the concentration of calcium in the urine is high, a condition known as hypercalciuria. Hypercalciuria can be due to increased intestinal absorption, increased bone resorption, or decreased renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. The patient's history of osteopenia, a condition characterized by decreased bone density, could be a result of increased bone resorption leading to hypercalciuria. Therefore, the most likely abnormality detected on a 24-hour urine metabolic study in this patient would be high calcium.

Therefore, the answer is [A. High calcium].
