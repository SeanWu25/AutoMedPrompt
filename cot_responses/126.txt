Matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a vitamin K-dependent protein that inhibits vascular calcification. It exists in two forms: carboxylated and uncarboxylated. The carboxylated form is active and inhibits calcification, while the uncarboxylated form is inactive. In patients with calciphylaxis, a severe complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) characterized by vascular calcification and skin necrosis, the fraction of total MGP that is carboxylated is typically lower. This is because vitamin K deficiency, common in ESRD, leads to undercarboxylation of MGP, reducing its ability to inhibit calcification. Therefore, patients with calciphylaxis are more likely to have a higher proportion of uncarboxylated (inactive) MGP, leading to increased vascular calcification. 

Therefore, the answer is [A. Her fraction of total MGP that is carboxylated is more likely to be lower].
