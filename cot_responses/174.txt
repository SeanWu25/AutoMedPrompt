## Answer
To answer this question, we need to consider which of the options is most relevant and accurate in the context of cardiovascular risk prediction in CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease) practice.

Option A suggests that coronary flow reserve declines with kidney disease progression and that cardiovascular risk is amplified in patients with advanced CKD. This is a known fact and is relevant to the topic.

Option B states that elevations in NT-proBNP are not associated with an increased risk of subsequent cardiac events. This is incorrect as elevated levels of NT-proBNP are indeed associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.

Option C suggests that adding echocardiographic variables to clinical variables and NT-proBNP improves cardiovascular risk prediction. This is also true and relevant to the topic.

Option D states that coronary artery calcification in CKD is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. This is also a known fact and is relevant to the topic.

However, the question asks for the "new" methods of cardiovascular risk prediction in CKD practice. Options A and D are well-established facts and are not considered "new". Option B is incorrect. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is option C, which suggests a new method of improving cardiovascular risk prediction by adding echocardiographic variables to clinical variables and NT-proBNP.

Therefore, the answer is C.
