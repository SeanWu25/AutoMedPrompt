## Answer
During pregnancy, there are several physiological changes that occur in the body to accommodate the growing fetus and prepare for childbirth. One of these changes involves the renal system. The Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) and renal blood flow increase significantly during pregnancy to help excrete waste products from both the mother and the fetus. This increase is due to the hormonal changes during pregnancy, which cause vasodilation and an increase in blood volume. By the end of the third trimester, the GFR and renal blood flow do not return to pre-pregnancy levels, but remain elevated. Therefore, the options stating that GFR and renal blood flow return to pre-pregnancy levels (B and D) are incorrect. The option stating that GFR is decreased by 10% compared to pre-pregnancy levels (A) is also incorrect, as GFR actually increases during pregnancy. The correct answer is that renal blood flow is increased by 50% compared to pre-pregnancy levels (C).
Therefore, the answer is C. Renal blood flow is increased by 50% compared to pre-pregnancy levels.
