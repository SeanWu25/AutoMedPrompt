## Answer
First, let's consider each option individually. 

Option A suggests that survival with a catheter is likely to be similar to that achieved with a fistula or a graft. However, this is not accurate. Studies have shown that arteriovenous fistulas and grafts are associated with better survival rates compared to catheters.

Option B states that the catheter dependence period is likely to be higher during the first 6 months with a graft than with a fistula. This is also not accurate. The maturation time for a fistula is typically longer than that for a graft, which means that patients are likely to be dependent on a catheter for a longer period of time if they have a fistula.

Option C and D suggest that infection-related hospitalization, septicemia-related or bacteremia-related hospitalization is more likely with fistulas. This is not true. Fistulas are generally associated with a lower risk of infection compared to catheters and grafts.

Option E states that the risk of death is lower with fistulas than with grafts. This is accurate. Fistulas are considered the gold standard for vascular access in hemodialysis patients because they are associated with lower rates of complications, including infection and death, compared to grafts and catheters.

Therefore, the answer is [E. The risk of death is lower with fistulas than with grafts].
