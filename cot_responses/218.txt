## Answer
The patient is presenting with pulmonary edema, which is a common complication in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). This is often due to fluid overload, which can occur if the patient is not adequately dialyzed or if they gain too much fluid between dialysis sessions. 

Option A suggests decreasing her estimated dry weight (EDW) to 62 kg. However, this may not be the best approach as it could lead to hypotension during dialysis and may not necessarily prevent fluid overload if the patient continues to gain fluid between dialysis sessions.

Option B suggests doubling her ultrafiltration rate (UFR) to ensure she always leaves at her EDW. While this could potentially help to remove more fluid during dialysis, it could also lead to rapid fluid shifts and hemodynamic instability, which could be harmful.

Option C suggests adding a loop diuretic on non-dialysis days and continuing to limit her UFR during dialysis to < 13 ml/kg per hour. This seems to be the most reasonable approach. Loop diuretics can help to remove excess fluid on non-dialysis days, which could help to prevent fluid overload and subsequent pulmonary edema. Limiting the UFR during dialysis can help to prevent rapid fluid shifts and maintain hemodynamic stability.

Therefore, the answer is [C. Add a loop diuretic on non-dialysis days and continue to limit her UFR during dialysis to < 13 ml/kg per h].
