## Answer
Fabry disease is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, which is encoded by the GLA gene. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down a specific type of fat called globotriaosylceramide (GB3). When this enzyme is deficient, GB3 accumulates in various cells and tissues in the body, leading to the symptoms of Fabry disease. Therefore, the pathophysiologic pathway of Fabry disease involves a GLA mutation leading to alpha-galactosidase A deficiency, which in turn leads to GB3 accumulation. This is consistent with option A. The other options involve either a deficiency of beta-galactosidase A, which is not associated with Fabry disease, or the accumulation of lyso-GB3, which is a breakdown product of GB3 and not the primary substance that accumulates in Fabry disease. Option E involves silencing of X-linked genes, which is not the primary mechanism of Fabry disease.
Therefore, the answer is [A. GLA mutation, α-galactosidase A deﬁciency, GB3 accumulation].
