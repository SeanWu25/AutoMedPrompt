## Answer
The question asks for the factor that does NOT explain the higher incidence rate of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among blacks compared with whites in the United States. 

Option A suggests a faster rate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline. This is a plausible explanation for the higher incidence of ESRD among blacks, as a faster decline in GFR would lead to kidney failure more quickly.

Option B suggests a lower mean GFR at baseline. This is also a plausible explanation, as a lower baseline GFR would mean that the kidneys are already functioning at a lower capacity, making it more likely for the individual to progress to ESRD.

Option C suggests a lower competing risk of mortality. This means that blacks may live longer than whites, giving them more time to develop ESRD. This is also a plausible explanation.

Option D suggests a higher prevalence of albuminuria. Albuminuria is a common sign of kidney damage, and a higher prevalence of albuminuria among blacks would suggest a higher incidence of kidney damage and, therefore, a higher incidence of ESRD.

Therefore, all options A, B, C, and D could potentially explain the higher incidence of ESRD among blacks. However, the question asks for the factor that does NOT explain this higher incidence. 

Given the above reasoning, all options seem to contribute to the higher incidence of ESRD among blacks. However, option C, a lower competing risk of mortality, is the least direct contributor. While it is true that a lower competing risk of mortality could potentially lead to a higher incidence of ESRD (simply because individuals are living longer and therefore have more time to develop ESRD), it is not a direct cause of kidney disease. The other options (A, B, and D) are all direct causes or indicators of kidney disease.

Therefore, the answer is C. A lower competing risk of mortality.
