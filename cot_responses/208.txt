The COMBINE trial was a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the effects of nicotinamide and lanthanum carbonate, alone and in combination, on serum phosphorus in patients with CKD. The results of the trial showed that both nicotinamide and lanthanum carbonate were effective in reducing serum phosphorus levels, but the combination of the two did not provide additional benefit. 

Option A suggests that the addition of nicotinamide to lanthanum carbonate is more effective than lanthanum carbonate alone for lowering serum PTH in patients with stage 4 CKD. However, the COMBINE trial did not show a significant difference in the reduction of serum PTH levels between the two treatments.

Option B suggests that lanthanum carbonate therapy can be expected to lower serum FGF23 concentrations by at least 30% in patients with stage 4 CKD. However, the COMBINE trial did not specifically evaluate the effect of lanthanum carbonate on serum FGF23 concentrations.

Option C suggests that lanthanum carbonate plus nicotinamide should be considered as a first-line therapy for reducing serum phosphorus in patients with stage 4 CKD. However, the COMBINE trial did not show that the combination of the two treatments provided additional benefit over either treatment alone.

Option D suggests that treatment with lanthanum carbonate either alone or in combination with nicotinamide has little effect on serum PTH in patients with stage 4 CKD. This statement is consistent with the results of the COMBINE trial, which did not show a significant difference in the reduction of serum PTH levels between the two treatments.

Therefore, the answer is D. Treatment with lanthanum carbonate either alone or in combination with nicotinamide has little effect on serum PTH in patients with stage 4 CKD.
