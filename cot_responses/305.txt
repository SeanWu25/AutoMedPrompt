## Answer
Calciphylaxis is a rare and serious condition that causes calcification of the small and medium-sized blood vessels in the skin and subcutaneous fat. It is most commonly seen in patients with end-stage renal disease, but can also occur in patients with normal renal function, as in this case. The condition is associated with a high mortality rate, particularly in patients with renal disease. 

Option A suggests starting Teriparatide, a drug used to treat osteoporosis, not calciphylaxis. Option C suggests starting Calcitriol, a form of vitamin D. While vitamin D is important for calcium regulation, it is not the primary treatment for calciphylaxis. Option D suggests starting Sevelamer, a phosphate binder used in kidney disease to prevent hyperphosphatemia. This patient's phosphorus levels are normal, so this treatment would not be appropriate.

Option B states that the 1-year survival rate is likely higher in this patient compared to dialysis-dependent patients with end-stage kidney disease who develop calciphylaxis. This is the most correct statement. Calciphylaxis has a high mortality rate, particularly in patients with renal disease. However, patients with normal renal function, like this patient, generally have a better prognosis than those with end-stage renal disease.

Therefore, the answer is [B].
