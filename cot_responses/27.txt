## Answer
The patient in the scenario has primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a condition that can lead to nephrotic syndrome, characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Despite initial treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and renin-angiotensin system inhibition, the patient still has significant proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia, indicating that the disease is not fully controlled. 

Option A suggests continuing steroids at a reduced dosage. However, the patient's disease has not responded adequately to high-dose steroids, so it is unlikely that reducing the dosage will improve the situation.

Option B suggests using oral cyclosporine and low-dose steroids. Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor that can be effective in treating FSGS, especially in patients who are resistant to steroids. 

Option C suggests using rituximab and tapering doses of steroids. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD20, a protein expressed on the surface of B cells. It has been used in the treatment of steroid-resistant FSGS, but its efficacy is not as well established as that of cyclosporine.

Option D suggests using corticotropin injection gel and tapering of oral steroids. Corticotropin, also known as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. It has been used in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome, but its efficacy in FSGS is not well established.

Option E suggests using mycophenolate mofetil and tapering dosage of steroids. Mycophenolate mofetil is an immunosuppressive drug that inhibits the proliferation of T and B cells. It has been used in the treatment of FSGS, but its efficacy is not as well established as that of cyclosporine.

Given the patient's lack of response to high-dose steroids and the need for a more effective treatment, cyclosporine seems to be the most appropriate choice. Therefore, the answer is B. Oral cyclosporine and low-dose steroids for  greater than or equal to 4 months.
