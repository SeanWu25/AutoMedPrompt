## Answer
The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are suggestive of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome, a severe form of preeclampsia. This is evidenced by the presence of schistocytes on peripheral blood smear (indicating hemolysis), elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), and thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). The increase in blood pressure and the presence of protein and blood in the urine further support this diagnosis. 

The most appropriate management for HELLP syndrome is delivery of the fetus, which has already occurred in this case. Postpartum, the management of HELLP syndrome is largely supportive, including blood product transfusion if indicated. 

Option A, transfusion of platelets and packed red blood cells, would be appropriate if there were signs of ongoing bleeding or severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20,000 per ml). In this case, the patient's platelet count is low but not critically low, and there are no signs of ongoing bleeding.

Option B, plasma exchange, and option C, eculizumab, are treatments for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), respectively. These conditions can present similarly to HELLP syndrome but are less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

Option D, dexamethasone, is sometimes used in the management of HELLP syndrome, but its use is controversial and not universally recommended.

Option E, recombinant factor VIIa, is used in the management of bleeding in patients with hemophilia, and is not indicated in this case.

Therefore, the answer is A. Transfuse platelets and packed red blood cells.
