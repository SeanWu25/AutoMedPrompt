## Answer
The patient's symptoms of severe right flank pain, history of nephrolithiasis, and urinalysis findings of hematuria are suggestive of a kidney stone. The best next step in the diagnosis of suspected nephrolithiasis is noncontrast spiral (helical) computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis. This test has largely replaced intravenous pyelography because it is highly sensitive (94%-97%) and specific (96%-100%) for stones in the urinary tract. It can detect stones of any size throughout the urinary tract and can identify alternative diagnoses if no stone is found. Contrast is not typically used because it may obscure stones. Ultrasonography, MRI, and abdominal radiographs are less sensitive and specific than noncontrast CT for the detection of kidney stones. Therefore, the answer is [A. Spiral CT scan without contrast].
