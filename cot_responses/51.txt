## Answer
The patient has stage 3b:A3 CKD and is scheduled for a coronary angiography. Metformin is a medication that can potentially cause lactic acidosis, especially in patients with impaired renal function. The risk of lactic acidosis is increased when metformin is used in patients with renal impairment and in those undergoing procedures that may cause acute kidney injury, such as coronary angiography with the use of iodinated contrast media. Therefore, it is recommended to discontinue metformin 2-3 days before the procedure to reduce the risk of lactic acidosis. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor and does not need to be discontinued before the procedure. Chlorthalidone is a diuretic and does not need to be discontinued before the procedure. Therefore, the answer is A. Discontinue metformin 2â€“3 days before CA.
