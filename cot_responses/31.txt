## Answer
Parathyroidectomy is a surgical procedure that is performed to treat hyperparathyroidism, a condition characterized by an overproduction of parathyroid hormone by the parathyroid glands. This condition is common in patients on dialysis due to chronic kidney disease. 

Option A suggests that outpatient minimally invasive parathyroidectomy can achieve excellent control of secondary hyperparathyroidism. While minimally invasive parathyroidectomy can be performed on an outpatient basis and can effectively control secondary hyperparathyroidism, it is not always the best option for all patients, especially those with severe or persistent disease.

Option B states that all surgical approaches, such as partial, subtotal, or total parathyroidectomy with or without autotransplantation, are effective. This is generally true as the choice of surgical approach depends on the individual patient's condition and the surgeon's expertise. 

Option C suggests that hospital admission is uncommon after parathyroidectomy. This is not necessarily true as the need for hospital admission after parathyroidectomy depends on the patient's overall health, the extent of the disease, and the type of surgical procedure performed. 

Option D states that patients with a history of parathyroidectomy have an increased risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared with patients with similar degrees of hyperparathyroidism. This is not necessarily true as the risk of mortality after parathyroidectomy depends on various factors, including the patient's overall health, the extent of the disease, and the type of surgical procedure performed.

Therefore, the answer is B. All surgical approaches, such as partial, subtotal, or total parathyroidectomy with or without autotransplantation, are effective.
