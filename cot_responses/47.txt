## Answer
The patient's presentation is suggestive of a catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) due to Staphylococcus aureus, which is a common cause of bacteremia in hemodialysis patients. The catheter has been removed and appropriate antibiotics have been started, which are the initial steps in management. However, S. aureus bacteremia is associated with a high risk of metastatic infection, including endocarditis, which can occur even in patients without preexisting heart disease. The presence of a new murmur in this patient raises the suspicion for endocarditis. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography for the detection of endocarditis and is indicated in patients with S. aureus bacteremia and a new murmur. Therefore, the next best step in management is to perform a TEE to rule out endocarditis. The other options (arranging for placement of a new dialysis catheter, MRI of the spine, bone scan, and examination for an occult dental source of bacteremia) are not immediately necessary given the current clinical scenario. Therefore, the answer is B. Transesophageal echocardiography.
