## Answer
First, let's evaluate each option:

Option A suggests that the patient would do better with transplantation than with dialysis, but the waiting time would be longer due to his HIV status. This is partially true. Transplantation generally provides a better quality of life and survival rate than dialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease. However, the waiting time for transplantation is not necessarily longer for HIV-positive patients. 

Option B suggests that the patient would do better with dialysis because the immunosuppressive medications required for transplantation could activate HIV replication. This is not entirely accurate. While it's true that immunosuppressive medications can potentially increase the risk of HIV replication, with effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-positive patients can successfully undergo transplantation.

Option C suggests that the patient should do fine with transplantation because the risks are identical to those of HIV-negative patients, including the risk of rejection. This is not accurate. HIV-positive patients do face additional risks compared to HIV-negative patients, including a higher risk of infection due to their compromised immune system.

Option D suggests that the patient would do better with transplantation than with dialysis and should be referred for evaluation. This is generally true. Transplantation is often a better option than dialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease, including those who are HIV-positive. However, the decision should be individualized based on the patient's overall health status, potential risks, and benefits.

Therefore, the answer is [D. He would do better with transplantation than with dialysis and should be referred for evaluation].
