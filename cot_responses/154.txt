## Answer
The question is asking for the action that represents a breach in proper infection control practices. Let's analyze each option:

A. Placement of a nonsterile gauze pad at the cannulation site: This is not a breach in infection control practices. Nonsterile gauze pads are commonly used to cover the cannulation site after hemostasis is achieved.

B. Failure to apply antibiotic ointment at the arterial or venous sites cannulation sites before placing the dressing: This is not a standard practice in dialysis centers. Therefore, not applying antibiotic ointment does not represent a breach in infection control practices.

C. Failure to perform proper hand hygiene between patient encounters: This is a clear breach in infection control practices. Hand hygiene is a fundamental practice to prevent the spread of infections between patients.

D. Failure to use sterile gloves during decannulation: Sterile gloves are not required for decannulation. Nonsterile gloves are acceptable as long as they are changed between patients.

Therefore, the answer is [C. Failure to perform proper hand hygiene between patient encounters].
