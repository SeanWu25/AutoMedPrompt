## Answer
To answer this question, we need to consider the information provided in the context and the specifics of each answer choice. 

Option A suggests that hypertension treatment and control rates improved for all racial and ethnic groups. While this may be true, it doesn't specifically address the disparities between different racial and ethnic groups, which is the focus of the question.

Option B suggests that black patients had lower control rates due to lower intensity of treatment by their providers. This is a specific claim that would require specific evidence to support, which is not provided in the context.

Option C states that black patients had the lowest hypertension control rates. This is a plausible answer, as it directly addresses the issue of racial and ethnic disparities in hypertension treatment and control. However, we would need to confirm this with the data from the NHANES analysis.

Option D suggests that differences in hypertension control were caused by economic disparities across racial and ethnic groups. While socioeconomic factors can certainly influence health outcomes, the context does not provide specific evidence to support this claim.

Given the information provided, the most likely answer is C, as it directly addresses the disparities in hypertension control rates among different racial and ethnic groups. However, without specific data from the NHANES analysis, this is an educated guess rather than a definitive answer.

Therefore, the answer is [C].
