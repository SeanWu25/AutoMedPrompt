## Answer
The T50 test is a measure of the time it takes for serum to calcify in vitro. A longer T50 time indicates a lower propensity for calcification, which is desirable. Factors that can increase T50 time (reduce calcification propensity) include higher serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium inhibits the formation of calcium phosphate crystals, the primary constituent of vascular calcification. Therefore, increasing the magnesium concentration in the dialysis bath would increase the patient's serum magnesium levels and potentially increase the T50 time. The other options (A, B, and D) do not directly influence serum calcification propensity. Sodium and potassium levels in the dialysis bath primarily affect electrolyte balance and not calcification. Increasing dialysis time (Kt/V) improves the overall efficiency of dialysis but does not specifically target calcification propensity.
Therefore, the answer is C. Change magnesium to 2 mg/dl.
