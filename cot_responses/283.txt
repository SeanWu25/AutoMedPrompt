## Answer
The patient has FSGS (Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis), a kidney disease that causes damage to the glomeruli, the filtering units of the kidney. The patient's proteinuria has improved from 3.9 g/24 h to 2.3 g/24 h, which indicates that the current treatment is working. His blood pressure is also well controlled. 

Option A, initiating an SGLT2 inhibitor, is not the best choice because these drugs are primarily used for managing diabetes and there is no mention of the patient having diabetes. 

Option C, referring for genetic testing, is not necessary because the patient has no known family history of FSGS. Genetic testing is usually considered when there is a family history or when the disease presents at a young age.

Option D, adding an ARB (Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker) to help lower proteinuria, is not the best choice because the patient's proteinuria has already improved with the current treatment and his blood pressure is well controlled. Adding an ARB could potentially lead to hyperkalemia or worsen renal function.

Option B, making no changes, seems to be the best choice because the patient's condition is improving with the current treatment and there are no indications that a change in treatment is necessary.

Therefore, the answer is B. Make no changes.
