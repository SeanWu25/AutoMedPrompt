## Answer
The question is asking about the effectiveness of home blood pressure (BP) monitoring in the management of hypertension. 

Option A is not directly related to the effectiveness of home BP monitoring, but rather to its implementation in routine care. 

Option B suggests that home BP monitoring with feedback from a healthcare provider is effective but more costly. This is plausible, as the additional cost could be associated with the purchase of a home BP monitor and the time spent by healthcare providers reviewing and providing feedback on the readings. 

Option C contradicts option B by stating that home BP monitoring with healthcare provider feedback is ineffective and more costly. 

Option D states that home BP monitoring with regular transmission for feedback and medication adjustment has been shown to significantly improve BP. This is the most directly related to the question, as it speaks to the effectiveness of home BP monitoring in improving BP control, which is the primary goal in the management of hypertension.

Therefore, the answer is [D. Use of home BP monitoring with transmission regularly for feedback to healthcare provider and adjustment of medications has been shown to signiÔ¨Åcantly improve BP].
