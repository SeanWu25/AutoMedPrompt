## Answer
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome and end-stage renal disease. It can be caused by both genetic and non-genetic factors. The question asks about the most common genetic finding in populations with FSGS, apart from APOL1.

Option A, COL4A, refers to a family of genes that encode type IV collagen. Mutations in these genes are most commonly associated with Alport syndrome, which is characterized by progressive kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities.

Option B, UMOD, refers to the gene that encodes uromodulin. Mutations in this gene are associated with several types of inherited kidney diseases, including familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease, and glomerulocystic kidney disease.

Option C, NPHP, refers to a family of genes associated with nephronophthisis, a group of autosomal recessive kidney diseases that cause chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy.

Option D, Cubilin, is a gene that encodes a protein involved in the reabsorption of certain molecules in the kidneys. Mutations in this gene can cause Imerslund-Gr√§sbeck syndrome, which is characterized by megaloblastic anemia and proteinuria.

Given these considerations, the most common genetic finding in populations with FSGS, apart from APOL1, would be variants in the COL4A gene family. This is because mutations in these genes can cause Alport syndrome, which often presents with FSGS.

Therefore, the answer is A. COL4A.
