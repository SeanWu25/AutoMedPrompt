## Answer
The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of acute kidney injury (AKI) with an elevated serum creatinine level. The patient is on combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab, both of which are immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) used in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. ICIs can cause immune-related adverse events, including nephrotoxicity, which typically manifests as acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN). The presence of leukocytes and leukocyte casts in the urine, as well as the elevated eosinophil count, further support the diagnosis of ATIN. Podocyte injury is not typically associated with ICI-induced nephrotoxicity. The other options (B-E) are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation and the known side effects of the medications he is taking. Thrombotic microangiopathy, immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis, minimal change disease with acute tubular necrosis, and secondary membranous nephropathy are not typically associated with ICI therapy. Therefore, the answer is A. Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis with podocyte injury.
