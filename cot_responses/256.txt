## Answer
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression can be slowed down by several factors. 

Option A, fragmented and less sleep duration, is not associated with slower progression of CKD. In fact, poor sleep quality and duration can contribute to the progression of various diseases, including CKD.

Option B, higher dietary animal protein intake, is also not associated with slower progression of CKD. High protein diets, particularly animal protein, can increase the workload on the kidneys and potentially accelerate kidney damage.

Option C, high urine NGAL levels, is not associated with slower progression of CKD. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a biomarker of kidney injury. Higher levels indicate more kidney damage, not less.

Option D, use of allopurinol in patients with normal uric acid, is not associated with slower progression of CKD. Allopurinol is used to lower uric acid levels in patients with gout or kidney stones, but there's no evidence that it slows CKD progression in patients with normal uric acid levels.

Option E, increased intake of fruits and vegetables, is associated with slower progression of CKD. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables can help control blood pressure and blood glucose levels, reduce body weight, and decrease inflammation, all of which can slow the progression of CKD.

Therefore, the answer is [E. Increased intake of fruits and vegetables].
