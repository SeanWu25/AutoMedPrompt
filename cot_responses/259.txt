## Answer
Primary membranous nephropathy is an autoimmune disease that affects the kidneys. It is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against certain antigens present in the glomerular basement membrane. The most common autoantigen identified in primary membranous nephropathy is the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R). Other autoantigens that have been identified include thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A), neural epidermal growth factor-like 1 protein (NELL-1), and semaphorin 3B (Sema 3B). EXT1/EXT2 are genes associated with hereditary multiple exostoses, a condition characterized by multiple bone growths (exostoses), and have not been identified as autoantigens in primary membranous nephropathy. TNFR1 is a receptor for tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and has also not been identified as an autoantigen in primary membranous nephropathy. Therefore, the answer is A. EXT1/EXT2 and B. TNFR1.
