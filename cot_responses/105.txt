## Answer
The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN), also known as benign familial hematuria. This condition is characterized by persistent or intermittent hematuria, normal renal function, and thinning of the glomerular basement membrane. It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means that siblings and offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. Therefore, the statement A is correct.

The prognosis of TBMN is generally good, with most patients maintaining normal renal function throughout their lives. However, a small percentage of patients may develop progressive renal disease. Hence, statement B is also correct.

A kidney biopsy in TBMN would indeed show thinning of the glomerular basement membrane, so statement C is correct.

However, statement D is incorrect. TBMN is most commonly caused by mutations in the COL4A3 or COL4A4 genes, which encode the alpha-3 and alpha-4 chains of type IV collagen, respectively. The alpha-5 chain of type IV collagen, encoded by the COL4A5 gene, is associated with Alport syndrome, a different condition that also leads to hematuria but is typically associated with hearing loss and eye abnormalities.

Therefore, the answer is [D].
