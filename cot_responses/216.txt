## Answer
Bariatric surgery is known to increase the risk of kidney stones, particularly calcium oxalate stones. This is due to changes in the digestive system that lead to increased absorption of oxalate, a component of the most common type of kidney stone. 

Option A suggests that the risk can be minimized by restricting dietary calcium and oxalate. However, restricting dietary calcium can actually increase the risk of stones, as calcium in the gut binds to oxalate and prevents its absorption. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

Option B suggests that the risk of stones related to bariatric surgery is lower than the risk conferred by obesity. This is not accurate. While obesity is a risk factor for stones, the risk associated with bariatric surgery is higher due to the changes in the digestive system that increase oxalate absorption.

Option D suggests that the risk of stones is the same in all types of bariatric surgery. This is not accurate. The risk varies depending on the type of surgery, with procedures that bypass the duodenum and jejunum, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, associated with a higher risk.

Option C suggests that the risk conferred by bariatric surgery can be minimized by restricting dietary fat, increasing dietary calcium or taking a calcium supplement with meals, and maintaining high urinary volume of > B.5 L/d. This is the most accurate statement. Restricting dietary fat can reduce the amount of fat in the gut, which can bind to calcium and prevent it from binding to oxalate. Increasing dietary calcium or taking a calcium supplement with meals can increase the amount of calcium available to bind to oxalate, reducing its absorption. Maintaining high urinary volume can help to dilute any oxalate that is absorbed, reducing the risk of stone formation.

Therefore, the answer is [C].
