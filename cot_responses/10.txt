## Answer
The patient's blood pressure is currently well-controlled, and she is not showing any signs of preeclampsia, such as proteinuria or severe hypertension. Therefore, there is no need to add another antihypertensive medication like methyldopa (option B) or hydrochlorothiazide (option D). Stopping labetalol (option C) could potentially lead to a dangerous increase in blood pressure. Implementing a 2-g sodium-restricted diet (option A) is not necessary as there is no evidence that sodium restriction improves pregnancy outcomes in women with chronic hypertension. Therefore, the most appropriate management is to continue with the current regimen (option E), which is controlling her blood pressure effectively without causing any adverse effects. Therefore, the answer is [E. Make no changes to the current regimen].
