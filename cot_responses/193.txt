## Answer
Firstly, it's important to note that masked hypertension is a condition where a person's blood pressure is normal in a clinical setting but high when measured at other times, like at home or work. This patient's 24-hour ambulatory BP is 145/98 mmHg, which is considered high, indicating that he may have masked hypertension. 

Option A suggests that long working hours have no relationship with hypertension. However, several studies have shown that long working hours can be a risk factor for hypertension, so this option can be ruled out.

Option B suggests that long working hours are associated with hypertension only if someone has a family history of hypertension. While family history can be a risk factor for hypertension, it's not the only factor. The patient in this case does not have a family history of hypertension, yet his blood pressure is high. Therefore, this option can be ruled out.

Option C suggests that long working hours are associated with hypertension only if someone leads a sedentary lifestyle. While a sedentary lifestyle can contribute to hypertension, it's not the only factor. The patient in this case leads a fairly active life, yet his blood pressure is high. Therefore, this option can be ruled out.

Option D suggests that long working hours are associated with both masked hypertension and sustained hypertension. This is consistent with the patient's condition and with research showing that long working hours can contribute to hypertension, regardless of other factors like family history or lifestyle.

Therefore, the answer is D. Assure him that long working hours are associated with both masked hypertension and sustained hypertension.
