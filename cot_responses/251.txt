## Answer
The patient's history and lab results provide several clues to the cause of her acute kidney injury (AKI). She has a history of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer and has been treated with cisplatin, pemetrexed, and nivolumab. Both cisplatin and pemetrexed can cause nephrotoxicity, but the timing of her AKI suggests another cause. Her baseline serum creatinine was normal after her last cycle of cisplatin and pemetrexed, and her AKI developed after she started nivolumab. Nivolumab is a checkpoint inhibitor that can cause immune-related adverse effects, including acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). The patient's urinalysis results, which show a high number of white blood cells, are consistent with AIN. Prerenal causes of AKI, such as volume depletion, are less likely because the patient does not have symptoms of volume depletion, such as lightheadedness or dizziness, and her urinary sodium is not low. Therefore, the answer is D. Immunotherapy related to acute interstitial nephritis.
