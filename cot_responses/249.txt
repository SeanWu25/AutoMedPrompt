## Answer
The patient in question is critically ill with severe COVID-19, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and is currently anuric, indicating severe kidney failure. In such a scenario, renal replacement therapy is necessary. 

Option A suggests that intermittent hemodialysis is associated with worse renal outcomes compared to continuous techniques. However, studies have shown that both intermittent and continuous renal replacement therapies have similar outcomes in terms of mortality and renal recovery.

Option B suggests that emergency start of peritoneal dialysis may associate with higher mortality, but could still be useful when limited dialytic resources are available. While this is true, peritoneal dialysis is typically not the first choice for acute kidney injury in critically ill patients due to the risk of infection and other complications.

Option C suggests that citrate anticoagulation is more efficient than any form of heparin therapy in prolonging circuit half-life. This is generally true. Citrate anticoagulation is often used in continuous renal replacement therapy because it reduces the risk of bleeding and can prolong filter life.

Option D suggests that circuit clotting rate may be higher than 30% even when anticoagulation is started. This is also true. Despite anticoagulation, clotting can still occur in the dialysis circuit, which can lead to interruptions in treatment.

Given the patient's condition and the information provided, the most accurate statement would be option C. Citrate anticoagulation is often used in continuous renal replacement therapy in critically ill patients because it reduces the risk of bleeding and can prolong filter life.

Therefore, the answer is [C].
