## Answer
The patient's clinical findings indicate isolated microscopic hematuria, which is defined as three or more red blood cells per high-power field on microscopic examination of urinary sediment from two of three properly collected urinalysis specimens. The most common causes of isolated microscopic hematuria are urinary tract infection, urinary stones, and urinary tract malignancy. However, this patient's evaluation, including urine culture and renal ultrasound, is negative for these conditions. 

In the absence of proteinuria, hypertension, or signs of kidney disease, isolated microscopic hematuria does not increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, preterm labor, or small for gestational age baby. Therefore, the patient should be reassured that her isolated microscopic hematuria is unlikely to impact her pregnancy.

Therefore, the answer is [D. It does not increase the risk for a small gestation baby].
