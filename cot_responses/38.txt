## Answer
The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, leg edema, weight loss, abdominal pain, constipation, anorexia, and nausea, along with the physical examination findings of a firm abdomen and basilar crackles in both lung fields, suggest a problem with fluid overload. This is likely due to ultrafiltration failure, which is a common complication in patients on long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD). 

Ultrafiltration failure can be caused by several factors, including a peritoneal dialysate leak, increased lymphatic absorption, encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis, or a high transport membrane. 

A peritoneal dialysate leak (Option A) would typically present with symptoms of fluid overload, but the patient's rapid 2-L exchange showed no problem with inflow and return of clear effluent, making this less likely.

Increased lymphatic absorption (Option B) could also cause ultrafiltration failure, but this is usually associated with cloudy effluent, which this patient does not have.

A high transport membrane (Option D) is characterized by a high D/P creatinine and a low D/P glucose. However, this patient's D/P creatinine has been decreasing over the years and the D/P glucose has been increasing, indicating a low transport membrane, not a high one.

Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (Option C) is a rare but serious complication of long-term PD, characterized by progressive fibrosis and calcification of the peritoneum, leading to ultrafiltration failure. This condition can present with symptoms of abdominal pain, anorexia, weight loss, and constipation, all of which this patient has. The firm abdomen on physical examination is also suggestive of this condition. 

Therefore, the answer is [C. Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis].
