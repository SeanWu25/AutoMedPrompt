## Answer
When considering the best option for peritoneal dialysis (PD) access, it's important to consider the type of catheter that would provide the most effective and safe dialysis. Tenckhoff catheters are commonly used for PD and come in different configurations, including straight or coiled and single-cuff or double-cuff. 

Straight catheters are generally easier to insert but may migrate more easily than coiled catheters. Coiled catheters, on the other hand, are less likely to migrate but may be more difficult to insert. 

The number of cuffs on the catheter also plays a role in its effectiveness and safety. Single-cuff catheters have one cuff that is placed in the subcutaneous tissue to help anchor the catheter and prevent infection. Double-cuff catheters have an additional cuff that is placed deeper, in the preperitoneal fat. This provides additional anchoring and further reduces the risk of infection.

Given that this patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD) approaching end stage and has opted for home PD, it would be important to choose a catheter that minimizes the risk of complications such as migration and infection. 

Therefore, the answer is B. Straight double-cuff Tenchkoff catheter. This type of catheter would provide the necessary anchoring to prevent migration and the additional cuff to reduce the risk of infection, which is particularly important for a patient performing PD at home.
