## Answer
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) has several direct actions in the body, primarily aimed at increasing the concentration of calcium in the blood. 

Option A, increased intestinal absorption of calcium, is not a direct action of PTH. Instead, PTH indirectly increases intestinal absorption of calcium by stimulating the kidneys to convert vitamin D to its active form, calcitriol. Calcitriol then acts on the intestines to increase calcium absorption.

Option B, increased activity of 1α-hydroxylase, is a direct action of PTH. PTH stimulates the kidneys to increase the activity of 1α-hydroxylase, an enzyme that converts inactive vitamin D to its active form, calcitriol.

Option C, increased tubular reabsorption of calcium, is a direct action of PTH. PTH acts on the kidneys to increase the reabsorption of calcium in the renal tubules, thereby reducing the amount of calcium excreted in the urine.

Option D, increased bone resorption, is also a direct action of PTH. PTH acts on the bones to stimulate osteoclast activity, leading to increased bone resorption and release of calcium into the bloodstream.

Therefore, the answer is [A. Increased intestinal absorption of calcium].
