## Answer
The patient has CKD-5 with an eGFR of 19 ml/min, which indicates advanced chronic kidney disease. He is interested in kidney transplantation and has no significant comorbidities that would contraindicate this procedure. 

Option A suggests waiting until the patient's eGFR is less than 10 ml/min to refer him for transplantation evaluation. However, waiting until the patient's kidney function deteriorates further may not be beneficial. Early referral for transplantation evaluation allows for adequate time for patient education, evaluation, and potential placement on the transplant waiting list.

Option B suggests that the patient's benefits from transplantation are low due to his age. However, age alone is not a contraindication for kidney transplantation. The patient's overall health status, including the absence of significant comorbidities, is more important than age in determining suitability for transplantation.

Option C suggests referring the patient for transplantation evaluation only if he has a likely living donor option. However, the patient has expressed a desire not to pursue living donor kidney transplantation. Moreover, having a living donor is not a prerequisite for transplantation evaluation.

Option D suggests avoiding pre-emptive transplantation because elderly patients have a higher risk of death than of progression to dialysis. However, this statement is not universally true. The risk of death versus progression to dialysis depends on many factors, including the patient's overall health status and the severity of kidney disease.

Option E suggests referring the patient for transplantation evaluation now. This seems to be the most appropriate option. The patient has advanced kidney disease, is interested in transplantation, and has no significant comorbidities that would contraindicate this procedure. Early referral for transplantation evaluation would allow for adequate time for patient education, evaluation, and potential placement on the transplant waiting list.

Therefore, the answer is E. He should be referred for transplantation evaluation now.
