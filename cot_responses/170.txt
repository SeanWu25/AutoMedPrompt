## Answer
To answer this question, we need to consider the current evidence regarding the use of hypoglycemic agents in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).

Option A suggests that Dulaglutide is superior in reducing CKD progression and albuminuria compared with insulin glargine. While Dulaglutide has been shown to have beneficial effects on kidney outcomes, it's not definitively proven to be superior to insulin glargine.

Option B suggests that incretin-based therapies delay the progression of CKD. While some studies suggest potential renal benefits of incretin-based therapies, the evidence is not strong enough to make a definitive statement about their ability to delay CKD progression.

Option C suggests that only individuals with stage G4 CKD derive cardiovascular benefit from SGLT-2 inhibitors. This is not accurate as SGLT-2 inhibitors have been shown to provide cardiovascular benefits in patients with a range of CKD stages, not just stage G4.

Option D suggests that the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is dependent on the stage of CKD. This is accurate. Metformin is generally safe in patients with mild to moderate CKD, but the risk of lactic acidosis increases as kidney function declines, particularly in patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD.

Therefore, the answer is [D. The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is dependent on the stage of CKD].
