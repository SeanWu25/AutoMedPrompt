## Answer
To answer this question, we need to understand the capabilities of each imaging modality mentioned in the options.

A. Cationic ferritin-enhanced (CFE)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): This is a type of MRI that uses a contrast agent to enhance the visibility of certain structures. CFE-MRI has been used to visualize and quantify glomerular number, so this pairing is correct.

B. Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS): This is a type of ultrasound that can be performed at the bedside. It is used to assess many different conditions, but it is not typically used to directly visualize inflammation. Instead, it can show indirect signs of inflammation such as increased blood flow or swelling. Therefore, this pairing is incorrect.

C. Diffusion-weighted MRI: This is a type of MRI that measures the diffusion of water molecules within a tissue, which can be used to detect fibrosis. Therefore, this pairing is correct.

D. Blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) MRI: This is a type of MRI that measures the level of oxygen in the blood, which can be used to detect hypoxia in tissues, including the cortical tissue of the kidney. Therefore, this pairing is correct.

Therefore, the answer is B. Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS): inﬂammation.
