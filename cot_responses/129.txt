## Answer
The patient's history of recurrent nephrotic syndrome with complete remission after steroid therapy, as well as the recent upper respiratory infection, suggest that his current presentation is likely another episode of minimal change disease (MCD). MCD is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and is often associated with recent infections. It is characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, all of which are present in this patient. MCD is highly responsive to corticosteroids, which is consistent with the patient's past medical history. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to start empiric therapy with oral corticosteroids. A repeat kidney biopsy is not necessary at this point because the patient's presentation and history are highly suggestive of MCD. Cyclosporine is typically reserved for patients who are steroid-resistant or who have frequent relapses. Genetic studies for a podocytopathy are not indicated because there is no evidence to suggest a genetic cause for the patient's nephrotic syndrome.
Therefore, the answer is D. Start empiric therapy with oral corticosteroids.
