## Answer
The patient's history and lab results provide important clues to the cause of her hypokalemia. She has no history of vomiting, diarrhea, or use of over-the-counter medications or herbal supplements, which rules out options A, C, and D. Her lab results show a low plasma potassium level, high plasma bicarbonate level, and high urine pH, which are consistent with metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis can be caused by a loss of acid (through vomiting or diuretic use) or a gain of bicarbonate (through ingestion or intravenous administration). However, the patient's history rules out these causes. Another cause of metabolic alkalosis is hypokalemia, which can result from a shift of potassium from the extracellular to the intracellular space. This can occur in response to alkalosis itself or due to a deficiency of magnesium, which is required for normal potassium balance. Therefore, the answer is B. Magnesium deficiency.
