## Answer
First, let's analyze each option:

A. HIV positive patients have a higher risk of graft loss than HIV2 recipients: This statement is not clear as it compares HIV positive patients with HIV2 recipients, which seems to be a typographical error. 

B. HIV positive kidney transplant recipients have the same risk of mortality as HIV2 recipients: Again, this statement seems to have a typographical error, comparing HIV positive patients with HIV2 recipients. 

C. Concurrent use of protease inhibitors with tacrolimus poses an increased risk of nephrotoxicity without affecting the risk of graft failure: This statement is true. Protease inhibitors, which are used in the treatment of HIV, can interact with tacrolimus, a medication used to prevent organ rejection after a transplant. This interaction can increase the levels of tacrolimus in the body, leading to nephrotoxicity. However, this does not necessarily increase the risk of graft failure.

D. The risk of opportunistic infections is higher in HIV positive kidney transplant recipients compared with HIV negative recipients: This statement is also true. HIV positive individuals have a compromised immune system, which makes them more susceptible to opportunistic infections, even when their HIV is well controlled. This risk is further increased after a transplant, as patients are given medications to suppress their immune system and prevent organ rejection.

E. Concurrent HCV positivity will have no additional impact on outcome after transplantation: This statement is false. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can negatively impact the outcomes after transplantation, including increased risk of liver disease and graft loss.

Therefore, the answer is D. The risk of opportunistic infections is higher in HIV positive kidney transplant recipients compared with HIV negative recipients.
