## Answer
When considering the need for disinfection of the internal hydraulic components of a hemodialysis machine, we need to think about situations where there is a risk of contamination that could potentially harm the next patient. 

Option A, an air leak, would not necessarily require disinfection as air does not typically carry pathogens that could contaminate the machine.

Option C and D, completion of hemodialysis in a patient with hepatitis C virus infection and HIV infection respectively, would not necessarily require disinfection of the internal components of the machine. This is because the blood of the patient does not come into contact with the internal hydraulic components of the machine during the dialysis process. The blood is contained within the dialyzer and tubing, and does not interact with the machine's internal components.

Option B, a blood leak due to a ruptured dialyzer membrane, would require disinfection. This is because a ruptured membrane could allow the patient's blood to come into contact with the internal components of the machine, potentially contaminating it with any pathogens present in the blood.

Therefore, the answer is B. A blood leak due to a ruptured dialyzer membrane.
