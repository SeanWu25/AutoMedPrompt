## Answer
The patient's history of injecting paraffin oil into his muscles, followed by the development of local infection and the presence of warm, dense nodules in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, suggests a foreign body reaction. This reaction often leads to the formation of granulomas, which are collections of immune cells that form in response to substances that the body is unable to break down. Giant cell granulomas are a specific type of granuloma that contain multinucleated giant cells, and they can form in response to foreign bodies such as paraffin oil. The other options are less likely: lymphomatous infiltration would be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and night sweats; necrotizing fasciitis would cause severe pain and systemic illness; tumoral calcinosis typically occurs in patients with hyperphosphatemia, which this patient does not have; and scleroderma is a systemic autoimmune disease that would cause a variety of other symptoms, such as Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, and pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, the answer is C. Giant cell granuloma formation.
