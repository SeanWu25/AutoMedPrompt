## Answer
The patient's blood pressure is 136/86 mmHg, which is classified as stage 1 hypertension according to the American Heart Association. Stage 1 hypertension is defined as a systolic blood pressure of 130-139 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure of 80-89 mmHg. The patient also has a high total cholesterol level and a high LDL level, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However, the patient does not have any other risk factors such as diabetes or kidney disease. 

The American Heart Association recommends lifestyle modifications for all patients with hypertension, regardless of the stage. These modifications include a healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss if overweight, limiting alcohol intake, and quitting smoking. 

The decision to start antihypertensive medication in patients with stage 1 hypertension depends on the patient's risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in the next 10 years. If the patient's 10-year ASCVD risk is less than 10%, lifestyle modifications alone are recommended. If the patient's 10-year ASCVD risk is 10% or higher, both lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medication are recommended.

In this case, the patient's 10-year ASCVD risk is not provided. Therefore, the patient should be instructed on lifestyle modifications, and the decision on medication should be based on the assessment of his 10-year ASCVD risk.

Therefore, the answer is C. He should be instructed on lifestyle modiÔ¨Åcation with the decision on medication dependent on assessment of 10-year cardiovascular disease event risk.
