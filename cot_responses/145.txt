## Answer
The patient experienced acute kidney injury (AKI) during her hospital stay, as evidenced by the rise in serum creatinine and transient oliguria. Even though her kidney function returned to baseline, research has shown that patients who experience AKI are at a higher risk for readmission and other adverse outcomes, regardless of whether their kidney function returns to baseline. This is because AKI can cause lasting damage to the kidneys, which can lead to chronic kidney disease and other complications. The stage of AKI or the presence of transient oliguria does not necessarily predict the risk of readmission. Therefore, the answer is B. Although she experienced transient azotemia that returned to baseline within 3 days, she still is at a higher risk for readmission than are patients without AKI.
