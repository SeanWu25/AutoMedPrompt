## Answer
The question is asking for the echocardiogram finding that is associated with a significant decline in eGFR (glomerular filtration rate) or ESRD (end-stage renal disease). 

Option A, increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure, is often associated with conditions like pulmonary hypertension, but it's not directly linked to a decline in kidney function or ESRD.

Option B, a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50%, is within the normal range (55-70%) and would not typically be associated with a decline in kidney function or ESRD.

Option D, increased relative wall thickness, is a sign of left ventricular hypertrophy, which is common in patients with hypertension or heart disease, but it's not directly linked to a decline in kidney function or ESRD.

Option C, increased left ventricular mass index, is a sign of left ventricular hypertrophy, which is a common finding in patients with chronic kidney disease. This is because the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the body, leading to an increase in the size of the heart muscle. This can lead to a decline in kidney function and eventually ESRD.

Therefore, the answer is [C. Increased left ventricular mass index].
