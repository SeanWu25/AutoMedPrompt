## Answer
The patient has steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, which is initially responsive to corticosteroids but relapses when the dose is reduced. He has also shown resistance to cyclophosphamide and levamisole, and has developed side effects from prolonged steroid use. Therefore, a different treatment approach is needed. 

Option A, repeat kidney biopsy, is not necessary as the diagnosis is already clear and the problem is with treatment resistance, not diagnosis. 

Option B, mycophenolate mofetil plus steroids, could be a potential option, but mycophenolate mofetil is generally considered less effective than calcineurin inhibitors (like tacrolimus) for steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome.

Option C, tacrolimus plus steroids, is a good choice as tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in treating steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. 

Option D, retreat with oral cyclophosphamide and steroids, is not a good choice as the patient has already shown resistance to cyclophosphamide.

Option E, rituximab, is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD20 on B cells and is used in refractory cases of nephrotic syndrome. However, it is usually considered after calcineurin inhibitors have been tried.

Therefore, the answer is C. Tacrolimus plus steroids.
