## Answer
Low nephron endowment refers to a condition where there is a lower than normal number of nephrons in the kidney. Nephrons are the functional units of the kidney responsible for filtering blood and producing urine. 

Option A, increased glomerular density, would suggest a higher number of nephrons, not a lower one, so this option can be ruled out.

Option B, glomerular hypertrophy, refers to an enlargement of the glomeruli. This can occur as a compensatory mechanism when there is a reduced number of functioning nephrons, as the remaining nephrons must work harder to filter the blood. Therefore, this could be a sign of low nephron endowment.

Option C, global glomerulosclerosis, refers to a condition where there is scarring (sclerosis) of the glomeruli. While this can occur in conditions that damage the kidneys, it is not specifically associated with low nephron endowment.

Option D, arteriolonephrosclerosis, refers to a condition where there is hardening of the small arteries and arterioles in the kidney. This is typically associated with conditions like hypertension and is not specifically associated with low nephron endowment.

Therefore, the answer is B. Glomerular hypertrophy.
