## Answer
The patient's history of squamous cell skin cancer and tubular adenomatous polyp are important considerations in his evaluation for kidney transplantation. However, the skin cancer was successfully resected with clear margins a year ago and the polyp was removed two years ago. Therefore, these conditions are unlikely to pose a significant risk for malignancy after transplant. 

Option A suggests an additional 1-year waiting time based on the prior skin cancer history. However, the skin cancer was successfully treated and there is no current evidence of disease. Therefore, there is no need for additional waiting time.

Option B suggests a repeat colonoscopy before proceeding with the transplant. However, the patient's last colonoscopy was only two years ago and the adenomatous polyp was successfully removed. Current guidelines recommend a repeat colonoscopy 5-10 years after the removal of a single small tubular adenoma. Therefore, a repeat colonoscopy is not necessary at this time.

Option C suggests checking a screening serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. However, the patient does not have any symptoms suggestive of prostate cancer and there is no family history of the disease. Therefore, routine PSA screening is not recommended in this case.

Option D suggests referring the patient for screening cystoscopy. However, the patient does not have any symptoms suggestive of bladder cancer and he has not been exposed to known risk factors for the disease (e.g., working in aluminum smelting, rubber manufacture, or leather industries). Therefore, routine cystoscopy is not recommended in this case.

Therefore, the answer is [None of the above].
