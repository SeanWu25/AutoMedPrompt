## Answer
The patient's presentation is consistent with membranous nephropathy, a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. The disease is characterized by subepithelial immune complex deposits leading to thickening of the glomerular basement membrane. The majority of cases are primary (idiopathic) and are associated with antibodies to the M-type phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) located on podocytes. However, this patient's negative serum anti-PLA2R antibody and lack of enhanced PLA2R antigen expression in the glomeruli suggest a secondary cause of membranous nephropathy. Secondary causes include autoimmune diseases, infections (eg, hepatitis B, hepatitis C), malignancies, and certain medications. Given the negative hepatitis serologies, the next step in evaluation should be to assess for autoimmune diseases and malignancies. 

Option A, Serum C3 and C4, is not the best choice because low complement levels are more commonly seen in diseases with immune complex deposition in the mesangium or subendothelium (eg, lupus nephritis, postinfectious glomerulonephritis), which is not the case here.

Option B, Anti–nuclear antibody and anti–double stranded DNA antibody, could be considered to evaluate for systemic lupus erythematosus, but it is not the best choice because lupus nephritis typically presents with active urine sediment (eg, hematuria, cellular casts), low complement levels, and mesangial and/or subendothelial immune complex deposits, none of which are present in this patient.

Option C, Anti–thrombospondin 7A staining of the renal biopsy specimen, is the best choice. Thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A) is a target antigen in a small subset of patients with primary membranous nephropathy. THSD7A-associated membranous nephropathy is more common in women and is associated with malignancy in up to 20% of cases. Therefore, patients with positive staining should undergo age- and sex-appropriate cancer screening.

Option D, Serum free light chains, is not the best choice because light chain deposition disease typically presents with nodular glomerulosclerosis on kidney biopsy, not membranous nephropathy.

Therefore, the answer is C. Anti–thrombospondin 7A staining of the renal biopsy specimen
