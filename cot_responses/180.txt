## Answer
The patient's history of skin cancer is relevant to her outcomes after kidney transplantation. This is because patients who have had a history of skin cancer prior to transplantation are at an increased risk of developing skin cancer again after transplantation. This is due to the immunosuppressive therapy that is required after transplantation, which can increase the risk of cancer development. However, this does not necessarily mean that the patient's graft will fail, or that she will develop a solid organ malignancy or a posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder. Therefore, the answer is A. Pretransplantation skin cancer has no impact on the risk of graft failure.
