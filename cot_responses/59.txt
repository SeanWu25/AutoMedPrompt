## Answer
Norepinephrine and vasopressin are both used as vasopressors to increase blood pressure in patients with septic shock. Norepinephrine works by stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors, which leads to vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. Vasopressin, on the other hand, works by stimulating vasopressin receptors, which also leads to vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure. However, vasopressin has a more direct effect on the kidneys, and its use has been associated with a lower risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) and renal replacement therapy (RRT) compared to norepinephrine. Therefore, the use of norepinephrine in this patient would most likely be associated with an increased risk of AKI (Option A) and RRT (Option C). On the other hand, there is no strong evidence to suggest that the use of norepinephrine would lead to a decreased number of AKI-free days (Option B) or a decreased mortality risk (Option D). Therefore, the answer is A. Increased risk of AKI.
