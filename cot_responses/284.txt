## Answer
The patient's kidney biopsy showing normal appearance on light microscopy but diffuse foot process effacement on electron microscopy is indicative of minimal change disease (MCD). MCD is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome, characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, as seen in this patient.

A. In patients with contraindication to glucocorticoids, calcineurin inhibitors would be an appropriate ﬁrst line of therapy - This is true. Calcineurin inhibitors like cyclosporine and tacrolimus are often used as second-line therapy in patients who are steroid-resistant or have contraindications to steroids.

B. Rituximab has been shown to be beneﬁcial in those who fail to respond to steroid or calcineurin inhibitor therapy - This is also true. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against CD20, is used in patients with MCD who are resistant to or dependent on steroids and calcineurin inhibitors.

C. Calcineurin inhibitor is associated with a lower rate of remission compared with corticosteroids - This is not true. Calcineurin inhibitors have been shown to induce remission in a significant proportion of patients with MCD, although they are generally considered second-line therapy after corticosteroids.

D. When compared with a tacrolimus-based treatment protocol, treatment with rituximab was associated with a greater cumulative steroid dose - This is not necessarily true. The use of rituximab may actually reduce the need for steroids in some patients with MCD.

Given the question asks for the MOST correct answer, and all options except C are generally correct, the best answer would be the one that is applicable to the widest range of patients with MCD. This would be option B, as rituximab can be used in patients who fail to respond to both first-line (steroids) and second-line (calcineurin inhibitors) therapies.

Therefore, the answer is [B].
