## Answer
The patient in the scenario has IgA nephropathy, a kidney disease that can lead to end-stage renal disease. The MEST score is a histologic classification system for IgA nephropathy, and T0 indicates no tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis. The patient's proteinuria has increased despite the addition of dapagliflozin, a medication used to manage diabetes and reduce the risk of kidney disease progression.

Option A is incorrect. The 2021 KDIGO guidelines do not recommend glucocorticoids for all patients with IgA nephropathy who have high-grade proteinuria after a trial of nonimmunosuppressive therapy. The use of glucocorticoids is based on individual patient characteristics, including the risk of progression and the potential for adverse effects.

Option B is also incorrect. While rituximab, a monoclonal antibody, has been used in some cases of IgA nephropathy, it is not recommended as a first-line treatment over glucocorticoids. The evidence for its effectiveness in reducing proteinuria in IgA nephropathy is not robust.

Option C is incorrect as well. Glucocorticoids have been shown in multiple studies to be effective in reducing proteinuria and preventing a decline in GFR in patients with IgA nephropathy.

Option D is the most accurate statement. Glucocorticoids have been shown to reduce the risk of progression of kidney disease in patients with IgA nephropathy. However, they are associated with an increased risk of adverse events, including infections, hyperglycemia, and osteoporosis. This risk is attenuated, but still present, at lower doses.

Therefore, the answer is [D. Glucocorticoids reduce the risk of progression of kidney disease but are associated with an increased risk of adverse events; this risk is markedly attenuated, although still present, at lower doses (0.4 mg/kg per day)].
