## Answer
First, let's consider each option individually. 

Option A suggests that antihypertensives may be less effective in the presence of periodontitis. This is plausible as periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease and inflammation can contribute to hypertension. 

Option B states that severe periodontitis is associated with a doubling of incidence of hypertension. While periodontitis and hypertension are both common conditions, the exact relationship between the two is not fully understood. However, some studies have suggested a link between periodontitis and hypertension, possibly due to the systemic inflammation caused by periodontitis.

Option C suggests that periodontitis does not predict BP control. This seems unlikely as periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease and inflammation can contribute to hypertension. 

Option D states that treating the patient’s periodontitis will not alter his BP control. This is also unlikely as treating periodontitis could potentially reduce systemic inflammation and therefore help to control hypertension.

Given these considerations, option A seems the most plausible. Recent studies have suggested that periodontitis can interfere with the effectiveness of antihypertensive medications, possibly due to the systemic inflammation caused by periodontitis. Therefore, the answer is [A. Antihypertensives may be less eﬀective in the presence of periodontitis].
