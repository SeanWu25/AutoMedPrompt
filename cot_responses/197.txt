## Answer
The patient's presentation and kidney biopsy findings are consistent with minimal change disease (MCD), a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and adults. MCD is characterized by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema, with normal-appearing glomeruli on light microscopy and foot process effacement on electron microscopy.

Let's evaluate each option:

A. Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor that is sometimes used in the treatment of MCD, particularly in patients who are steroid-resistant or steroid-dependent. However, corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for MCD, and while tacrolimus may induce remission in some patients, it has not been shown to have similar rates of remission and relapse when compared with corticosteroids.

B. Alternate-day corticosteroid therapy is not typically used in the treatment of MCD. Daily corticosteroid dosing is the standard approach, and there is no evidence to suggest that alternate-day dosing is associated with reduced rates of remission.

C. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against CD20, has been shown to be beneficial in patients with MCD who fail to respond to steroid or calcineurin inhibitor therapy. This is because it depletes B cells, which are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of MCD.

D. Rituximab is typically used in patients who are steroid-resistant or steroid-dependent, and it may allow for a reduction in the cumulative steroid dose. There is no evidence to suggest that treatment with rituximab is associated with a greater cumulative steroid dose when compared with a tacrolimus-based treatment protocol.

Therefore, the answer is C. Rituximab has been shown to be beneficial in children who fail to respond to steroid or calcineurin inhibitor therapy.
