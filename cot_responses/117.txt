## Answer
Etelcalcetide is a calcimimetic agent that is used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are on hemodialysis. It works by binding to and activating the calcium-sensing receptor on the parathyroid gland, which inhibits PTH secretion. This is similar to the mechanism of action of cinacalcet, another calcimimetic agent. However, etelcalcetide is administered intravenously, which can reduce gastrointestinal side effects compared to oral cinacalcet. Therefore, it is less likely to cause nausea, a common side effect of cinacalcet. However, both etelcalcetide and cinacalcet can cause hypocalcemia, so option A is not correct. The need to adjust calcium concentration in the dialysate would not be decreased with etelcalcetide compared to cinacalcet, so option C is not correct. Etelcalcetide has been shown to be non-inferior to cinacalcet in lowering PTH concentrations, so option D is correct. There is currently no evidence to suggest that etelcalcetide reduces the risk for cardiovascular events, including sudden cardiac death, so option E is not correct. 

Therefore, the answer is [D. It is not inferior to cinacalcet in lowering PTH concentrations]
