## Answer
The patient's blood pressure is currently well controlled with medication, and he has normal kidney function. This suggests that the renal artery stenosis is not significantly affecting his renal function or blood pressure control. Therefore, invasive procedures such as renal arteriography or percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty and stent placement are not necessary at this stage. Duplex ultrasonography is also not needed as we already have a diagnosis from the CT angiography. The best approach would be to continue with the current treatment, monitor the patient's blood pressure and renal function, and only consider more invasive procedures if his condition worsens. Therefore, the answer is [D. Maintain current treatment].
