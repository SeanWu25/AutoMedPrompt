## Answer
Empagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. It works by blocking the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, promoting its excretion in the urine, and thus lowering blood glucose levels. This class of drugs has been shown to have several benefits beyond glycemic control. They can promote weight loss, reduce blood pressure, and slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. 

However, the options provided are asking for additional benefits beyond these. 

Option A suggests a reduced risk of death from renal disease. While SGLT2 inhibitors can slow the progression of kidney disease, there is not enough evidence to suggest that they can reduce the risk of death from renal disease specifically.

Option B suggests a reduced risk of cardiovascular death. This is indeed a benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial showed that empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease.

Option C suggests a reduction in LDL cholesterol. While SGLT2 inhibitors can have some effect on lipid levels, they do not significantly reduce LDL cholesterol.

Option D suggests a decreased risk of ketoacidosis. This is incorrect as SGLT2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin, have actually been associated with an increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Therefore, the answer is B. A reduced risk of cardiovascular death.
