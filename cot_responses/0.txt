## Answer
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that adults aged 18 years or older have their blood pressure measured every year. This recommendation is based on the evidence that early detection and treatment of high blood pressure can prevent cardiovascular disease. The patient's blood pressure is currently 128/80 mmHg, which is within the normal range but on the higher end. Given her age, race, and BMI, she is at a higher risk for developing hypertension. Therefore, it would be prudent to monitor her blood pressure annually to detect any changes early and initiate treatment if necessary. 
Therefore, the answer is B. In 1 year.
