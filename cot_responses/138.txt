## Answer
A restrictive fluid strategy is designed to minimize fluid overload, which can lead to complications such as pulmonary edema, heart failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). This strategy is particularly important in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), like the patient in the scenario, who are at increased risk of fluid overload due to their impaired kidney function. 

Option A suggests that a restrictive fluid strategy decreases the risk of surgical site infections. However, there is no direct correlation between fluid management strategy and the risk of surgical site infections. 

Option B suggests that a restrictive fluid strategy increases the risk of AKI requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). This is not accurate. In fact, a restrictive fluid strategy is designed to prevent AKI by avoiding fluid overload, which can cause kidney injury.

Option C suggests that a restrictive fluid strategy increases the length of stay in the intensive care unit. This is not necessarily true. The length of stay in the ICU is influenced by many factors, including the patient's overall health, the severity of their illness, and their response to treatment. A restrictive fluid strategy could potentially decrease the length of stay in the ICU by preventing complications related to fluid overload.

Option D suggests that a restrictive fluid strategy increases the risk of mortality at 1 year. This is not necessarily true. While fluid management is an important aspect of patient care, it is only one of many factors that can influence a patient's long-term prognosis. 

Therefore, the answer is [A. A decreased risk of surgical site infections].
