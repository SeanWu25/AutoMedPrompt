## Answer
The question is asking about the factor that is most likely to increase the rate of referral for transplantation within 1 year of starting dialysis for this woman. 

Option A, the absence of pre-ESRD nephrology care, is unlikely to increase the rate of referral for transplantation. In fact, it might delay the process because the patient might not be well-prepared for the transplant evaluation process.

Option B, dialysis at a non-profit dialysis facility, could potentially increase the rate of referral for transplantation. Non-profit dialysis facilities are often associated with higher rates of transplantation referrals compared to for-profit facilities. This is because non-profit facilities are more likely to prioritize patient care over profit.

Option C, the proportion of patients treated at her center who are below the poverty level, is unlikely to increase the rate of referral for transplantation. In fact, lower socioeconomic status is often associated with lower rates of transplantation referrals due to various barriers such as lack of access to healthcare, lack of knowledge about transplantation, and financial constraints.

Option D, her insurance status, could potentially increase the rate of referral for transplantation. Patients with insurance are more likely to be referred for transplantation because they have the financial means to cover the cost of the procedure.

Among these options, the most influential factor is likely to be her insurance status. Therefore, the answer is D. Her insurance status.
