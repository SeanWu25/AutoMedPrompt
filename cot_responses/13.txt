## Answer
The patient has a history of preeclampsia and is currently pregnant with chronic hypertension, which are both risk factors for developing preeclampsia again. The most effective intervention to reduce the risk of preeclampsia in high-risk women, according to current guidelines, is the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg daily) initiated from the late first trimester. 

Supplemental vitamins C and E have not been shown to reduce the risk of preeclampsia. Weight loss during pregnancy is not recommended as it could potentially harm the fetus. Calcium supplementation is recommended for women with low dietary calcium intake, but this patient is already on a well-balanced diet, so it's unlikely to be beneficial in this case.

Therefore, the answer is [C. Aspirin at 81 mg daily].
