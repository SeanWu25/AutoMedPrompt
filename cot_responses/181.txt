## Answer
The treatment of Hepatitis C (HCV) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are candidates for kidney transplantation has evolved significantly with the advent of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). These agents have high efficacy and a favorable side effect profile, even in patients with advanced kidney disease. 

Option A suggests treating HCV before transplantation to minimize the risk of liver failure. However, the patient has no evidence of cirrhosis, which means she is not at immediate risk of liver failure. 

Option B suggests deferring treatment until after transplantation of a hepatitis C positive graft to reduce waiting time. However, this approach could potentially expose the patient to the risks of HCV infection post-transplantation, including accelerated progression of liver disease and increased mortality.

Option C suggests treating HCV before transplantation to avoid the risk of coinfection with a different strain of the virus that may pose the risk of drug resistance. While this is a valid concern, it is not the primary reason for treating HCV before transplantation.

Option D suggests treating HCV before transplantation to minimize the risk of rejection. However, there is no direct correlation between HCV treatment and risk of organ rejection.

Option E states that regardless of whether HCV is treated before or after transplantation, the patient is at risk of anemia due to the requirement for ribavirin therapy. This is true as ribavirin, which is often used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of HCV, can cause hemolytic anemia. 

Therefore, the answer is [E].
