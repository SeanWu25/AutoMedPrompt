## Answer
The patient's blood pressure readings from the 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring study are within the normal range. This suggests that the patient may have "white coat hypertension," where blood pressure readings are high in a clinical setting but normal at home or during daily activities. This can be due to anxiety or stress during medical appointments. The patient's current medication regimen seems to be controlling his blood pressure adequately outside of the clinical setting. Therefore, there is no need to add another medication or increase the dose of the current medications, which could potentially lead to hypotension or other side effects. The patient's serum potassium and creatinine levels are also within the normal range, indicating that his current medications are not causing any significant renal side effects. The urine albumin/creatinine ratio is slightly elevated, which could be a sign of early kidney disease, but it's not high enough to warrant a change in medication at this time. 

Therefore, the answer is [A. No change in management].
