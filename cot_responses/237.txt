## Answer
To answer this question, we need to understand the effects of metabolic acidosis in CKD and the role of NaHCO3 treatment. 

Option A suggests that NaHCO3 treatment for metabolic acidosis does not increase the requirement for antihypertensive or diuretic agents. This is not necessarily true as NaHCO3 can cause fluid retention, which may necessitate the use of diuretics. 

Option B suggests that increased ammoniagenesis resulting from acidosis leads to increases in endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels. This is true as acidosis can stimulate the production of ammonia in the kidneys, which can lead to increased ET-1 levels. However, this does not directly answer the question about the necessity of NaHCO3 treatment.

Option C suggests that in renal transplant recipients, metabolic acidosis has been associated with increased risk of graft failure, but not cardiovascular events. This is not directly relevant to the question as the patient has not had a renal transplant.

Option D suggests that alkali therapy has been shown to reduce urine ET-1 and aldosterone levels. This is true and relevant to the question. Alkali therapy, such as with NaHCO3, can help to correct metabolic acidosis, which can reduce the levels of ET-1 and aldosterone. This can help to slow the progression of CKD and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

Therefore, the answer is [D. Alkali therapy has been shown to reduce urine ET-1 and aldosterone levels].
