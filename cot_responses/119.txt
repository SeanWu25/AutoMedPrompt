## Answer
Hemodiafiltration (HDF) is a type of renal replacement therapy that combines diffusive and convective solute removal, which is more efficient in removing larger solutes such as β-2 microglobulin compared to conventional hemodialysis (HD). Therefore, HDF provides superior β-2 microglobulin clearance. While some studies suggest that HDF may improve patient-reported posttreatment recovery times, reduce the frequency of myocardial stunning, and be associated with improved survival, these findings are not consistent across all studies and therefore cannot be definitively stated. The risk of bacteremia is not necessarily increased with HDF compared to conventional HD. 

Therefore, the answer is B. HDF provides superior β-2 microglobulin clearance.
