## Answer
The process of hemodialysis involves the removal of waste products such as creatinine and urea, as well as free water from the blood when the kidneys are in a state of renal failure. Phosphate is one of the substances that is removed during this process. 

Option A suggests that 80% of phosphate removal occurs within the first hour of treatment. However, this is not accurate. Phosphate removal during hemodialysis is not front-loaded in the first hour but occurs throughout the entire duration of the dialysis session.

Option B suggests that intracellular phosphate concentrations are reduced by hemodialysis. This is also not accurate. Hemodialysis primarily removes substances from the blood, not from inside the cells.

Option C suggests that serum phosphate generally returns to predialysis concentrations within 12 hours of therapy. This is not entirely accurate. While it is true that serum phosphate levels can rise after dialysis, it is not typically to predialysis levels within such a short time frame.

Option D suggests that the length of hemodialysis treatment has little impact on the total amount of phosphate removal. This is incorrect. The duration of dialysis is directly related to the amount of phosphate removal. The longer the dialysis session, the more phosphate is removed.

Therefore, the answer is [A. Nearly 80% of phosphate removal by hemodialysis occurs within the first hour of treatment.]
