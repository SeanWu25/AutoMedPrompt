## Answer
The patient in the scenario has stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is showing signs of uremia, which indicates the need for renal replacement therapy. She is interested in peritoneal dialysis (PD) but is concerned about the time required for the catheter to heal. Urgent-start PD is a viable option in this case.

Option A suggests that abdominal wall complications can be reduced to less than 10% by initiating PD with low dwell volumes with gradual titration over the first month of therapy. This is a reasonable statement as starting with low dwell volumes can help reduce the risk of complications such as leaks and hernias.

Option B states that pericatheter leak and subcutaneous leak are the most common mechanical complications of urgent-start PD. This is also true as these complications are common in the early period after catheter insertion, especially when PD is initiated urgently.

Option C suggests that urgent-start PD should always be initiated as intermittent peritoneal dialysis rather than automated peritoneal dialysis to avoid catheter dysfunction. This is not necessarily true as the choice between intermittent and automated PD depends on various factors including patient preference, lifestyle, and clinical condition.

Option D states that transfer to hemodialysis (HD) within 1 year occurs in over 30% of patients treated with urgent-start PD. This is not necessarily true as the rate of transfer to HD can vary widely depending on individual patient factors and the quality of PD care.

Given these considerations, the most accurate and relevant information to provide to the patient in this scenario is that starting with low dwell volumes can help reduce the risk of complications, and that pericatheter and subcutaneous leaks are common complications of urgent-start PD.

Therefore, the answer is [A, B].
