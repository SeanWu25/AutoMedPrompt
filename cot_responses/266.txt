## Answer
The question is asking about the correct approach when considering treating blood pressure to target levels. 

Option A suggests that both home and clinical BP readings should be used to guide treatment. This is true as both home and clinic readings provide valuable information about a patient's blood pressure control. Home readings can provide a more comprehensive picture of the patient's blood pressure throughout the day, while clinic readings can help identify white coat hypertension.

Option B suggests that there is a good correlation between blood pressures obtained in a usual clinical visit versus those measured using a standardized measurement protocol. This is not necessarily true. Blood pressure readings can vary greatly depending on the circumstances under which they are taken, including the patient's stress levels, recent caffeine intake, and other factors.

Option C suggests that implementing standardized blood pressure measurements in an outpatient nephrology clinic would not require any significant changes to typical workflow. This is not necessarily true. Implementing a new protocol can often require changes to workflow, including additional training for staff and potentially longer appointment times.

Option D suggests that patients should void urine before having their blood pressures measured. This is true. A full bladder can artificially elevate blood pressure readings, so it is recommended that patients void before measurements are taken.

Therefore, the answer is [A, D].
