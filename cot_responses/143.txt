## Answer
The Prevention of Serious Adverse Events Following Angiography (PRESERVE) trial was a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy of intravenous isotonic bicarbonate and oral acetylcysteine in preventing major adverse kidney events within 90 days after angiography. The trial found that neither of these interventions was superior to intravenous isotonic saline and placebo in preventing these outcomes. Therefore, the use of N-acetylcysteine or isotonic bicarbonate is not recommended for prophylaxis against contrast-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing angiography. This patient, who has stage G3b:A3 CKD, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, is at high risk for contrast-induced nephropathy. However, based on the findings of the PRESERVE trial, neither N-acetylcysteine nor isotonic bicarbonate would be more likely to reduce his risk of dialysis-requiring AKI after radiocontrast exposure than placebo or isotonic saline. Therefore, the answer is C. Neither N-acetylcysteine compared with placebo nor isotonic bicarbonate therapy compared with saline solution is more likely to reduce the risk of dialysis-requiring AKI after radiocontrast exposure.
