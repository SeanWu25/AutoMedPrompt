## Answer
The patient's creatinine level has increased from 0.8 mg/dl to 1.5 mg/dl within a month, indicating a decline in kidney function. Bevacizumab, a VEGF inhibitor, can cause kidney damage, but it was discontinued a month ago, and the patient's urinalysis is bland, which makes bevacizumab toxicity less likely (ruling out option A). Denosumab, a medication used for bone metastases, does not typically cause kidney damage, so stopping it (option B) would not likely improve the patient's kidney function. Abemaciclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, can cause an increase in creatinine levels by inhibiting tubular secretion of creatinine without affecting the glomerular filtration rate. This means that while the creatinine level may rise, it does not necessarily indicate a decline in kidney function. Therefore, stopping abemaciclib (option D) may not be necessary at this point. Instead, obtaining a cystatin C level, which is a more reliable indicator of kidney function when creatinine levels may be unreliable, would be a more appropriate next step. This would allow for continued treatment with abemaciclib if the cystatin C level is normal, indicating that the kidney function is not actually impaired. The laboratory studies should be repeated in 1 week to monitor the patient's condition (option C).
Therefore, the answer is C. Obtain cystatin C level, continue abemaciclib, and repeat laboratory studies in 1 week.
