## Answer
To answer this question, we need to consider the most recent data and guidelines regarding hypertension. 

Option A suggests that the prevalence of hypertension in the United States is estimated to be 35% according to the 2017 AHA/ACC guideline. However, the 2017 AHA/ACC guideline actually broadened the definition of hypertension, which increased the estimated prevalence to nearly 46%, not 35%.

Option C suggests that hypertension affects 24% of adults in the United States aged 40â€“59 years. This seems low considering the broader definition of hypertension from the 2017 AHA/ACC guideline and the fact that hypertension prevalence generally increases with age.

Option D suggests that despite increasing prevalence, death rates attributed to hypertension have fallen in recent years. While it's true that treatments have improved, it's also true that hypertension-related death rates have actually increased in recent years, not fallen.

Option B states that according to the most recent US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), data from 2017 to 2018, rates of hypertension control have decreased. This is indeed true. The NHANES data showed that hypertension control rates have decreased in recent years, with less than half of adults with hypertension having their blood pressure under control.

Therefore, the answer is [B].
