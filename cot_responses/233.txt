## Answer
The patient's symptoms of muscle cramps, hypokalemia (low potassium), metabolic alkalosis (high bicarbonate), and high aldosterone levels suggest a condition that causes excessive renal potassium loss. The high aldosterone level is particularly suggestive of a condition that stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, leading to increased potassium excretion in the urine. 

Option A, abuse of laxatives, can cause hypokalemia, but it typically also causes metabolic acidosis due to loss of bicarbonate in the stool, not metabolic alkalosis as seen in this patient. 

Option C, herbal medicine containing glycyrrhizic acid, can cause hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, but it also suppresses aldosterone, which is not consistent with this patient's high aldosterone level. 

Option D, remote vomiting, can cause hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis, but it typically also causes hypochloremia due to loss of chloride in vomit, which is not seen in this patient. 

Option E, OTC thyroid supplementation, can cause hypokalemia in severe cases of thyrotoxicosis, but it would also cause other symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which are not mentioned in the question. 

Option B, surreptitious diuretic use, is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms. Diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, which the patient has a history of using, can cause hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and high aldosterone levels due to stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The patient's denial of current diuretic use may not be reliable, and the high urine potassium-to-creatinine ratio is consistent with diuretic-induced potassium loss in the urine.

Therefore, the answer is B. Surreptitious diuretic use.
