## Answer
The question provides information about a novel antihypertensive therapy that targets the juxtaglomerular apparatus. The juxtaglomerular apparatus is a part of the kidney that plays a crucial role in the regulation of blood pressure. It does this by secreting renin, which is a key enzyme in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The RAAS is a hormone system that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. 

The therapy is described as reducing plasma renin activity, reducing circulating (pro)renin levels, reducing urinary excretion of prostaglandin E-2 metabolites, and causing a modest reduction in blood pressure. These effects suggest that the therapy is inhibiting the RAAS. 

Option A, decreased expression of sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter, is unlikely because the question states that plasma osmolality and electrolytes were unaltered. This cotransporter is involved in the reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride ions in the kidney, and its inhibition would likely alter electrolyte levels.

Option C, increased expression of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme), would actually increase the activity of the RAAS, as ACE converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. This would likely increase blood pressure, not decrease it.

Option D, increased expression of angiotensin II receptor type 1, would also likely increase blood pressure, as angiotensin II acts on this receptor to cause vasoconstriction and stimulate the release of aldosterone, which promotes sodium and water retention.

Option B, decreased expression of the (pro)renin receptor, is the most likely mechanism. The (pro)renin receptor is involved in the activation of prorenin to renin, and its inhibition would reduce renin levels and activity, thereby inhibiting the RAAS and reducing blood pressure.

Therefore, the answer is B. Decreased expression of the (pro)renin receptor.
