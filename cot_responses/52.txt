## Answer
First, let's analyze the patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results. The normal range for pH is 7.35-7.45, PaCO2 is 35-45 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) is 22-28 mEq/L. In this case, the patient's pH is 7.45, which is at the upper limit of normal, indicating alkalosis. The PaCO2 is 54 mmHg, which is higher than normal, indicating respiratory acidosis. The bicarbonate is 36.5 mEq/L, which is higher than normal, indicating metabolic alkalosis.

Next, let's consider the patient's clinical presentation. She has chronic obstructive lung disease and congestive heart failure, both of which can lead to respiratory acidosis due to impaired gas exchange. She also has symptoms of an acute illness, including increased dyspnea, fever, nausea, vomiting, and cough, and physical examination findings of tachypnea and right basilar crackles. These findings suggest an acute exacerbation of her chronic lung disease, which could further contribute to respiratory acidosis.

The patient is also taking furosemide, a loop diuretic that can cause metabolic alkalosis by increasing renal bicarbonate reabsorption. Her total CO2 is elevated at 35 mmol/L, which is consistent with metabolic alkalosis.

There is no evidence of metabolic acidosis in this patient. Her bicarbonate level is elevated, not decreased as would be expected in metabolic acidosis. Her anion gap, calculated as sodium - (chloride + bicarbonate), is 140 - (85 + 36.5) = 18.5, which is within the normal range of 8-16, indicating that there is no significant unmeasured anion contributing to a metabolic acidosis.

Therefore, the answer is C. Respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
