## Answer
First, let's consider each option individually. 

Option A suggests that treatment of metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD stage III to stage V has been associated with a reduction in progression to ESKD. This is indeed correct. Metabolic acidosis is a common complication in patients with CKD, and studies have shown that treatment of metabolic acidosis with alkali therapy, such as bicarbonate, can slow the progression of CKD to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD).

Option B states that bicarbonate therapy has not been associated with improvements in mortality in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This is not entirely accurate. While it's true that the evidence is not as robust as we would like, some studies have suggested that bicarbonate therapy may reduce the risk of death in patients with CKD.

Option C suggests that patients with uncontrolled hypertension and advanced heart failure have been enrolled in RCTs investigating the use of NaHCO3 in CKD. This is unlikely to be true. Patients with these conditions would typically be excluded from such trials due to the potential risks associated with sodium bicarbonate therapy, such as fluid overload and worsening hypertension.

Option D states that in an RCT, treatment with veverimer was associated with improved [HCO3-] but no significant improvement in physical function scores. Veverimer is a non-absorbed, orally-administered polymer that binds and removes hydrochloric acid from the gastrointestinal tract, increasing bicarbonate in the body. While it's true that veverimer can improve bicarbonate levels, the statement that it does not improve physical function scores is not accurate. Studies have shown that veverimer can improve physical function in patients with metabolic acidosis associated with CKD.

Therefore, the answer is [A].
