## Answer
The patient's symptoms of episodic muscle weakness and hyperkalemia, which worsen with exercise and cold, are characteristic of hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, an autosomal dominant disorder. This condition is caused by a mutation in the SCN4A gene, which encodes the alpha subunit of the skeletal muscle cell sodium channel. This mutation leads to an increased sodium conductance and a decreased potassium conductance, resulting in an increased intracellular potassium concentration during episodes of paralysis. The fact that the patient's father, uncle, cousin, and sister all have similar symptoms suggests a genetic cause, further supporting this diagnosis. The other options (A, B, D) are related to other conditions that can cause hyperkalemia, but they do not fit with the patient's clinical presentation and family history.
Therefore, the answer is C. A mutation in the SCNA4 gene for the alpha subunit of the skeletal muscle cell sodium channel.
