## Answer
The patient's blood pressure (BP) variability is a concern. Studies have shown that both short-term and long-term BP variability are associated with increased risks of cardiovascular events and mortality. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is a method that measures blood pressure at regular intervals throughout the day and night. It is considered more accurate than office and home readings and is able to capture the short-term variability. In this case, the patient's ABPM shows marked variability, which is worrisome. Even though most readings are within the target range, the variability itself can increase the risk of adverse events. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that his BP is well controlled just because most of his ABPM readings are within range (Option A). It is also not accurate to say that only long-term BP variability is worrisome (Option C), or only short-term BP variability is worrisome (Option B). The correct statement is that he is at increased risk for a major adverse cardiovascular event or death due to his BP variability (Option D). Therefore, the answer is [D. He is at increased risk for a major adverse cardiovascular event or death].
