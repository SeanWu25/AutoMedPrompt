## Answer
The patient's lab results show an elevated intact PTH level, which is indicative of secondary hyperparathyroidism, a common complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs due to decreased renal synthesis of calcitriol, leading to decreased intestinal absorption of calcium and increased PTH secretion. The patient's 25-hydroxyvitamin D level is within the normal range, so there is no need for cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) supplementation (option A) or calcifediol (option B), which is a form of vitamin D used to treat deficiency. The patient's phosphorus level is within the normal range, so there is no need for a phosphate binder (option D). The patient's condition requires further evaluation and therapy, so option C is not appropriate. The most appropriate management would be to start calcitriol, which is the active form of vitamin D and can help to suppress PTH secretion and treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD patients. Therefore, the answer is E. Start calcitriol 0.25 Âµg per day.
