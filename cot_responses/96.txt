## Answer
The patient's history of multiple failed arteriovenous fistulas and grafts, along with the absence of visible upper extremity veins on physical examination, suggests that she has exhausted her options for traditional hemodialysis access. The ultrasound findings show that the cephalic vein is not visible in the forearm, but it is present and of adequate size in the upper arm. The basilic vein is also of adequate size. Given these findings, the best option for this patient would be to create a brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistula. This type of fistula uses the basilic vein, which is often larger and deeper than the cephalic vein, making it a good option when the cephalic vein is not available or suitable. The other options are less suitable: a brachiocephalic fistula would require a visible and suitable cephalic vein in the forearm, which this patient does not have; a forearm arteriovenous graft would also require a suitable vein in the forearm, and would not allow for the development of veins in the upper extremity for a secondary fistula; and contrast venography of the central veins would not be helpful in this case, as the problem is not suspected to be central venous stenosis, but rather a lack of suitable peripheral veins for hemodialysis access. Therefore, the answer is D. Plan a right brachiobasilic arteriovenous Ô¨Åstula because the cephalic vein is not visualized in the forearm.
