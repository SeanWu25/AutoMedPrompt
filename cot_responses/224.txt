## Answer
The patient's symptoms of fatigue, poor appetite, and weight loss, along with a standard Kt/Vurea of 1.9, suggest that he may not be receiving adequate dialysis. The goal is to increase the weekly standard Kt/Vurea to 2.4. 

Option A, converting to nocturnal HD 7 hours 5 times per week at the same dialysate volume of 30 L, would increase the time spent on dialysis, which would likely increase the dialysis dose and thus the Kt/Vurea. 

Option B, dialyzing for 4 hours five times per week, would also increase the time spent on dialysis, potentially increasing the Kt/Vurea. 

Option C, converting to in-center HD 4 hours three times per week, would actually decrease the frequency of dialysis sessions, which could potentially decrease the Kt/Vurea. 

Option D, converting to PD, may not be the best option for this patient, as it may not provide the necessary dialysis dose to reach the desired Kt/Vurea. 

Given these considerations, the best option would likely be to increase the time spent on dialysis, either through nocturnal HD (Option A) or by dialyzing for a longer period each session (Option B). Between these two, nocturnal HD would provide a longer dialysis time, which would likely result in a higher Kt/Vurea. 

Therefore, the answer is [A].
