## Answer
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition characterized by repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, leading to intermittent hypoxia and arousals from sleep. This condition is associated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity, which can lead to hypertension. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for OSA. It works by providing a constant stream of air to keep the airways open during sleep, thereby preventing apneas and hypopneas. This reduces the intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation, leading to a decrease in sympathetic nervous system activity. Decreased sympathetic activity can lead to a reduction in blood pressure. Therefore, the physiologic mechanism resulting in reduced BP in this patient after regular use of CPAP is decreased activity of renal nerves, which are part of the sympathetic nervous system. Increased circulating norepinephrine concentration, increased plasma angiotensin II concentrations, increased urinary aldosterone concentration, and decreased urinary sodium excretion are all associated with increased sympathetic activity or volume overload, which would increase, not decrease, blood pressure.
Therefore, the answer is [D. Decreased activity of renal nerves].
