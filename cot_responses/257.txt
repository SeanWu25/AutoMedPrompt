## Answer
The CKD-EPI 2009 equation for estimating kidney function includes a correction factor for Black individuals, which results in higher estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) and thus lower chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence estimates for this group. The CKD-EPI 2021 equation removes this race correction factor. Therefore, switching from the 2009 to the 2021 equation would likely result in lower eGFRs and higher CKD prevalence estimates for Black individuals. The change in equation would not directly affect the eGFRs or CKD prevalence estimates for White individuals, as there was no race correction factor for this group in the 2009 equation. Therefore, the answer is B. Prevalence would decrease among White adults and increase among Black adults.
