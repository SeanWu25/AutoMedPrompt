## Answer
Salt-sensitive hypertension is a condition where blood pressure increases in response to increased salt intake. The pathogenesis of salt-sensitive hypertension is complex and involves multiple mechanisms. However, the role of potassium in this condition is particularly interesting. A low-potassium diet can lead to increased sodium reabsorption, which can contribute to hypertension. 

Option A suggests increased aldosterone production. Aldosterone is a hormone that increases sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, which can lead to increased blood volume and blood pressure. However, aldosterone production is typically regulated by the renin-angiotensin system and is not directly affected by dietary potassium intake.

Option B suggests increased activity of the NCC in the distal convoluted tubule. The NCC (sodium-chloride cotransporter) is indeed involved in sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, but its activity is not directly influenced by dietary potassium.

Option C suggests increased activity of the ENaC in the aldosterone-sensitive portion of the distal tubule and collecting duct. The ENaC (epithelial sodium channel) is a key player in sodium reabsorption in the kidneys, and its activity can be influenced by dietary potassium. A low-potassium diet can lead to increased ENaC activity, resulting in increased sodium reabsorption and potentially contributing to salt-sensitive hypertension.

Option D suggests inhibition of WNK1 in the distal convoluted tubule. WNK1 is a kinase involved in regulating sodium and potassium balance in the body. However, its role in the pathogenesis of salt-sensitive hypertension, particularly in the context of a low-potassium diet, is not well established.

Therefore, the answer is C. Increased activity of the ENaC in the aldosterone-sensitive portion of the distal tubule and collecting duct.
