## Answer
The patient in the scenario is a kidney transplant recipient who is on immunosuppressive therapy and is interested in becoming pregnant. The immunosuppressive regimen includes tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Mycophenolate mofetil is known to be teratogenic and can cause miscarriages and congenital malformations. Therefore, it is recommended that women of childbearing age who wish to become pregnant should switch from mycophenolate mofetil to another immunosuppressant that is safer in pregnancy, such as azathioprine, prior to conception. Waiting until after pregnancy is diagnosed to make this switch could expose the fetus to the harmful effects of mycophenolate mofetil during early development. The other options are not recommended. Cesarean section is not routinely necessary in kidney transplant recipients, low-dose aspirin is not indicated unless there is a high risk of preeclampsia, and starting prednisone after delivery is not a standard practice to prevent transplant rejection. Therefore, the answer is [C. Switching mycophenolate mofetil to azathioprine should be delayed until immediately after pregnancy is diagnosed] is incorrect. The correct answer should be to switch mycophenolate mofetil to azathioprine before pregnancy. However, since this option is not available, none of the provided options are correct.
