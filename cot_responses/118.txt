## Answer
Intra-dialytic hypotension (IH) is a common complication of hemodialysis and is associated with several adverse outcomes. The patient in the scenario is experiencing recurrent IH, with systolic blood pressure dropping to as low as 85 mmHg during dialysis sessions. Although he is asymptomatic, this does not mean that the IH is without risk. 

Option A suggests that asymptomatic IH does not increase mortality risk. However, research has shown that IH, whether symptomatic or not, is associated with increased mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis. 

Option B suggests that IH does not impact dialysis recovery time. However, IH can lead to inadequate dialysis and longer recovery times as it may necessitate stopping or slowing the dialysis treatment.

Option D suggests that the frequency of IH is reduced by blood volume monitoringâ€“guided ultrafiltration biofeedback. While this is a strategy that can be used to manage IH, it does not directly address the significance of IH itself.

Option E suggests that IH is not associated with increased risk of hospital readmission. However, IH can lead to complications such as cardiovascular events that may require hospitalization.

Option C states that a drop in systolic pressure to < 90 mmHg is associated with increased mortality risk. This is consistent with the understanding that IH, even when asymptomatic, is associated with adverse outcomes, including increased mortality. 

Therefore, the answer is [C. A drop in systolic pressure to < 90 mmHg is associated with increased mortality risk].
