## Answer
Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder characterized by new-onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. The diagnosis is made when a pregnant woman presents with a blood pressure of â‰¥140/90 mmHg on two occasions at least 4 hours apart and proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation. However, in the absence of proteinuria, preeclampsia can still be diagnosed if there is new-onset hypertension and the new onset of any of the following: thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, impaired liver function, pulmonary edema, or cerebral or visual symptoms.

Option A, the absence of edema, is not a reliable feature to exclude preeclampsia. Edema is a common finding in normal pregnancy and is no longer included in the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia.

Option B, the absence of preeclampsia in her first pregnancy, does not exclude the possibility of preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies. Although a history of preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy increases the risk, it can still occur in women with no history of the condition.

Option D, a normal serum uric acid, is not a reliable feature to exclude preeclampsia. Although elevated serum uric acid levels are often seen in preeclampsia, normal levels do not rule out the condition.

Option C, a low soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 to placental growth factor ratio, is the most useful feature for excluding the diagnosis of preeclampsia within the next week. These are angiogenic factors that are altered in women with preeclampsia. A low ratio of these factors is associated with a low risk of developing preeclampsia within the next week.

Therefore, the answer is [C. A low soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 to placental growth factor ratio].
