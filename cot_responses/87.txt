## Answer
To answer this question, we need to understand the eligibility criteria for simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation. The criteria generally include patients with end-stage liver disease who also have severe kidney dysfunction. 

Option A describes a 64-year-old man with stage 3 CKD and a recent fall in eGFR during a period of hypovolemia. This patient has chronic kidney disease and a recent acute kidney injury, which makes him a potential candidate for simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation.

Option B describes a 19-year-old woman with primary hyper-oxaluria, nephrocalcinosis, and stage 5 CKD. Primary hyperoxaluria is a condition that often leads to kidney failure and is an indication for simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation.

Option C describes a 54-year-old man with HCV infection, type 2 diabetes mellitus, an eGFR of 35–40 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and proteinuria of 1 g/d. This patient has chronic liver disease (HCV infection) and chronic kidney disease (indicated by the reduced eGFR and proteinuria), making him a potential candidate for simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation.

Option D describes a patient with type 2 hepatorenal syndrome with an eGFR of 15–25 ml/min per 1.73 m2 over the past 6 weeks. Hepatorenal syndrome is a type of kidney failure that occurs in patients with severe liver disease. However, the key point here is that type 2 hepatorenal syndrome is typically reversible with liver transplantation alone, so simultaneous kidney transplantation is not usually indicated.

Therefore, the answer is [D].
