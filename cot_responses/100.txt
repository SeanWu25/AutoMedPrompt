## Answer
First, let's consider each statement individually. 

Option A suggests that increased serum uric acid is a risk factor for stone formation in men without a previous history of stone formation. While it's true that high levels of uric acid can lead to the formation of uric acid stones, it's not specific to men or those without a previous history of stone formation. 

Option B states that lowering serum uric acid reduces the risk of calcium stone formation. This is not accurate because calcium stones are primarily caused by high calcium levels, not high uric acid levels. 

Option C is similar to option A but refers to women. As with option A, high uric acid levels can lead to uric acid stones, but it's not specific to women or those without a previous history of stone formation. 

Option D suggests that serum uric acid predicts the risk of uric acid stone, but not calcium stone, formation. This is accurate because high uric acid levels can lead to uric acid stones, but not calcium stones. 

Option E states that patients with hyperuricemia usually have hyperuricosuria. While it's true that hyperuricemia can lead to hyperuricosuria, it's not a universal rule and doesn't directly relate to kidney stone formation.

Therefore, the answer is D. Serum uric acid predicts the risk of uric acid stone, but not calcium stone, formation.
