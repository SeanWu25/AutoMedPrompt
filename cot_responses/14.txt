## Answer
Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, often the liver and kidneys. It usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure had been normal. Even though preeclampsia resolves after delivery, it has been associated with an increased risk of certain health conditions later in life. 

Option A is incorrect because preeclampsia does have long-term effects on the mother's health. 

Option B is incorrect because there is no established link between preeclampsia and an increased risk of hyperthyroidism. 

Option C is correct because preeclampsia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Women who have had preeclampsia have approximately double the risk for heart disease and stroke and they also have an increased risk of developing hypertension in the future.

Option D is incorrect because the risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is not as high as 5% in women who have had preeclampsia. 

Option E is incorrect because there is no established link between preeclampsia and an increased risk of endometrial cancer.

Therefore, the answer is [C. It increases the risk of cardiovascular disease].
