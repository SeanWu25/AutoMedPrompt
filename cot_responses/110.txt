## Answer
The patient's clinical presentation and kidney biopsy findings are consistent with anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease, also known as Goodpasture syndrome. This is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and often pulmonary hemorrhage. The presence of linear IgG deposition along the GBMs on immunofluorescence is pathognomonic. The presence of anti-GBM antibodies in the serum confirms the diagnosis. 

The patient also has proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA, which is typically associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). The coexistence of anti-GBM disease and ANCA-associated vasculitis, known as double-positive disease, is rare but recognized. 

The treatment of anti-GBM disease involves aggressive immunosuppression with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, as well as plasmapheresis to remove circulating anti-GBM antibodies. This treatment regimen is also effective for ANCA-associated vasculitis. 

The goal of treatment is to induce remission, after which immunosuppression can be tapered. Maintenance immunosuppression is not typically required for anti-GBM disease because it is a monophasic illness and relapses are rare once remission is achieved. 

Therefore, the answer is B. You continue treatment for anti-GBM disease with plasmapheresis, steroids, and cyclophosphamide. and after the patient goes into remission you taper off all immunosuppression.
