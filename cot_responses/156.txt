## Answer
This patient's fever and chills in the setting of hemodialysis via a tunneled catheter are concerning for catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). CRBSI is a common complication in patients receiving hemodialysis via a central venous catheter. The diagnosis of CRBSI requires blood cultures, and the most accurate method is to compare cultures drawn from the catheter and from a peripheral vein. However, in this case, no peripheral veins are available for culture. Therefore, the next best step is to draw two sets of blood cultures from different lumens of the catheter before starting empiric antibiotics. This approach will provide the best chance of identifying the causative organism and will guide definitive antibiotic therapy. Therefore, the answer is A. Obtain two sets of blood cultures from the hemodialysis catheter before administering antibiotics.
