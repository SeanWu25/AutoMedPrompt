## Answer
The patient's symptoms and lab results are indicative of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with lupus nephritis. The question asks about recent developments in treatment options for lupus nephritis. 

Option A suggests Rituximab as an effective treatment for lupus nephritis. However, randomized controlled trials have not shown a significant benefit of Rituximab over standard therapy in lupus nephritis.

Option B suggests that obinutuzumab improves renal responses but increases the risk of infection. However, there is not enough evidence from randomized controlled trials to support this claim.

Option C suggests that Belimumab has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of lupus nephritis and extrarenal manifestations of SLE. Recent studies have indeed shown that Belimumab, when added to standard therapy, can improve renal outcomes in patients with lupus nephritis.

Option D suggests that Calcineurin inhibitors, such as voclosporin, are an effective alternative to mycophenolate mofetil for the treatment of proliferative lupus nephritis. While voclosporin has shown promise in some studies, it is not yet considered a standard alternative to mycophenolate mofetil.

Option E suggests that the addition of anifrolumab to standard therapy results in greater improvements in proteinuria in patients with high type 1 IFN gene signatures. However, the evidence supporting this claim is not strong enough.

Therefore, the answer is [C. Belimumab, in addition to standard therapy, has demonstrated efÔ¨Åcacy in the treatment of lupus nephritis and extrarenal manifestations of SLE].
