## Answer
Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a type of progressive kidney failure seen in people with severe liver damage, most often caused by cirrhosis. As the liver fails, the kidneys also start to fail, leading to a decrease in renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). 

Option A is correct because in HRS, there is activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), leading to increased plasma angiotensin concentrations. 

Option B is also correct. The sympathetic nervous system is activated in response to the decreased effective circulating volume, leading to increased visceral sympathetic nervous system activity.

Option D is correct as well. Systemic blood pressure is often reduced in HRS due to the decreased effective circulating volume.

Option E is correct. In response to the decreased effective circulating volume, the body increases the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin), leading to increased plasma vasopressin concentrations.

Option C, however, is incorrect. Portal blood flow is not reduced in hepatorenal syndrome. In fact, splanchnic vasodilation, which is a hallmark of cirrhosis, leads to an increase in portal blood flow. This vasodilation is a compensatory mechanism to increase the effective circulating volume, but it also contributes to the decrease in systemic vascular resistance and arterial pressure seen in HRS.

Therefore, the answer is [C. Portal blood ï¬‚ow is reduced].
