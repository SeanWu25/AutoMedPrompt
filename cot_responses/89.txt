## Answer
The patient's symptoms of heart failure, such as dyspnea, ascites, and edema, are not improving despite attempts to lower her dry weight through dialysis. This suggests that her heart failure may not be solely due to volume overload. The presence of a large, tortuous arteriovenous fistula could be contributing to her heart failure by increasing cardiac output. This is known as high-output heart failure. In this condition, the heart has to work harder to pump blood through the large arteriovenous fistula, which can lead to heart failure. Therefore, the next step in management should be to measure the access flow and cardiac output to confirm this diagnosis. 

Adjusting erythropoiesis-stimulating therapy (Option A) is not the most appropriate next step because her hemoglobin level is already within the target range for patients with chronic kidney disease. Placement of a tunneled catheter for dialysis and ligation of the arteriovenous fistula (Option B) could be considered if high-output heart failure is confirmed, but this is a more invasive step that should be taken after confirming the diagnosis. Aggressive paracentesis (Option D) could help relieve symptoms of volume overload, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's heart failure.

Therefore, the answer is C. Measurement of access flow and cardiac output.
