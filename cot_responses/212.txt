## Answer
Vascular calcification is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It is a complex process influenced by various factors including hyperphosphatemia, hypercalcemia, and vitamin K deficiency.

A. Magnesium supplement: Magnesium has been shown to inhibit vascular calcification, particularly in the setting of chronic kidney disease. It acts as a natural calcium antagonist to inhibit the transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells into osteoblast-like cells, a key step in vascular calcification.

B. Vitamin K supplement: Vitamin K is necessary for the activation of matrix Gla protein, a potent inhibitor of vascular calcification. Vitamin K deficiency, which can occur in chronic kidney disease, can therefore contribute to vascular calcification.

C. Calcium-containing phosphate binder: Calcium-containing phosphate binders are commonly used to control hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, they can contribute to hypercalcemia and positive calcium balance, which can promote vascular calcification.

D. Calcimimetic agents: Calcimimetics are drugs that mimic the action of calcium on tissues, reducing parathyroid hormone levels. They are used in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease. By reducing serum calcium and phosphate levels, they can help to prevent vascular calcification.

Therefore, the answer is C. Calcium-containing phosphate binder.
