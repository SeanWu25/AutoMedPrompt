## Answer
When dealing with blood spills, it is important to ensure that all potential pathogens are effectively eliminated. Soap and water may not be sufficient to kill all pathogens, especially bloodborne ones. A tuberculocidal disinfectant is a strong disinfectant that is capable of killing a wide range of pathogens, including those that are bloodborne. However, a single application may not be sufficient to ensure all pathogens are killed. A double application increases the chances of eliminating all pathogens. Therefore, the answer is D. Double application of tuberculocidal disinfectant.
