## Answer
First, we need to consider the patient's current condition and history. The patient is a 71-year-old white woman with a history of high blood pressure (hypertension) in her 40s and 50s, and currently has low blood pressure (hypotension). The question is about the link between her blood pressure and the risk of dementia.

Option A suggests that low blood pressure in patients her age is not linked to dementia. However, some studies suggest that both high and low blood pressure could be associated with an increased risk of dementia, especially in older adults. Therefore, this option may not be entirely accurate.

Option B suggests that low blood pressure in patients her age is linked to dementia if patients have a history of high blood pressure. This seems plausible as both conditions have been associated with an increased risk of dementia.

Option C suggests that low blood pressure in patients her age is linked to dementia only if patients are African Americans and have a history of high blood pressure. However, the patient in question is white, not African American, so this option is not applicable.

Option D suggests that low blood pressure in patients her age is linked to dementia only if patients are genetically susceptible to dementia and have a history of high blood pressure. While genetic susceptibility can indeed increase the risk of dementia, the question does not provide any information about the patient's genetic predisposition.

Given the information provided, option B seems to be the most accurate. It takes into account the patient's history of high blood pressure and her current low blood pressure, both of which could potentially increase her risk of dementia.

Therefore, the answer is B. Low BP in patients her age is linked to dementia if patients have a history of high BP.
