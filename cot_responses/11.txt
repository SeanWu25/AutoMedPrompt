## Answer
The patient's symptoms of brisk reflexes and a slight headache, along with her high blood pressure, suggest that she is still experiencing effects of preeclampsia. Intravenous magnesium is typically used to prevent seizures in patients with preeclampsia, and should be continued for 24 hours postpartum or until the symptoms of preeclampsia resolve. Therefore, discontinuing magnesium (options A, B, and C) would not be appropriate at this time. 

The patient's blood pressure is still high, indicating that her hypertension is not yet under control. Therefore, discontinuing her antihypertensive medications (option A) would not be appropriate. 

Furosemide (option C) is a diuretic and is not typically used as first-line treatment for hypertension in preeclampsia. 

Transitioning to oral antihypertensive medications (option D) would be a reasonable step, as these can be continued after the patient is discharged from the hospital. 

Therefore, the answer is [D. Continue intravenous magnesium and transition to oral antihypertensive medications].
