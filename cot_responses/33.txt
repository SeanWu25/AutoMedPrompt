## Answer
The patient's symptoms of fatigue and social withdrawal, along with her laboratory findings of hypercalcemia and elevated PTH, suggest a diagnosis related to hyperparathyroidism. The fact that her family does not have hypercalcemia rules out familial conditions such as familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and familial isolated hyperparathyroidism. Sarcoidosis, a systemic inflammatory disease, can cause hypercalcemia, but it is typically associated with elevated levels of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, which is not the case here. The patient's use of lithium is notable, as lithium is known to increase the set point of calcium for suppression of PTH, which can lead to hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, the answer is C. Lithiumâ€“related primary hyperparathyroidism.
