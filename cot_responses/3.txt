## Answer
The Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) guidelines for the management of hypertension in adults recommend a blood pressure target of less than 150/90 mmHg for patients aged 60 years or older without diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. This patient's blood pressure of 132/74 mmHg is well below this target, and she is asymptomatic. Therefore, there is no need to adjust her current antihypertensive regimen. Discontinuing either of her medications could potentially lead to an increase in her blood pressure, which would not be beneficial. Therefore, the answer is [D. Make no changes to the current regimen].
