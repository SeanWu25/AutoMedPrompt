## Answer
The patient in the scenario has stage 1 hypertension and multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), including daily smoking, obesity, glucose intolerance, sedentary lifestyle, and family history of premature CVD. Despite attempts at lifestyle modification, his circumstances have not improved. 

Option A suggests that observation is the best approach due to low 10-year ASCVD risk scores in young adults. However, this patient has multiple risk factors for CVD, which increases his risk despite his young age. Therefore, simply observing without intervention may not be the best approach.

Option B suggests that lifestyle modification alone should be encouraged until the age of 40 years. While lifestyle modification is indeed important, this patient has already attempted lifestyle changes without success. Therefore, relying solely on lifestyle modification may not be sufficient.

Option C suggests that all patients with continued stage 1 hypertension should be prescribed medication after 6 months of lifestyle changes. While medication can indeed be beneficial, this approach does not take into account individual patient factors, such as the presence of multiple risk factors for CVD.

Option D suggests that after 6 months of lifestyle therapy, drug treatment should be considered for patients with a history of premature birth or multiple cardiovascular risk factors. This approach seems to be the most reasonable, as it takes into account the patient's individual risk factors and the fact that lifestyle changes alone have not been sufficient.

Therefore, the answer is [D. After 6 months of lifestyle therapy, drug treatment should be considered for patients with a history of premature birth or multiple cardiovascular risk factors].
