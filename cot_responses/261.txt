## Answer
First, let's evaluate each option individually. 

Option A suggests that Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors should be stopped with eGFR < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2 due to the risk of hyperkalemia. While it's true that RAS inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia, especially in patients with advanced CKD, they are not typically discontinued solely based on a specific eGFR threshold. Instead, the decision to continue or discontinue these medications is usually based on individual patient factors, including the patient's overall cardiovascular risk, their ability to tolerate the medication, and their serum potassium levels.

Option B suggests that excessively tight BP control may be associated with worsening GFR, and his medications should be titrated to a target BP of > 130/80 mm Hg. While it's true that excessively tight BP control can potentially lead to worsening renal function, the patient's current BP of 116/68 mm Hg is within the recommended range for patients with CKD, which is generally less than 130/80 mm Hg. Therefore, there is no need to titrate his medications to achieve a higher BP target.

Option D suggests that in a study comparing new users of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (DHP-CCB) versus RAS inhibitors in subjects with CKD G4â€“5 not on dialysis, there was a significantly lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular event and mortality in patients taking DHP-CCB. While DHP-CCBs can be effective for managing hypertension in patients with CKD, there is no strong evidence to suggest that they are associated with a significantly lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality compared to RAS inhibitors in this patient population.

Option C suggests that compared with continuing RAS inhibition, stopping this therapy is associated with a higher absolute risk of death and major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with CKD 4. This statement is true. Several studies have shown that discontinuing RAS inhibitors in patients with CKD can lead to a higher risk of death and major adverse cardiovascular events, even in those with advanced disease. This is because RAS inhibitors have been shown to slow the progression of kidney disease and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with CKD.

Therefore, the answer is [C].
