## Answer
The Frequent Hemodialysis Network (FHN) Daily Trial was a study that aimed to determine the effects of frequent hemodialysis on patients with kidney disease. The intervention group in this study received more frequent hemodialysis treatments than the control group. 

Option A suggests an increase in left ventricular mass. However, frequent hemodialysis is generally associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes, not worsening. Therefore, this option is unlikely.

Option B suggests higher Physical Health Composite scores. This is plausible as frequent hemodialysis could potentially improve the physical health of patients by more effectively removing waste products from the blood.

Option C suggests improved relative mortality. While it is possible that frequent hemodialysis could improve survival rates, the FHN Daily Trial did not find a significant difference in mortality between the intervention and control groups.

Option D suggests a reduction in hospitalization rates. This is also plausible as frequent hemodialysis could potentially reduce the need for hospitalization by better managing patients' symptoms. However, the FHN Daily Trial did not find a significant difference in hospitalization rates between the intervention and control groups.

Therefore, based on the outcomes of the FHN Daily Trial, the most likely answer is B. Higher Physical Health Composite scores. This is because the trial found that patients in the intervention group had improved physical health outcomes compared to the control group. 

Therefore, the answer is [B. Higher Physical Health Composite scores].
