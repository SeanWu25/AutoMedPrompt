## Answer
The BK virus (BKV) is a common virus that many people get in childhood. In most people, it stays inactive without causing any symptoms. However, in people with weakened immune systems, such as organ transplant recipients, the virus can become active and cause disease. In kidney transplant recipients, BKV can cause a disease called BKV nephropathy, which can lead to kidney damage and graft loss. In this case, the patient has BKV viremia but no evidence of BKV nephropathy. However, the presence of the virus in the blood indicates that the patient is at risk of developing BKV nephropathy. The other options (development of de novo donor-specific antibodies, development of a second viral infection, and increased mortality) are not specifically associated with BKV viremia. Therefore, the answer is B. Graft loss due to BKV nephropathy.
