## Answer
The patient's clinical presentation and biopsy findings are consistent with calciphylaxis, a rare and serious condition seen most commonly in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Calciphylaxis is characterized by calcification of the small- and medium-sized vessels in the dermis and subcutaneous fat, leading to ischemia and painful skin lesions. The presence of arteriolar calcification, as seen in this patient, is a characteristic finding in calciphylaxis and suggests an advanced stage of the disease. 

The prognosis for patients with calciphylaxis is generally poor, with a 1-year mortality rate of up to 50-80%. This high mortality rate is often due to sepsis resulting from non-healing skin ulcers. Therefore, the presence of arteriolar calcification does suggest a worse prognosis (Option A), and the 1-year mortality rate for patients with this condition is significantly higher than 10% (Option C is incorrect). 

The presence of arteriolar thrombosis is a finding in calciphylaxis, but it is not necessarily indicative of an advanced stage or worse prognosis (Option B is incorrect). The location of skin lesions does not influence the prognosis (Option D is incorrect), and ulcerated lesions generally have a worse prognosis than non-ulcerated lesions due to the risk of secondary infection (Option E is incorrect).

Therefore, the answer is [A. The presence of arteriolar calciÔ¨Åcation suggests advanced lesion stage and worse prognosis].
