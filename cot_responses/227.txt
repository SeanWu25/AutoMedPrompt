## Answer
The patient is asking about his prognosis if he were to discontinue dialysis. This is a serious question and it's important to provide an accurate and honest response. Option A suggests referring the patient to a social worker to screen for depression, but this doesn't directly answer the patient's question. Option D suggests referring the patient to outpatient palliative care without providing any information about his prognosis, which also doesn't directly answer the patient's question. Option C suggests that the patient could live for several weeks without dialysis, but this is a vague estimate and may not be accurate. Option B provides a more specific estimate, stating that patients may live about 7 days without dialysis, but this can vary depending on other medical conditions and residual renal function. This response is both honest and informative, providing the patient with a realistic understanding of his prognosis. Therefore, the answer is B. “Prognosis varies; however, most experience tells us that on average patients may live about 7 days without dialysis; This may be slightly more or less depending on other medical conditions that someone has, and how much residual renal function one has”.
