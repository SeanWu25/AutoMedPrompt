## Answer
The patient's presentation is consistent with preeclampsia, which is defined as new-onset hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation and either proteinuria or end-organ dysfunction. In this case, the patient has new-onset hypertension and proteinuria. The management of preeclampsia depends on the gestational age and the severity of the disease. In this case, the patient is at 35 weeks of gestation and has no severe features of preeclampsia (e.g., severe hypertension, thrombocytopenia, impaired liver function, renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema, or visual or cerebral symptoms). Therefore, the most appropriate management is expectant management with close monitoring of maternal and fetal well-being until 37 weeks of gestation or until severe features or eclampsia develop. Immediate delivery is indicated for preeclampsia with severe features or eclampsia, or for any preeclampsia at or beyond 37 weeks of gestation. Intravenous magnesium is used for seizure prophylaxis in severe preeclampsia or eclampsia, but is not indicated in this case. A kidney biopsy is not indicated in the management of preeclampsia.

Therefore, the answer is C. Observation with expectant medical management.
