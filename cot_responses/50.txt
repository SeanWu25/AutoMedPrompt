## Answer
The patient's symptoms of nocturnal polyuria improved after starting desmopressin, but he developed hyponatremia, which is a known side effect of desmopressin. Desmopressin is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin, which increases water reabsorption in the kidneys, leading to dilutional hyponatremia. The patient's heart failure could also contribute to hyponatremia due to the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and nonosmotic vasopressin release, leading to water retention. 

Option A, discontinuing desmopressin, would likely reverse the hyponatremia but would also likely worsen the patient's nocturnal polyuria. Option B, discontinuing desmopressin and giving a bolus of 3% saline, would rapidly increase the patient's serum sodium level, but this is not necessary as the patient is asymptomatic and his serum sodium level is not dangerously low. Rapid correction of hyponatremia can lead to osmotic demyelination syndrome. 

Option C, continuing desmopressin and decreasing fluid intake in response to thirst only, is the most appropriate management. This would allow the patient to continue benefiting from the effects of desmopressin on his nocturnal polyuria while also preventing further dilution of his serum sodium. 

Option D, continuing desmopressin and increasing dietary sodium, would not be effective in treating the patient's hyponatremia because the problem is not a lack of sodium but rather an excess of water due to the effects of desmopressin.

Therefore, the answer is C. Continue desmopressin, decreasing ï¬‚uid in-take in response to thirst only.
