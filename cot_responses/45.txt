## Answer
The patient's family history of sudden death during routine maintenance dialysis treatments is a significant risk factor for sudden cardiac arrest. This is because genetic factors can play a role in the risk of sudden cardiac arrest, and a family history of sudden cardiac arrest or other heart conditions can increase this risk. The other options, such as propranolol therapy, serum potassium concentration, serum magnesium, and serum PTH concentration, while important to monitor in a patient with ESRD, are not as strongly linked to the risk of sudden cardiac arrest as a family history of the condition. Propranolol is a beta-blocker used to treat high blood pressure and heart problems, and while it can have side effects, it is not typically associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest. The patient's serum potassium, magnesium, and PTH levels are all within normal ranges, so they would not contribute to an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest. Therefore, the answer is D. Her family history.
