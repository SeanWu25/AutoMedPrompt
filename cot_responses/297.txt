## Answer
First, let's understand the question and the options. The question is asking about drug-induced hypocalcemia, which is a condition where the level of calcium in the blood is lower than normal due to the use of certain medications. 

Option A suggests that the risk of hypocalcemia is doubled in patients treated with calcimimetics compared to controls. Calcimimetics are drugs that mimic the action of calcium on tissues and are used to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease. They can indeed cause hypocalcemia as they decrease the production of parathyroid hormone, which in turn reduces calcium levels in the blood.

Option B states that Denosumab rarely causes hypocalcemia in patients on hemodialysis. Denosumab is a medication used to treat osteoporosis and bone diseases. It works by slowing down the process of bone breakdown. However, it can cause hypocalcemia, especially in patients with kidney disease or those on dialysis.

Option C suggests that high alkaline phosphatase levels are a risk factor for calcimimetic-induced hypocalcemia. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme found in several tissues throughout the body, including the liver and bone. Elevated levels can indicate a problem with the liver or bones, but there's no established link between high alkaline phosphatase levels and an increased risk of calcimimetic-induced hypocalcemia.

Option D states that Denosumab has not been shown to be effective in kidney transplant recipients. This statement is not related to hypocalcemia, but rather to the efficacy of Denosumab in a specific patient population.

Given the above analysis, the most accurate statement regarding drug-induced hypocalcemia is option A, as both calcimimetics and Denosumab can cause hypocalcemia, but the risk is indeed higher with calcimimetics.

Therefore, the answer is [A].
