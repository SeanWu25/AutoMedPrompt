## Answer
The patient's history of acute kidney disease during childhood could potentially increase his lifetime risk of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Even though his current eGFR is normal, it does not necessarily mean that his risk is not increased. The childhood illness is relevant because it involved a kidney problem, which could have long-term effects on kidney function. However, the initiation of dialysis in adults with a history of childhood CKD does not necessarily occur at a later age. This is because the progression of kidney disease can vary greatly among individuals and is influenced by many factors, including the underlying cause of the kidney disease, the individual's overall health, and how well the kidney disease is managed. Therefore, the answer is A. His lifetime risk of ESRD may be increased by more than fourfold because of his childhood history of kidney injury.
