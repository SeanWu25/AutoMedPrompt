## Answer
The patient's clinical scenario suggests that he has developed acute kidney injury (AKI) during his hospital stay. The cause of AKI in this case could be multifactorial, including the severity of his COVID-19 illness, potential drug-induced nephrotoxicity, and other factors. 

Option A suggests that remdesivir is the most likely cause of his AKI. While remdesivir has been associated with acute kidney injury, it is not the most common cause of AKI in patients with COVID-19. The AKI in this case is more likely due to the severity of the patient's illness, including hypoxia and systemic inflammation.

Option B suggests that a kidney biopsy would most likely show thrombotic microangiopathy. While thrombotic microangiopathy can occur in severe cases of COVID-19, it is not the most common finding in kidney biopsies of patients with COVID-19 and AKI. The most common findings are acute tubular injury and collapsing glomerulopathy.

Option D suggests that AKI most commonly occurs in the first 5 days of COVID-19 illness. However, AKI in patients with COVID-19 typically occurs later in the course of the illness, often in the second week of symptoms, which aligns with the timeline in this patient's case.

Option C suggests that the mortality of stage 3 AKI in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with COVID-19 exceeds 50%. This statement is correct. Studies have shown that the mortality rate in patients with COVID-19 and AKI, particularly those requiring renal replacement therapy, is high, often exceeding 50%.

Therefore, the answer is [C. The mortality of stage 3 AKI in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with COVID-19 exceeds 50%].
