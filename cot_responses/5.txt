## Answer
Primary aldosteronism is a condition characterized by excessive secretion of aldosterone, which leads to high blood pressure and low potassium levels. It can be caused by an adrenal adenoma (a benign tumor), which can be treated surgically, or by bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, which is usually treated with medication. 

The aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR) is used as a screening test for primary aldosteronism. A high ARR suggests the presence of the condition, but it does not differentiate between the different causes. Therefore, option A is not the best answer.

The selectivity index and the lateralization index are used in adrenal vein sampling (AVS), a procedure that helps to differentiate between unilateral and bilateral disease. A selectivity index of more than 2 indicates successful cannulation of the adrenal vein, and a lateralization index of more than 4 suggests unilateral disease. Therefore, option B and C are not the best answers because the values given are below the thresholds used in practice.

Contralateral suppression of aldosterone during AVS indicates unilateral disease, which is more likely to benefit from surgery. This is because removing the affected adrenal gland can potentially cure the condition. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

A low peripheral venous aldosterone/cortisol ratio is not typically used to identify individuals with primary aldosteronism who are most likely to benefit from surgery. Therefore, option E is not the correct answer.

Therefore, the answer is D. Contralateral suppression of aldosterone.
