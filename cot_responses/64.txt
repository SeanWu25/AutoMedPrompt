## Answer
Rhabdomyolysis is a serious syndrome due to a direct or indirect muscle injury. It results from the death of muscle fibers and release of their contents into the bloodstream. This can lead to serious complications such as renal (kidney) failure. This means the kidneys cannot remove waste and concentrated urine. In many cases, the cause of rhabdomyolysis is clear â€” for example, a crush injury to the leg. But sometimes, it's not clear why it happens.

Looking at the options, head injury (B) and abdominal injury (C) are less likely to cause rhabdomyolysis as they do not directly involve muscle injury. Chest injury (A) could potentially cause rhabdomyolysis if it involves significant muscle damage, but it's not the most likely option.

The gunshot versus explosive mechanism injury (D) is the most likely to cause rhabdomyolysis. This is because both gunshot and explosive injuries can cause extensive direct muscle damage, leading to the release of muscle cell contents into the bloodstream. 

Therefore, the answer is [D. Gunshot versus explosive mechanism injury].
