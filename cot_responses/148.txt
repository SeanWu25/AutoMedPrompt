## Answer
The patient's presentation is suggestive of nephrotic syndrome, characterized by edema, hypertension, and increased proteinuria. The patient's recent initiation of sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a key clue. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are known to cause proteinuria and hypertension, and in severe cases, they can lead to a condition known as thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). TMA is characterized by endothelial injury leading to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. However, this patient's complete blood count is normal, which makes TMA less likely. 

Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome, but it is typically associated with HIV infection, heroin use, or obesity, none of which are present in this patient. 

Renal vein thrombosis can cause nephrotic syndrome, but it is usually associated with flank pain and hematuria, which are not present in this patient. 

Progression of diabetic nephropathy could explain the increased proteinuria and worsening renal function, but it would not typically cause such a rapid and dramatic increase in proteinuria. 

Immune complex glomerulonephritis can cause nephrotic syndrome, but it is usually associated with conditions like lupus or infections, which are not present in this patient. 

Given the patient's recent initiation of sorafenib and the absence of other likely causes, the most likely diagnosis is sorafenib-induced nephrotic syndrome. However, this option is not given. Among the given options, the most likely diagnosis is progression of diabetic nephropathy, as it can be exacerbated by any additional renal insult, including medications like sorafenib.

Therefore, the answer is C. Progression of diabetic nephropathy.
