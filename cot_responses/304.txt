## Answer
The patient's presentation of an indurated, tender area with purple discoloration on the skin, especially in the context of her medical history, is suggestive of a hematoma. Hematomas are localized collections of blood outside the blood vessels, usually in liquid form within a tissue. They can occur due to trauma, but in this case, the patient's medical history and medications are more likely to be the cause. 

Warfarin is an anticoagulant medication that is used to prevent the formation of blood clots. It works by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. However, one of the potential side effects of warfarin is bleeding, including the formation of hematomas. This can occur even without any apparent trauma, especially in patients who are on long-term warfarin therapy. 

On the other hand, glargine and lispro insulin are used for the management of diabetes and do not typically cause hematomas. Sevelamer is a phosphate binder used in patients with end-stage kidney disease to prevent hyperphosphatemia, and it does not have hematoma formation as a side effect. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker used for hypertension and atrial fibrillation, and it also does not typically cause hematomas.

Therefore, the answer is D. Warfarin.
