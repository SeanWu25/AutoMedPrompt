## Answer
To answer this question, we need to consider the characteristics and findings associated with lupus nephritis. 

Option A suggests that lupus nephritis is being diagnosed at a younger age. However, there is no specific evidence to suggest that the age of diagnosis is decreasing. Lupus nephritis can occur at any age, but it most often affects people between the ages of 20 and 40.

Option B states that the time from diagnosis of SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus) to the development of lupus nephritis is shorter in African Americans and other minority groups. This is indeed correct. Studies have shown that African Americans and other minority groups are at a higher risk for lupus nephritis and tend to develop the condition earlier after the diagnosis of SLE.

Option C suggests that in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis who undergo repeated biopsy, histologic findings correlate closely with clinical response to treatment. This is not entirely accurate. While biopsy can provide valuable information about the severity and type of lupus nephritis, it does not always correlate with the clinical response to treatment. 

Option D states that Anti-PLA2R antibodies are occasionally identified in patients with class V lupus nephritis. Anti-PLA2R antibodies are typically associated with membranous nephropathy, not lupus nephritis. 

Therefore, the answer is B. The time from diagnosis of SLE to the development of lupus nephritis is shorter in African Americans and other minority groups.
