## Answer
SGLT2 inhibitors are a class of medications used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and have been shown to have significant renal and cardiovascular benefits. 

Option A is incorrect. While it is true that the FDA initially recommended against the initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors at an eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2, more recent studies have shown benefits in patients with lower eGFRs. The DAPA-CKD trial, for example, showed benefits in patients with an eGFR as low as 25 ml/min/1.73 m2.

Option B is also incorrect. SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to provide additional renal benefits even in patients who are already on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. This is because they work through a different mechanism, reducing intraglomerular pressure and hyperfiltration.

Option C is incorrect as well. While both metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors can potentially cause lactic acidosis, there is no general recommendation to reduce the dose of metformin or stop it altogether when an SGLT2 inhibitor is added. This decision should be individualized based on the patient's renal function and risk of lactic acidosis.

Option D is correct. The DAPA-CKD trial showed that the renal benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors were consistent across a spectrum of eGFRs, levels of albuminuria, and whether or not the patient had diabetes. This suggests that these benefits are not solely due to their glucose-lowering effects.

Therefore, the answer is [D. In the DAPA-CKD trial, the renal beneﬁts were consistent across the spectrum of eGFR, albuminuria, and the presence/absence of diabetes mellitus].
