## Answer
The patient's high urinary sodium excretion indicates a high dietary sodium intake. High sodium intake is associated with hypertension, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. This patient already has hypertension, as indicated by his blood pressure reading and the fact that he is on multiple antihypertensive medications. Therefore, his high sodium intake could potentially exacerbate his hypertension and increase his risk for cardiovascular events. The other options are not as directly related to the information given. While sodium and potassium excretion can be related to CKD progression, the question specifically asks about the implications of the patient's sodium and potassium excretion, and the most direct implication is the potential for increased cardiovascular risk due to high sodium intake. The patient's diabetes status is not mentioned, so option C cannot be definitively addressed.
Therefore, the answer is D. His urinary sodium excretion is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular events.
