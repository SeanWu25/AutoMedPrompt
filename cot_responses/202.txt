## Answer
To answer this question, we need to consider the current evidence regarding the use of rituximab and azathioprine in the maintenance of remission in ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV).

Option A suggests that rituximab is superior to azathioprine in maintaining remission of AAV. This is indeed supported by clinical trials, such as the RITAZAREM trial, which showed that rituximab was superior to azathioprine for preventing relapses in AAV.

Option B suggests that a rituximab dosing strategy based on B cell repopulation and/or changes in ANCA titer leads to fewer relapses and longer relapse-free survival than regular 6-monthly dosing. However, this is not supported by current evidence. The MAINRITSAN trial showed that a fixed schedule of rituximab infusions was as effective as a strategy based on B cell counts and ANCA titers in maintaining remission.

Option C suggests that there were no differences in rates of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) associated with the use of azathioprine and prednisone for 24 versus 48 months. This statement is not directly related to the comparison of rituximab and azathioprine for maintenance of remission in AAV.

Option D suggests that elderly patients tolerate corticosteroids well, but the use of cyclophosphamide for induction therapy is associated with higher rates of infectious complications. This statement is not directly related to the comparison of rituximab and azathioprine for maintenance of remission in AAV.

Therefore, the answer is [A. In a clinical trial comparing it with maintenance therapy with azathioprine, rituximab was superior at maintaining remission of AAV].
