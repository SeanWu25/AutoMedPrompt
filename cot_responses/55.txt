## Answer
The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest a diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. Cushing syndrome is characterized by excessive cortisol production, which can lead to hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. The patient's hypertension and hypokalemia are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's 24-hour urine free cortisol level is significantly elevated, further supporting the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. 

Decreased activity of 11Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Option A) can cause apparent mineralocorticoid excess syndrome, which can also present with hypertension and hypokalemia. However, this condition is typically associated with low cortisol levels, which is not the case in this patient.

Liddle syndrome (Option B) is a genetic disorder that results in increased sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule, leading to hypertension and hypokalemia. However, this condition is typically associated with low aldosterone levels, which is not the case in this patient.

Ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome (Option D) can cause Cushing syndrome, but it is typically associated with high levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which is not mentioned in the patient's laboratory findings.

Therefore, the answer is C. Cushing syndrome.
