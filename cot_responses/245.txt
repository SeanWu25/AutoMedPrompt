## Answer
The patient in the scenario is presenting with signs of cardiogenic shock, which is a severe condition that can lead to multiple organ failure, including acute kidney injury (AKI). The urine output of the patient is significantly low, indicating possible kidney dysfunction. 

Option A suggests that serum creatinine is a more sensitive marker for AKI in cardiogenic shock than urine output. However, both serum creatinine and urine output are important markers for kidney function and are used in the diagnosis of AKI. In the early stages of AKI, changes in urine output can be more sensitive than changes in serum creatinine.

Option B suggests that the amount of iodinated contrast medium used in coronary angiography is not associated with the development of AKI. This is incorrect as contrast-induced nephropathy is a well-known risk factor for AKI, especially in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or other risk factors.

Option C suggests that patients with stage 1 AKI have an increased risk of death compared to non-AKI patients. This is true, as even mild AKI is associated with increased mortality, especially in critically ill patients.

Option D suggests that more than 20% of patients with cardiogenic shock require kidney replacement therapy (KRT). While the exact percentage can vary, it is generally accepted that a significant proportion of patients with severe cardiogenic shock may require KRT due to AKI. However, stating a specific percentage like 20% might not be accurate.

Option E suggests that patients with higher central venous pressure and lower mean arterial pressure are more prone to AKI development. This is also true, as these conditions can lead to decreased renal perfusion and subsequent AKI.

Therefore, the answer is [C, E]. Both options C and E are correct statements regarding AKI development in cardiogenic shock.
