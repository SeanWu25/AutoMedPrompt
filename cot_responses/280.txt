## Answer
The patient's clinical presentation and test results are indicative of primary aldosteronism, also known as Conn's syndrome. This condition is characterized by excessive secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal glands, often due to an adrenal adenoma, which can lead to hypertension and hypokalemia. The diagnosis is confirmed by a high aldosterone-to-renin ratio and failure to suppress aldosterone secretion with sodium loading.

The next step in management after confirming the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism and identifying an adrenal nodule on imaging is to determine whether the aldosterone excess is due to a unilateral or bilateral adrenal process. This is important because the treatment of unilateral disease (ie, aldosterone-producing adenoma) is surgical resection, whereas bilateral adrenal hyperplasia is managed medically.

Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) is the gold standard for distinguishing between unilateral and bilateral disease. It involves the simultaneous measurement of aldosterone from both adrenal veins, and a significant gradient in aldosterone levels between the two sides indicates a unilateral source.

An MRI would not provide additional useful information in this case, as a CT scan has already identified an adrenal nodule. Lifelong spironolactone treatment could be an option if the patient had bilateral adrenal hyperplasia or was not a surgical candidate, but this has not been established yet. Surgical adrenalectomy is the treatment of choice for a unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma, but it should only be performed after lateralization with AVS.

Therefore, the answer is B. Order adrenal vein sampling.
