## Answer
The buttonhole needling technique involves the creation of a track in the skin and subcutaneous tissue over the arteriovenous fistula or graft by repeated cannulation at the exact same site and angle. This technique is often used in patients who self-cannulate for home hemodialysis. 

Option A suggests an increased risk of infectious complications. This is true as the buttonhole technique has been associated with an increased risk of local and systemic infections, including bacteremia and endocarditis. This is because the repeated use of the same cannulation site can lead to colonization by skin flora.

Option B suggests an increased rate of access survival. This is not necessarily true. While the buttonhole technique may reduce the risk of aneurysm formation and stenosis, it does not necessarily increase the overall survival of the access.

Option C suggests a decrease in cannulation-associated pain. This is true as the buttonhole technique, once the track is established, is often less painful than the rope ladder technique because the needle passes through the scar tissue rather than fresh tissue each time.

Option D suggests an increased rate of hematoma formation. This is not necessarily true. Hematoma formation is usually associated with incorrect needle insertion, which can occur with any cannulation technique.

Therefore, the answer is [C. A decrease in cannulation-associated pain].
