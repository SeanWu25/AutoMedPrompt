## Answer
The patient in question has several risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI) including his age, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the question asks for the strongest predictor of AKI in this specific scenario of nontraumatic hip arthroplasty.

A. Black race - While race can be a factor in certain health conditions, it is not typically considered the strongest predictor of AKI.

B. Diabetes mellitus - Diabetes can contribute to kidney damage over time, especially if poorly controlled. However, it is not the strongest predictor of AKI in the context of nontraumatic hip arthroplasty.

C. History of congestive heart failure - Congestive heart failure can lead to decreased blood flow to the kidneys, which can contribute to AKI. However, in this case, the patient's heart failure is well compensated, and there are no signs of fluid overload or low cardiac output.

D. Baseline CKD - Chronic kidney disease is a significant risk factor for AKI. Patients with CKD have already demonstrated a reduced ability to filter blood and eliminate waste products. Any additional stress on the kidneys, such as surgery, can potentially lead to AKI. 

Therefore, the answer is D. Baseline CKD.
