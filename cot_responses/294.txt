## Answer
The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage A3G4, which is a high-risk combination for cardiovascular disease. His blood pressure is slightly elevated, and his hemoglobin A1c is also above the target range for patients with diabetes, indicating suboptimal glycemic control. 

Option A suggests increasing the dose of empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. While SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes, the patient is already on empagliflozin, and increasing the dose may not provide additional benefits.

Option B suggests changing losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), to valsartan, another ARB. Both drugs have similar effects on blood pressure and kidney protection, and there is no clear evidence that valsartan is superior to losartan in terms of cardiovascular or renal outcomes.

Option D suggests adding finerenone, a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. While finerenone has been shown to reduce the risk of kidney and heart failure events in patients with CKD and type 2 diabetes, it is usually considered when the patient is not achieving the desired results with the current treatment.

Option C suggests adding semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist. GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to improve glycemic control, promote weight loss, and reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. Given the patient's suboptimal glycemic control and high BMI, adding semaglutide could help improve both these parameters and potentially improve his overall prognosis.

Therefore, the answer is [C. Add semaglutide starting at a dose of 0.5 mg subcutaneously once weekly].
