## Answer
Calciphylaxis, also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy, is a rare and serious disorder that presents with skin ischemia and necrosis. It is most commonly seen in patients with end-stage renal disease. The pathogenesis is not completely understood, but it is believed to involve calcification of the small and medium-sized blood vessels, leading to occlusion and tissue necrosis. 

Looking at the options, we can evaluate each one:

A. Low BMI: There is no strong evidence to suggest that low BMI is a risk factor for calciphylaxis. In fact, obesity is more commonly associated with an increased risk of calciphylaxis.

B. Low serum calcium level: Hypocalcemia is not a risk factor for calciphylaxis. In fact, hypercalcemia and high calcium-phosphate product are more commonly associated with an increased risk of calciphylaxis.

C. Use of IV epoetin: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents like epoetin have been associated with an increased risk of calciphylaxis. The exact mechanism is not known, but it is thought that these agents may increase blood pressure and vascular calcification, leading to an increased risk of calciphylaxis.

D. Ergocalciferol: There is no strong evidence to suggest that ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) is a risk factor for calciphylaxis. 

Therefore, the answer is C. Use of IV epoetin.
