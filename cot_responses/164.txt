## Answer
The question is asking about the factors that have contributed to the decline in ESRD incidence among Native Americans over the past 16 years. 

Option A suggests a population-based approach to diabetes care based in the community and the primary clinical setting. This approach could potentially lead to better management of diabetes, which is a major risk factor for ESRD. 

Option B suggests the transfer of diabetes care traditionally assigned to primary care providers to nephrologists. While this could potentially improve the quality of care, it is not clear how this would lead to a decrease in ESRD incidence.

Option C suggests the use of new glucose-lowering agents. While these could potentially improve diabetes management, it is not clear how they would lead to a decrease in ESRD incidence.

Option D suggests the prescription of fenofibrate in patients with CKD and serum triglyceride levels between 150 and 499 mg/dl. While this could potentially improve the management of CKD, it is not clear how this would lead to a decrease in ESRD incidence.

Given these considerations, the most likely factor associated with the decline in ESRD incidence among Native Americans over the past 16 years is a population-based approach to diabetes care based in the community and the primary clinical setting. This approach could potentially lead to better management of diabetes, which is a major risk factor for ESRD.

Therefore, the answer is [A].
