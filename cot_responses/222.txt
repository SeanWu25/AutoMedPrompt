## Answer
The International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) guidelines provide recommendations for the management of peritonitis in patients on peritoneal dialysis. According to the 2016 update of these guidelines, a review of sampling and culture methods should be carried out if the rate of culture-negative peritonitis is more than 20% among all peritonitis episodes. This is because a high rate of culture-negative peritonitis could indicate issues with the methods used to collect and culture samples, such as contamination or inadequate techniques. Therefore, the answer is [D. More than 20%].
