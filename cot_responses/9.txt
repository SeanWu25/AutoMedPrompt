## Answer
Beetroot juice is known to have a blood pressure-lowering effect. This is due to its high nitrate content, which is converted into nitric oxide in the body. Nitric oxide is a potent vasodilator, meaning it relaxes and widens blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure. However, the extent of this effect varies among individuals and is not as significant as the reduction that can be achieved with antihypertensive medications. 

Option A is incorrect because beetroot juice does not lower blood pressure by decreasing aldosterone production. Aldosterone is a hormone that increases the reabsorption of sodium and water in the kidneys, which can increase blood pressure. However, beetroot juice's effect on blood pressure is not related to aldosterone.

Option B is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that tachyphylaxis (a rapid decrease in the response to a drug after repeated doses) develops with beetroot juice.

Option C could be correct. Some studies have shown that beetroot juice can lower systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) by about 4-10 mmHg. However, the effect on diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) is less clear, and the reduction may not be as high as 5 mmHg.

Option D is incorrect because beetroot juice does not increase pulse wave reflection. Pulse wave reflection is a measure of arterial stiffness, and increased arterial stiffness is associated with higher blood pressure. Beetroot juice, by promoting vasodilation, would be expected to decrease, not increase, pulse wave reflection.

Option E is incorrect because beetroot juice is not a known cause of hypertension. On the contrary, it is generally considered to have a blood pressure-lowering effect.

Therefore, the answer is [C. Beetroot juice lowers ambulatory BP by about 8/5 mmHg compared with placebo]. However, it's important to note that while beetroot juice may have a modest effect on blood pressure, it should not be used as a substitute for prescribed antihypertensive medications.
