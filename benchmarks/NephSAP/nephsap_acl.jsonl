This patient\u2019s peritoneal equilibrium test shows an initial increase, and\nthen a decrease in the dialysate to plasma ratios (D/P) of creatinine, as well as loss of sodium sieving\ncharacteristic of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis. Figure 1 shows that the fall in the D/PNa+ ratio resulting\nfrom a decrease in the dialysate sodium concentration that is observed in normal sodium sieving is no longer\napparent. Hence, option C is the best answer. Morelle and coworkers suggested that abnormal peritoneal\ntransport heralds the development of EPS. In a cohort of 234 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients at a single\nacademic center in Europe over a 20-year period, a total of 7 patients developed EPS. As part of routine care, a\nmodified 3.86% glucose PET was performed yearly. When compared with long-term PD patients who did not\ndevelop EPS, affected patients showed an early decline in ultrafiltration. In fact, the accompanying loss of\nsodium sieving was the most potent predictor for the development of EPS. In a careful pathologic analysis of\nperitoneal biopsies, patients with EPS were found to have excessive vascular proliferation and fibrotic changes\nwhen compared to uremic or long-term PD patients who did not develop EPS. Further microscopic imaging\nrevealed that the quantity and density of collagen was increased in patients with EPS when compared to\ncontrols. Surprisingly, and despite the clinical hallmark of ultrafiltration failure, aquaporin-1 expression was\nsimilar in patients with EPS compared to unaffected controls on PD. This led the authors to hypothesize that\nspecific changes in the peritoneal make up, specifically a diseased collagen matrix, causes the decrease in\nosmotic conductance leading to ultrafiltration failure in EPS (rather than vasculopathy or the lack of aquaporin-\n1). The incidence of EPS is variable, but only a minority of patients develops EPS even after prolonged courses\nof peritoneal dialysis. Ultrafiltration failure due to a peritoneal dialysate leak (option A) or increased\nlymphatic absorption (option B) is characterized by stable D/P urea and creatinine ratios over time, unlike the\nresults noted in this woman; therefore, options A and B are incorrect. Patients with ultrafiltration failure due to\nhigh membrane transport characteristics have increased D/Pcreatinine ratios that exceed 0.8 and\nD/Pglucose ratios that are <0.3; thus, option D is incorrect.", "context": "A 62-year-old woman with ESRD maintained on PD for the last 8 years is evaluated in the PD clinic.

The maximum allowable bacterial level is 200 colony forming units per ml. Dialyzers act as an efficient ultrafilter and bacteria, fungi, and viruses are excluded from crossing the dialyzer membrane. At an absorptive capacity and molecular weight cutoff of 25-30 kilodaltons, intact dialyzer membranes protect patients cross-over of viable bacteria from dialysate to blood. In addition, current dialysis machines often incorporate a secondary ultrafilter in the dialysate pathway that adds additional protection from bacterial exposure. The physician must assess the most appropriate action is  optimal for each patient. Therefore, option D is correct. For example, a clinician may have to decide whether withholding dialysis on a patient requiring massive fluid removal or electrolyte control is more detrimental than continuing dialysis with a bacterial level above the maximum level. CMS regulation stipulates \u201cThe use of water outside of AAMI standards should be extremely rare. The medical director is ultimately responsible for this decision; short term exposure to contaminants is limited to one treatment, rather than not receiving dialysis may be the optimal choice.\u201d Bacteria in dialysis water could result in the presence of endotoxin and endotoxin fragments. The possible continuous exposure to endotoxin and endotoxin fragments could result in pyrogenic reactions and other inflammatory responses. In the setting of dialyzer reuse (where dialyzers are rinsed and reprocessed using reverse osmosis processed water), bacterial contamination of the water distribution system has resulted in patient bloodstream infections. Prophylactic antibiotics would be ineffective in mitigating the inflammatory response as a result from improperly maintained water quality and would result in unnecessary antibiotic exposure (option A is incorrect). Blood cultures would not detect the presence of endotoxin or endotoxin fragments (option B is incorrect). Decreasing dialysis and blood flow or changing to a different hemodialysis machine would not avert exposure to endotoxin and endotoxin fragments (options C and E are incorrect). Bacterial contamination must be addressed by chemical disinfection of the water distribution system, following by retesting of bacterial colony counts and endotoxin levels.
